      "      \"summary\": \"LoadingMs Berejiklian said she appreciated the message delivered on Friday was shocking, but that she needed 'everybody to be shocked'.'NSW is facing the biggest challenge we have faced since the pandemic started, and I don't say that lightly,' she said.'Unless there's a dramatic turnaround in the numbers, I can't see how we'll be in a position to ease restrictions by next Friday.'Do not leave your home. Do not leave your home unless you absolutely have to. That is what a lockdown is,' she said.Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said 43 people were currently in hospital due to COVID, with 10 people in ICU, four of whom are being ventilated.'Of the 10 people in ICU, one is in their 20s, one is in their 30s one is in their 50s, five are in their 60s and two are in their 70s,' she said.'This trend has to be turned around and the only way we can do so is by seeing a decline in numbers.'Dr Chant said people in suburbs like Kareela, Sylvania, Hurstville and Maroubra needed to stay particularly vigilant and come forward for testing.South-west Sydney remains of heightened concern, including suburbs like Bossley Park, Smithfield, Fairfield, West Hoxton, Bass Hill, Greenacre, St John's Park, Bonnyrigg, Bankstown, Canley Vale, Chester Hill and Edensor Park.Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday announced 300,000 extra vaccine doses would be fast-tracked to NSW to boost inoculations in south-west Sydney, targeting the 'most vulnerable in the community.'The doses will comprise equal components of both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines.Mr Morrison on Friday told Seven's Sunrise that Australia's vaccine troubles to date needed to be put into perspective.'We are in a global pandemic, it's as simple as that. Sadly, the program has had its challenges but ... when it comes to fatalities, deaths from COVID, that is the statistic, obviously, where Australia leads the world,' he said.'Just the other day, they had more cases in the UK in one day than Australia has had in the past 18 months. I think you've got to look at these things in balance'.A number of new western Sydney locations were added to NSW Health's list of COVID-19 exposure sites on Wednesday night, among them retail stores, cafes and supermarkets.Eleven of those are close contact sites, meaning anyone who attended at the relevant times must immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days no matter the result.The venues include Aldi and Kmart in Merrylands, both on Monday, July 5, between 1.30 and 3.30pm and Australia Post in Merrylands on July 5, from 2-3pm.Other venues include Kathmandu Burwood on July 4, from 12.35-1pm, Beds r Us Wetherill Park on July 5, between 2.30 and 3.15pm, as well as food outlets in Auburn and Smithfield.Sydney's hospitals are standing by to mobilise COVID-19 surge plans in preparation for the possible influx of people needing urgent care, with more than 10 per cent of the state's cases now in hospital.As the number of cases in intensive care climbs, the Australian Medical Association has warned the health system would be overwhelmed if the Greater Sydney lockdown was eased before spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant is contained.Stay across the most crucial developments related to the pandemic with the Coronavirus Update.

      "      \"summary\": \"Commentary\\n BC Pires \\n 2 Hrs Ago BC Pires - \\nTHANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY\\n\\n\\nBC PIRES\\n\\nLAST THURSDAY, 18,000-odd 11-year-olds sat the Secondary Entrance Assessment, all hoping to pass for a 'prestige school' which, in Trinidad, means one where the teachers are more worried about their students getting nine CXCs under their belt than they already having TEC Nines in their book bags. \\nLast Friday, I did the maths section of a Newsday practice test. Today I will wrestle with what we now call 'language arts' because we're too ashamed of how poorly we do 'English.' \\n\\nLanguage Arts. Section I. \\n \\nTask 1. Correct the six spelling mistakes:\\nSimba sirveyed the bed below him. The new dog, which the humans affectionatly called 'Chino,' was sleeping contently on it. Simba wanted to play! He swished his tale, wiggled and pounced on the creature. Chino howled and jumped! Simba felt satisfyed. The spelling mistakes are obvious, apart from 'contently' for 'contentedly,' which modern 11-year-olds will think isn't a mistake at all, because they will think it refers to 'content,' ie, any stupid 15-second video they post on TikTok, but you have to look for the cultural/socio-economic errors. Unless Simba and Chino are pets in a stoosh household, eg, what the firetruck are they doing on the bed? Except possibly in Westmoorings, Trinidad dogs are outside in the rain. With one end of an old rope tied around their neck and the other to a mango tree valued more highly than them. \\n\\nTask 2. Correct the six punctuation and capitalisation errors:\\nromano observed the tadpoles and fish darting between rocks in the pond As he stared at them in awe a voice shouted, 'Boo'. romano fell into the pond. His brother, Trevor, exclaimed, Got you!' There is a lot more wrong with poor Romano than not having his name capitalised, such as having a surname for a forename and not having a PS4 or any gaming platform at all \\u2013 otherwise why would he be in awe of tadpoles and fish darting in a firetrucking pond? This is a little boy in Trinidad, not Sir David Attenborough on the BBC. Romano's biggest problem, though, is clearly his brother, Trevor, who got the good first name and who has poor Romano in such an extended state of hyper-anxiety, he needs to watch tadpoles to calm down. Romano's best correction will be to NEVER stand near the edge of any precipice if Trevor is within shouting distance. \\n\\nTask 3. Correct the six grammar errors:\\nBlack vultures known as 'corbeaux' at Trinidad are important to the environment and helps to keep it clean. Despite they reputation around being dirty, black vultures often clean itself by bathing in rivers and streams. Before the grammatically incorrect, we must deal with the politically incorrect, viz, why are the vultures being described as 'black?' It is now racist to use 'black' as a descriptive, following the penalising of the European football club official who identified the only black person on the field by saying, 'the black guy' instead of, say, 'the third-tallest player on the team that is losing at the moment' or 'the player nearest the goalpost who is not the goalie, no, wait, the player who is second-nearest\\u2026 no, wait, third-nearest\\u2026no, wait\\u2026'\\nThere is also a distinct possibility of anti-Indian racism coming into play because the dirty black vultures clean themselves by bathing in rivers. Why not the sea? Why the river? To me, the imputation is clear that there must be some duck currying in a pot somewhere, ergo, the most correctest thing to do is to set all future SEA questions in villages in England, with rosy-cheeked blonde children doing all the heavy-social media-storm-avoiding-lifting in the exam questions. \\nWe could even do the maths section with sums out of my old 1969 arithmetic textbooks, which required Trinidadian children to add up and subtract pounds, shillings and pence. \\nAnd then we could formally reverse independence. \\nAnd maybe come out of it and into West Indian Federation next time. \\nChanges to the SEA have made it impossible to do, in a newspaper column, the 'comprehension,' or to write what used to be 'the essay' but is now, regrettably, 'ELA \\u2013 presumably English Language Arts \\u2013 Writing.' \\nWhich starts with something called 'Prewriting,' further sub-divided into Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action and Resolution, which sounds more like a Friday night in a club and a quarrel and she went home than a primary school essay. That's enough SEA to drown in. \\n\\nBC Pires is a dunce with Newsday and, ergo, about to be appointed to the Cabinet. Read the full version of this column on Saturday at www.BCPires.com\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"CONTRIBUTOR To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. COVID 19 virus took the world by surprise. It started as small China problem and subsequently to become a global pandemic \\u2013 the entire world problem. The net effect has been that national governments have to impose strict measures including lockdowns, social distancing, wearing of face masks, washing of hands and others to minimize the catastrophic effect of it. Notwithstanding the above, lives are been lost daily and infection rates are still at its peak. Businesses has also had their fair share of the catastrophic effect of the pandemic. Businesses have been folded up, some struggling and others working on rotation basis. Scientist advised that the surest way to get pandemic under control is to get all and sundry vaccinated to minimize the spread, avoid severe illness and death. Unfortunately hand full of covid 19 vaccines have been approved, by relevant bodies, to be safe and effective to fight the covid.\\u00a0 Recently Ghana's Government in an effort to minimize and control the various managed to secure about 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Vaccine for the country. The doses imported were not enough to vaccinate the entire population, however, at some point more vaccines will be approved and there will be enough vaccines for all persons who are willing to be vaccinated. Notwithstanding the obvious benefits of the vaccines, there is still high rate of potential vaccination hesitancy. Several people both young and old have decided not to take the vaccination. Some attribute it to religious beliefs; trust in the efficacy of the vaccine and others conspiracy theories. So far there is no law or policy in Ghana that makes the vaccination mandatory. However some employers in their quest to return business back to normal and also to complying with their obligations under the 1992 constitution and the Labour law may make policies and decisions that will compel employees to take the vaccine. We will discuss whether such measure or policies can be lawful? OBLIGATION ON EMPLOYERS TO MAKE WORK PLACE SAFE AND HEALTHY Employers who may want to make Covid 19 vaccination mandatory at their work places will argue that by the combine effect of Article 24(1) of the 1992 constitution and Sections 10(a) and 188(1) impose a duty on employers to ensure that every worker employed by it works under satisfactory, safe and healthy conditions. Creating a satisfactory, safe and healthy conditions include taking reasonable and practical steps to minimize or prevention the spread of Covid 19 virus at the work place. And one of the reasonable and practical steps is making Covid 19 vaccination mandatory.\\u00a0 EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO REJECT VACCINATION Whiles employers have to right to make Covid 19 policy mandatory, the Employees on the other hand also have the right to refuse vaccination. Employees have a fundamental human right which is guaranteed under the constitution to refuse or accept any medication of any sort. Therefore a person cannot be compelled without their consent to undergo medical treatment, including vaccination. On that basis, employees can also reject any attempt to compel them to undergo vaccination treatment. BALANCING RIGHT The rights of the employer and the employees indicated above, none of it can be classified as an absolute right. Therefore in the event they contradicts none will automatically takes precedence over the other. This means any potential mandatory policy cannot automatically takes precedence over an individual fundamental right and freedom to decide whether or not to take the medication. When such event happens, employers to avoid any potential liability, should be prepared to justify such policy.\\u00a0 The employer should be prepared to justified that aside the mandatory requirement there were no practical alternatives or mechanisms that was sufficient enough to meet their obligations. Another justification may be that the nature of the work employees were undertaking is such that it has become necessary that they undergo the vaccination exercise. In a decided case in Canada, specifically, employers engaged in the provision of health care and residential care services, especially those catering to the elderly or immunocompromised, it was found that it was justified in temporarily removing employees who refuse to be vaccinated. The policy must also be connected to the employer's legitimate business interest. A mandatory policy that protects employees, client and patient health and safety have been held to be legitimate business interest in other jurisdiction. WHAT EMPLOYERS MUST DO Notwithstanding that Employers may have a legitimate right to impose mandatory vaccination, it is highly recommended that they encourage voluntary vaccination. Employers can also introduce incentives to staff to encourage them to vaccinate. Further most of the vaccine hesitancy are due to little information or misinformation about the vaccination. Employers can seek help of health professionals to educate their employees about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine to alley any fears they might harbor. Notwithstanding the above, if it becomes necessary that the policy has to be implemented, the employer should ensure that the policy does not contradict with the existing employment agreement or collective agreement. The policy should also not be unreasonable. Last but not the least the policy should be clear and unequivocal.

      "      \"summary\": \"Govt's last Covid chance\\n\\nToday, the Centre for Covid19 Situation Administration (CCSA) meets to debate imposing more stringent Covid measures in Bangkok and its vicinity as well as the the four southernmost provinces in a new bid to battle Covid-19.\\n\\nIn doing so, the CCSA has deliberately avoided using the term \\\"lockdown.\\\" The measures, nevertheless, amount to a soft lockdown.\\n\\nSet to take effect for 14 days, the steps would lead to Bangkok and its vicinity being sealed off, with inter-provincial travel banned.\\n\\nEssential businesses still will be allowed to operate, while shopping malls, supermarkets and fresh markets will be asked to cut their hours. Some businesses may even be asked to close their doors for two weeks.\\n\\nPeople will be asked to stay home, and go out only when necessary such as to buy food. The quasi-lockdown measures were proposed by the Ministry of Public Health, with a clear and singular mission -- to prevent the public healthcare system from collapsing as the number of patients outstrips the capacity of state hospitals to treat them.\\n\\nThe CCSA forecasts that total Covid cases might surpass 10,000 cases per day by next week.\\n\\nThe public health crisis justifies the semi-lockdown measures despite their potential knockout effect on the economy.\\n\\nYet the Prayut government cannot afford a repeat the mistakes it made in managing the crisis over the past 18 months.\\n\\nThis time, the government must respond quickly as needs arise to inject money, soft loans, grants or even give relief items directly to affected business and workers to help them make ends meet.\\n\\nAs the 14-day Covid measure will hit daily wage workers and street vendors hardest, the government must make sure they have enough food and money to survive.\\n\\nBut the most urgent priority is for the CCSA's operations centre to work harder and smarter to control people's movements including risk groups such as labourers.\\n\\nIn past 18 months, it has failed in this crucial task. Take the persistent problem of illegal entry by migrant workers from neighbouring countries which has led to cluster infections. One glaring example came early this month when hundreds of construction workers managed to flee their camps as the state tried to lock the camps down, leading to Covid infections in more than 30 provinces. Needless to say, failure is not an option this time.\\n\\nAnd no more flip flops on vaccines. The Public Health Ministry has revised its vaccination plan regularly to accommodate the needs of the economy and the state's plans to reopen the country.\\n\\nBut as the latest Covid measures are designed with public health as the uppermost concern, the ministry must regain its focus and spend every minute it can on providing quality vaccines to vulnerable groups including the elderly, not to mention front-line workers.\\n\\nIt must also accelerate Covid testing capacity in the capital as well as build more Covid isolation and field hospitals.\\n\\nThe government has 14 days, its last chance to restore battered public confidence in its performance.\\n\\nOf course, the new quasi-lockdown will trigger debate and it is impossible for the government to satisfy everyone in a country that has been so polarised; but the government can help bridge the gap and unite people by being transparent, accountable and fair.\\n\\nAnything else, and the next 14 days could spell the end for this government.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"In a new study assessing the potential of a single-dose, intranasal COVID-19 vaccine, a team from the University of Iowa and the University of Georgia found that the vaccine fully protects mice against lethal COVID-19 infection. The vaccine also blocks animal-to-animal transmission of the virus. The findings were published July 2 in the journal Science Advances.\\n\\nThe currently available vaccines against COVID-19 are very successful, but the majority of the world's population is still unvaccinated and there is a critical need for more vaccines that are easy to use and effective at stopping disease and transmission. If this new COVID-19 vaccine proves effective in people, it may help block SARS-CoV-2 transmission and help control the COVID-19 pandemic.\\\" Paul McCray, MD, professor of pediatrics-pulmonary medicine, and microbiology and immunology at the UI Carver College of Medicine, and co-leader of the study\\n\\nUnlike traditional vaccines that require an injection, this vaccine is administered through a nasal spray similar to those commonly used to vaccinate against influenza. The vaccine used in the study only requires a single dose and it may be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures for up to at least three months. Because it is given intranasally, the vaccine may also be easier to administer, especially for those who have a fear of needles.\\n\\n\\\"We have been developing this vaccine platform for more than 20 years, and we began working on new vaccine formulations to combat COVID-19 during the early days of the pandemic,\\\" says Biao He, PhD, a professor in the University of Georgia's Department of Infectious Diseases in the College of Veterinary Medicine and co-leader of the study. \\\"Our preclinical data show that this vaccine not only protects against infection, but also significantly reduces the chances of transmission.\\\"\\n\\nThe experimental vaccine uses a harmless parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into cells where it prompts an immune response that protects against COVID-19 infection. PIV5 is related to common cold viruses and easily infects different mammals, including humans, without causing significant disease. The research team has previously shown that this vaccine platform can completely protect experimental animals from another dangerous coronavirus disease called Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\\n\\nThe inhaled PIV5 vaccine developed by the team targets mucosal cells that line the nasal passages and airways. These cells are the main entry point for most SARS-CoV-2 infections and the site of early virus replication. Virus produced in these cells can invade deeper into the lungs and other organs in the body, which can lead to more severe disease. In addition, virus made in these cells can be easily shed through exhalation allowing transmission from one infected person to others.\\n\\nThe study showed that the vaccine produced a localized immune response, involving antibodies and cellular immunity, that completely protected mice from fatal doses of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine also prevented infection and disease in ferrets and, importantly, appeared to block transmission of COVID-19 from infected ferrets to their unprotected and uninfected cage-mates.\",\n",

I live in Portugal and was only in the UK for 11 days and the rules were changed when I was there. I quarantined for 10 days before returning to Portugal and have had 5 laboratory PCR tests in the last 12 days, all negative. I see in the news that Ant\\u00f3nio Costa had 1 PCR test and was able to leave quarantine. This is clearly a case of Politicians not wanting to adhere to their own rules. They are happy to imprison everyone else but for them it is clearly not applicable, when they should be leading by example. Don't get me wrong I am not trying to avoid doing the quarantine, I am simply wanting an exception to get my second vaccine dose which all the ministers (Cabrita, Sales etc) are reported as saying this is the nations priority. This is completely crazy, unfair and stupid, and I think this is something that needs to be reported to the public. Best regardsCRAIG ANDERSON By email\",\n",

The Prime Minister said South Australians who returned from 'low-risk' countries would be able to participate in the pilot. Mr Morrison said SA indicated its interest in hosting the two-week pilot program \\u2014 which will be based on the advice from a medical panel \\u2014 at Friday's meeting. He said the project would be transparent, with all the other states and territories observing the outcome. '(This is) so they are in a position to pick up that project on the completion of a successful pilot program,' Mr Morrison said. 'We will work with them (SA) now to set up a time frame of how that will be put together and transparency arrangements for the other states and territories.'Mr Morrison said it was 'an important development' that could take significant pressure off of the quarantine system, if successful. Premier Steven Marshall said the state's response to the pandemic put it in 'an ideal position' to volunteer for the trial that would be under 'stringent safety protocols'. He said it would likely include returning Paralympians or ADF personnel who received the vaccine in Australia.'It will progress only under strict safety and surveillance measures and only when approved by our public health experts,' Mr Marshall said.'While we will be the first jurisdiction to return South Australians through home quarantine, it is expected other states will then adopt the system.'Earlier on Friday, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said both SA and NSW had previously expressed interest in participating in a small-scale trial where alternative quarantine options could be explored. 'One of the things the work done so far tells us is that a vaccinated person quarantining for seven days is stronger than an unvaccinated person quarantining for 14 days,' she told ABC radio.As part of SA's public health response, it established a dedicated Covid-19 positive medi-hotel where people who contracted the virus were transferred to complete 14 days of isolation. There are other hotels across the CBD where returned travellers whose tests were negative undergo their fortnight of quarantine.

      "      \"excerpt\": \"Hundreds of thousands are dead, partly thanks to the Kremlin's incompetence | Europe\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"FOR THE past year the Kremlin has trumpeted its success in fighting covid-19. It eschewed lockdowns and hailed its home-grown Sputnik V vaccine. In early June, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, boasted to thousands of guests at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, billed as the world's largest post-pandemic international gathering, that 'the current situation in Russia allows us to hold such events without any particular risk of spreading the infection.'In fact, by the time Mr Putin was addressing his powwow, Russian doctors had for several weeks been registering an alarming rise in infections and deaths. A month later, Russia is in the midst of its third and most severe wave of covid-19, with more people dying daily than at any point during the pandemic (see chart).The number of new daily cases is currently around 25,000, somewhat fewer than in Britain, and rising. But whereas in Britain this surge has translated into an average of 18 daily deaths over the past week, in Russia it has resulted in an average of 670 deaths a day.The contrast is all the more striking because Russia was the first country in the world to approve a working vaccine, one based on the same science as the British-Swedish AstraZeneca one and apparently just as effective. But whereas in Britain 78% of the population has received at least one jab, in Russia the proportion is only 20%. The difference is not the availability or the efficacy of the jab, but people's trust in the government and its vaccines.All of this could have been avoided. A year ago the government decided to lift a partial lockdown (Mr Putin called it 'a holiday'), hoping to save itself money and to prop up the president's faltering popularity after a prolonged slump in incomes. Mr Putin's ratings did go back up\\u2014but so did the risk of infection.As the second wave hit Europe in late autumn last year, the Kremlin chose not to spend money on supporting people and businesses through a new lockdown. It left people to their own devices, playing down the risks, with Mr Putin boasting about the contrast between lifeless European cities and Moscow, where restaurants, theatres and shops stayed open.But the numbers lied. By February 2021 Russia had one of the world's highest excess mortality rates, according to numbers compiled by The Economist. At that point it had registered 460,000 more deaths than normal, while its official covid-19 death toll was a more modest 85,000. But by in effect removing all restrictions and fiddling the numbers, the government managed to create a false sense of security.This was just when people should have been urged to get vaccinated, says Denis Volkov of the Levada Centre, an independent pollster. Despite the staggering true number of deaths, in February his polling found that 57% of people were not worried about catching the virus. Most worryingly, two-thirds of the country rejected the idea of getting vaccinated.The government, meanwhile, had other priorities, such as jailing Alexei Navalny, the most prominent opposition figure, and crushing street protests. This is where social-distancing rules came in handy. Mr Navalny's associates were put under house arrest for 'urging the public to violate epidemiological restrictions'. At the same time Mr Putin packed 80,000 people into the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow for a ceremony to mark the seventh anniversary of the annexation of Crimea.Many Russians concluded that the rules were merely a government ploy, to be evaded like so many of its prescriptions. They took a similarly dismissive view of the Sputnik V vaccine after its launch, with much fanfare, in early December.Sputnik V was authorised before the results of its phase-3 clinical trials were ready. Once these were published, questions were raised about some inconsistencies and data availability, says Boris Reizis, a professor of immunology at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine. Still, he says, the data suggest that Sputnik V is at least as safe and effective as other adenovirus-based vaccines, such as those made by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. But the damage had been done.To be sure, confidence in vaccines is fragile everywhere. But in Russia nobody has done more to undermine such confidence than the Kremlin and its loyal, conspiracy-peddling media. Mr Putin has hijacked Sputnik V for the purpose of geopolitical point-scoring. Yet he dithered with his own vaccination until the end of March and refused to be photographed being injected, despite his usual penchant for bare-chested publicity stunts. He has also suggested that vaccines from other countries are unsafe.That has done little to reassure the many Russians who expect their government to lie to them. They have good reason: it turns out that some people who were told they were getting Sputnik V were in fact given EpiVacCorona, another Russian vaccine praised by Mr Putin, but about which there are serious concerns. Hardly any countries have approved it.Failing to win trust, Russian authorities are resorting to sticks and carrots. In Moscow, restaurants and caf\\u00e9s are allowed to serve people indoors only if they have a QR code proving they have been vaccinated. Hospitals refuse routine treatment to anyone without a jab. Public-sector and service workers have been ordered to get vaccinated. But although more people are now signing up for jabs, there is a side-effect: a thriving black market for fake vaccination certificates, QR codes and medical exemptions. None of this bodes well for hospitals across the country, as the numbers continue to mount. \\u25a0Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub.

      "      \"summary\": \"In response to Nicholas White and colleagues, we offer these clarifications. WHO guideline development methods are prespecified, abiding by principles for producing trustworthy guidelines. The WHO COVID-19 Therapeutics Guideline Development Group (GDG) is composed of external experts, with geographical representation and gender balance, including COVID-19 survivors, ethicists, and methodologists who are vetted for potential conflicts of interest. The GDG prioritises outcomes and identifies subgroups to be considered for each recommendation, always including age and disease severity (using WHO COVID-19 definitions of non-severe, severe, and critical). As WHO guidelines need to be globally applicable, the GDG deliberately used these disease severity classifications, based on clinical indicators, to assess subgroup effects rather than stage of disease (viral and inflammatory phases). The GDG avoided using access to health care (inpatient or outpatient) to define patient subgroups because who is admitted to hospital, when, and how can differ substantially across jurisdictions.The meta-analysis team did a network meta-regression based on the prespecified subgroup variables, focusing on within-trial rather than between-trial comparisons. The GDG assessed the credibility of results from the subgroup analyses using the Instrument to assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses tool,4Schandelmaier S Briel M Varadhan R et al.Development of the Instrument to assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) in randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.CMAJ. 2020; 192: e901-e906Crossref\\nPubMed\\nScopus (0)\\nGoogle Scholar which uses structured questions to derive an overall credibility rating. Regarding hydroxychloroquine treatment for COVID-19: after assessing results, the GDG concluded there was no credible subgroup effect for disease severity and thus issued a strong recommendation against hydroxychloroquine that applied across severities. Finally, WHO has issued separate guidelines for therapeutics and prophylactic drugs, with separate analyses for these indications, thus never pooling efficacy estimates for drugs used to treat COVID-19 with estimates of effects to prevent the disease.

In the largest randomised controlled trial in patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (ie, the RECOVERY trial), dexamethasone at a low dose reduced mortality in the prospectively defined subgroups of patients requiring medical oxygen (rate ratio 0\\u00b782 [95% CI 0\\u00b772\\u20130\\u00b794]) or being ventilated (0\\u00b764 [0\\u00b751\\u20130\\u00b781]) but not in patients not receiving respiratory support at randomisation (1\\u00b719 [0\\u00b791\\u20131\\u00b755]).

Unfortunately, they do not address our main concern: the unjustified extrapolation of evidence from randomised controlled trials in severe COVID-19 to therapeutic guidelines for uncomplicated illness.1 Pooling summary data from studies with different severity definitions, deciding on inappropriate primary outcomes, and extrapolating from results in hospitalised patients to ambulant individuals with mild infections suggests a worrying lack of clinical judgement.

      "      \"summary\": \"A full movement control order has been in place nationwide since 1 June 2021. Although it has brought some respite and an easing of the pandemic in some states, the condition has been seriously worsening recently in both the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, with both areas contributing more than 60% of the new cases in the country. KL and Selangor's consistent R-naught value of above 1.0 may be reflective of increasing transmission, and the increasing cases are pushing healthcare capacities in the region to a breaking point. The spread between new cases and recovered cases that started to widen early this week (July 4) was the red alert indicating healthcare systems struggling to cope with surging cases. This prompted the authority to enhance MCO in most areas in KL and Selangor from July 3 to July 16. The overall testing intensity nationwide has been on a general decline while test positivity rate has been soaring higher (Figure 1). Figure 1: New cases, new tests and positivity rate by weeks (Data Source: Ministry of Health, Malaysia) However a breakdown of the numbers shows that some states are testing more than others, including Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. Despite Kuala Lumpur and Selangor testing more than most states (especially Selangor with testing numbers roughly 2 - 3 times that of Kuala Lumpur), the corresponding high test positive rates could indicate that the spread may already be too wide. Therefore, Selangor should focus on containment strategies and vaccination while ideally maintaining the relatively higher levels of testing. Other states, including KL, may need to increase testing alongside strict containment and vaccination. In consideration of resource allocations, we refer to our suggestion that the testing exercise ride on the vaccination campaigns, utilising the same place and manpower available. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that Kuala Lumpur and Selangor are the busiest business areas. Every day of the prolonged and stringent lockdown brings more micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) closer to the cliff. Therefore, the situation requires an urgent, strategic, multipronged and unprecedented response to not only alleviate the situation but to minimise possibility of its painful recurrence. To achieve this, EMIR Research builds on our earlier 'Exit Strategy Building Blocks for Malaysia' published on Jun 17, 2021. The three main goals remain: 1) complete lockdown, 2) extending safety net to KL and Selangor and 3) speed up vaccination. However, given the urgency of the situation whereby every day matters, we bring in new and important strategic tactic based on robust scientific evidence. Firstly, a total lockdown is crucial. If done correctly i.e, a real 'total' lockdown in KL and Selangor for at least 2 weeks to a maximum of 6 weeks as was intended at the start of MCO 3.0 will help cut transmission, slow down new infections and ease the distressful healthcare situation in these states. Secondly, extended strictness and time of the lockdown will require a deepening of the safety net for vulnerable lives and businesses in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, Among the specific recommendations which EMIR Research would like to reemphasize is the automatic opt-out loan moratorium and enhanced renters' protection for all\\u2014individuals and MSMEs in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. The basic principle of financial management tells us that it is possible to survive the income downfall if you can reduce your operating and financial leverage\\u2014this is where the Government will need to deepen its approach. Therefore, to mitigate the proposed total lockdown in Kuala Ku and Selangor, the Government should mandate and closely monitor the implementation of a true automatic opt-out loan moratorium for all with no change of terms or interest / fee charge attributed to the months of the moratorium period. This is a serious issue as some banks may still try to leverage the 'opt-in' feature. At least for Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Government should also consider changing the incentive approach with the landlords into the form of temporary law measures similar to other countries. For instance, the Government could temporarily mandate equitable co-sharing of rental obligations between the Government, landlords and tenants and make eviction illegal, at least until we transit into Phase 3 of the National Recovery Plan. The biggest share should be by the Government, followed by the landlord, and minimally (or none) born by the tenants. Lastly, but not least, is to increase the rate of vaccination as thus far it has been our best bet against the raging pandemic and the only hope for speedy return to some form of normalcy. The objective of massive vaccination is to at least protect larger proportion of population from the disease severity, hospitalizations, and deaths, even if infection was to happen. However, given, and only given the urgency of the situation, the same objective can be achieved through exploiting natural immunity to Covid-19 to win precious time and save lives and livelihoods. Notably, this idea has been mooted by the scientists since the start of 2021. To date, there are at least eight credible peer-reviewed studies published in reputable medical journals that aim to ascertain whether natural Covid-19 infection offers protection against this infection and how lasting it is. All eight studies are done in various periods during the year 2020 (before the vaccines), in various countries such as Austria [1], Denmark [2], Qatar [3], Switzerland [4], United Kingdom [5, 6], United States [7, 8]. Two were done among the healthcare workers while the rest on a nationwide samples. To trace infection or reinfection these studies used PCR tests, serological tests or both. Importantly, those who used both approaches found remarkable similarity in their results. Unanimously, these studies established the strong empirical evidence of protection from Covid-19 following natural infection (estimated efficacy ranging from 79% to 95%) lasting 7 months at average among these studies (as seen from the range of the observed period where this estimated efficacy was measured). Interestingly, both studies at the lower side of the efficacy range have been done in the medical setting where lower efficacy could be explained by higher levels of exposure to viruses and higher viral load received. Furthermore, three out of eight studies observed the protection rate increasing towards the end of observation period. Importantly, the majority of reinfections were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Only five cases of hospitalization after re-infection were reported across the studies and only one study reported 1 death out of 14,840 previously infected people, involving a 72 year old person. These findings are especially important in the view that available antibody assays measuring neutralizing antibodies may observe lowering antibody titre after a few months post infection, which is also a scenario that has been reported for Covid-19. However, the protection against severe symptoms, strong evidence of which we observe in the above studies, could be manifestation of the fact that the protection of the immune system involves more than just antibodies and include other important immune actors such as T cells and B cells, which may not be measured in current Covid-19 assays and may play an important role in what we observe. This is a well-established mechanism of immune response to many diseases. Due to significant cost involved in capturing this deeper immune response, the relevant studies are rather scarce. One such very recent longitudinal study published in Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal, assessed the immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. By continuously examining blood of 254 Covid-19 confirmed cases (age 19 to 81) the scientists established that despite antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) declined moderately over 8 months, memory B cells against SARS-CoV-2 spike actually increased between 1 month and 8 months after infection. About 95% of subjects retained immune memory at about 6 months after infection. Therefore, all these findings very plausibly suggest the possibility to exploit natural immunity and prioritise vaccination for those never been infected at least in the short-term (which can be as long as 7 months post infection) in the situation of shortage of either vaccine or time or both. The only exception should be naturally infected elderlies (as one study did find significantly lower protection of those 65 and above), people with comorbidities and those whose vascular and other vital systems have been severely damaged during the first infection. This approach also capitalises on the vast number of people infected in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, which may be excluded first, to make way for others to be vaccinated. In other words, there are justifiable grounds based on empirical studies that most of the infected people would retain infection immunity within the said months, or at least, would still have protective immunity against severe symptoms. Therefore, in practice, particularly in an extraordinary emergency setting, these individuals may be treated like 'vaccinated' individuals for a set period of time. Thus, by temporarily excluding these individuals, the target of maximising protection to the population of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor may be significantly expedited. As vaccine doses arrive in the span of the coming months, these naturally infected people that were postponed for their vaccination, can then start to receive their jabs. The efforts to increase throughput of vaccination in KL and Selangor such as door-to-door vaccination for the bedridden can also supplement the vaccine prioritisation/postponement strategy. It must be stated here that this does not mean getting infected is a good strategy, especially when we have vaccines. It is only an emergency measure in view of the need to speed up population protection and/or in the backdrop of vaccine scarcity. Fatality rates of infections without prior immunity (be it from vaccines or natural infection) appear to strongly suggest Covid-19 to be more lethal than your average flu. Some sources estimate the fatality rate is 10 times more than the common cold. Therefore, doing nothing and taking infection lightly will not be the solution and would be detrimental in the grander scheme towards recovery. Following the above tactic, while in full lockdown the authorities should start with the factories, various service companies and construction sectors in KL and Selangor as they continue to be the largest cluster contributors. Therefore, and favourably enough to this strategy, the large number of workers might be already protected with the natural immunity. The authorities may start with first screening workers IC / ID in the national epidemiological reporting system among previously PCR-confirmed cases and exclude those who are falling within the aforementioned protection period. For example, if the postponement period target is 1 month for the naturally-infected population, then we can consider only those that were infected and recovered in the last 6 months. Beyond 1 month of this strategy, the infected people can then be treated normally given the assumption that we have no vaccine supply issues and that by this time most, if not all population in KL and Selangor have been protected. For conservatism and in leaning even more towards safety, authorities may even consider a shorter period than the seven-months average duration, though the trade-off would reduce the number of eligible naturally-infected people that can be considered for exclusion. One particular aspect that has not been directly addressed by the sources mentioned or studied is the impact of new and emerging virus variants against the immunity of naturally infected and recovered people. It is postulated that these individuals may confer some level of protection against some variants (at least those that have not mutated too significantly) since natural infection may illicit not only the production of neutralising antibodies based on only one target antigen (like the spike, for example), but also triggering immune response involving other crucial immune components such as T and B cells by involving not only the spike but other parts of the virus that may be less susceptible to mutations. One way to begin elucidating and verifying this hypothesis is to also conduct antibody measurements and virus sequencing as mentioned earlier. Similar to the vaccine postponement strategy, any negative findings here may call for the approach to be reconsidered. Overall, this strategy has very calculated risk given the ample empirical support. Furthermore it can be treated as a case study and if successful extended to other states of Malaysia to near our recovery. The rakyat is suffering and it requires urgent, strategic, multipronged and unprecedented response guided by science and economic needs.

      "      \"summary\": \"With a\\u00a0significant increase in new COVID cases, Kerala has taken the national average of daily caseload up for the first time in two months. Even as the country's daily COVID count halved in the last one month, the state has been recording a steady 11,000 to 13,000 cases every day.Nearly every other state has been recording a decline in daily case count, according to a report in The Indian Express. The state breached the 15,000 mark twice this week on July 6 and 7. On Thursday, the state reported 13,772 fresh cases. The test positivity rate was at a high 10.83 percent.According to the report, in a way, the first wave never ended in Kerala as the state continued to record 5,000-6,000 cases every day in January 2021, when even Maharashtra's daily count fell to 2,000. A similar scenario seems to be playing out now.Although Kerala's new caseload has been higher, the relatively fewer deaths can be attributed to the state's better handling of the pandemic. On the other hand, the low fatality ratio of 0.47, against the country's average of 1.32, can partly be because of the large number of cases. Higher case count can also be partly attributed to better reporting, proven by serosurveys. The last national serosurvey showed that for every infection that is detected, about 25 go unreported. A similar survey in Kerala earlier this year found only about five unreported infections for every reported case.'When a person tests positive, we test all close contacts of that person, family members, etc. This kind of targeted testing is keeping the test positivity rate high,' the reported quoted Veena George, Kerala's new Health Minister.George had also said that the state always ensured that the total caseload always remained within the capacity of its health infrastructure.In the first meeting with new ministers after the cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concerns over the persistently high cases from Kerala and Maharashtra. He stressed that there should be no space for carelessness or complacency, a source told PTI.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"This week the UK government announced the roadmap for the full re-opening of the events sector in England from 19 July. Events businesses will need consider the latest guidance on the use of COVID-status certification.\\n\\nOver the last year we have become accustomed to the sight of \\u2018behind closed doors' events and reduced capacity crowds, whilst a huge number of live events have of course been cancelled. Recent weeks have seen fantastic scenes with fans attending Royal Ascot, large crowds at Wembley for Euro 2020 matches and the prospect of a full Centre Court for the Wimbledon Championship finals. However these recent mass-events have all taken place under the government's pilot Event Research Programme, which mandated strict requirements of vaccination status and negative COVID tests (so called COVID-status certification or COVID-passports) as a condition for entry. For future large scale events, event organisers will need to determine their own entry requirements and policies for use of COVID-status certifications. The guidance is also apply to hospitality venues such as pubs, nightclubs and restaurants.\\n\\nThe new government guidance, which applies to England only, provides that from 19 July:\\n\\nthe use of COVID-status certification as a condition of entry for visitors to any setting will not be mandated \\u2013 event organisers and venues will be free to determine their own rules;\\n\\n'Essential settings should not use certification, but others can decide to use it at their own discretion in compliance with legal obligations' \\u2013 accordingly event organisers and venues may choose to insist upon COVID-status certification as a condition of entry. The guidance elaborates that 'Essential settings and those that have been able to stay open throughout the pandemic should not use certification';\\n\\nFor venues which choose to require COVID-status certification, the government has suggested using the NHS COVID Pass system (NHS COVID Pass for events and travel - NHS (www.nhs.uk)), which provides users with digital and paper routes to a 'Pass' if they meet one of the following criteria:\\n\\n2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in England (provided the second dose was at least 2 weeks prior)\\n\\nNegative PCR test or rapid lateral flow test within the past 48 hours\\n\\nPositive PCR test within the past 6 months\\n\\nWhilst the NHS COVID Pass system will provide a standardised and convenient way to verify COVID-status certification, operators will also be required to accept other forms of proof of status, e.g. text results of tests and paper letters.\\n\\nFollowing this guidance, venue owners and operators will need to consider:\\n\\nWhether they wish to impose any COVID-status certification requirements as a condition for entry; Processes for implementing the NHS COVID PASS system and how to cater for the needs of customers that do not have access to smartphones or other digital means; How to communicate policies and requirements to customers; Whether ticket / venue entry terms and conditions require updating to reflect any new entry policy; and Refund policies for ticket holders who no longer wish to attend or are unable to attend due to their COVID-status certification.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Ambulance staff carry the body of a COVID-19 victim in India. /AFP Ambulance staff carry the body of a COVID-19 victim in India. /AFP Editor's note: Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, political analyst and freelance reporter. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. According to data published by Johns Hopkins University on July 7, the global death toll attributed to COVID-19 had risen past 4 million. While some countries, like the United States and those in Europe, are doing far better than before thanks to their privilege in being able to secure enough vaccine doses for their populations, many countries in the Global South are still struggling.Global North countries are continuing in their unlocking plans pretty much unabated for the most part thanks to their high rate of vaccination, which, even though there are COVID-19 flare-ups across some regions, there is nowhere near the same strain on hospitals. On the upside, it means that current vaccines work and people in these parts of the world are transitioning into living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease; something which experts have long suggested was the eventual outcome of the pandemic.On the other hand, the global media and public have largely become desensitized to the staggering death toll that is continuing around the world and have lost perspective. It's true that the daily global death figure now is significantly less than the peak in January (7,900 now versus more than 14,700 at that time), but it is still 57 percent higher than the same time last year.At the same time, the 1 million death mark was reached on September 29, 2020. After that, it took around 115 days to reach 2 million, 88 days to pass 3 million, and 89 days to reach 4 million. It means that there have been far more deaths in 2021 from COVID-19 than there were in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.This is only according to official numbers. Since deaths are being driven by so-called developing countries, it's likely that they are significantly underreported and the death toll in reality is far higher. Experts believe this is the case even in so-called developed countries like the United States, which alone accounts for 15 percent of the official global death toll.This still-dire situation around the world in regards to the pandemic highlights the reality of global inequality, namely, the chasm between the Global North and Global South. While the Global North is unlocking, many parts of the Global South remain vaccine deserts untouched by the ray of hope that is inoculation against the virus. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic is by definition a global issue, allowing the Global South to go empty-handed in the final stages of this battle will inevitably backfire. Graves of whose who passed away due to the coronavirus disease are pictured at the Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus, Brazil, May 20, 2021. /Reuters Graves of whose who passed away due to the coronavirus disease are pictured at the Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus, Brazil, May 20, 2021. /Reuters As more transmissible and potentially more virulent variants of COVID-19 emerge thanks to a wide variety of vectors resulting from this vaccine inequality, these variants, which could evade an immune response, will certainly find their way into the Global North. By this logic, it is quite literally in these countries' interests to help the Global South push ahead with their vaccine drives.To be sure, this does not just mean donating vaccines from their own stockpiles as the G7 countries have already pledged. Their 1 billion pledged doses would still be woefully inadequate to meet the demand of the Global South, where most of the world's nearly 8 billion inhabitants reside.Global North countries should ramp up their vaccine production, halt unilateral sanctions that threaten supply chains in the case of the United States,\\u00a0and end the disinformation campaigns against successful vaccines produced in places like Russia, China or Cuba.Rich countries are beginning to wind down their fight against COVID-19, which is good for them, but they should not forget that the pandemic is a global issue. They have not only a moral imperative, but also a very real self-interest at stake, in furthering the global vaccine drive, especially in the Global South.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at opinions@cgtn.com.)\",\n",

Vulnerable communities most years in Fiji deal with the aftermath of cyclones and flooding desperately needing support to rebuild their homes and replace chattels. Fiji has made great strides in recent years 'building back better' following these events. Covid is different as the destruction has a greater impact on livelihoods due to loss of jobs and income as borders are closed to their main income earner tourism. Health resources are stretched leaving people in rural areas very little in the way of support. Large numbers of the most vulnerable often live in informal settlements and squatter villages. One of Rotary's partners in Fiji continues to reach out to those who have no option but to live in overcrowded accommodation including dwellings often made from cardboard, wood, corrugated iron, plastic sheeting and metal from oil drums etc. with lack of sanitation, clean drinking water and open sewers. Pollution and disease is not uncommon. A number of New Zealand based International NGO's are supporting Fiji along with Rotary. Rotary's response is at the grassroots level directly to identified communities who have not received support from other agencies.

      "      \"summary\": \"Global financial uncertainty has increased the amount of physical currency in circulation, and tamper evident technology keeps it is safe hands MELBOURNE, VIC, AUSTRALIA, July 9, 2021 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Floods, Bushfires, and Cash One wouldn't think that the value of bank notes would have increased significantly since the start of Covid-19 - but the RBA disagrees. The Covid-19 Pandemic had a profound effect on the world economy and on how businesses operated in order to survive. One could be forgiven for believing that the value of currency in circulation - travelling through our economy in money bags would have plummeted considerably during this period (due to the requirement for hygienic cashless transactions). However, the truth is that the reverse occurred. According to the RBA (Australia's reserve bank), the arrival of Covid-19 significantly increased the value of banknotes in circulation. This is similar with previous moments of economic insecurity, when people sought to accumulate cash as a precautionary store of wealth (storing currency in secure storage bags) . This trend is not unique to Australia; it has been observed in a number of other nations as well, including Japan, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, and New Zealand.\\u00a0 Feel free to read the report here https://www.acma.gov.au/publications/2020-04/report/impacts-2019-20-bushfires-telecommunications-network Digital technology does not leverage physical cash assets that can be protected using tamper evident packaging solutions. Cash's utility as a preventive store of wealth is not confined to pandemics on a global scale. Recent flooding events in New South Wales, which impacted a range of critical services, including the region's electricity infrastructure, demonstrated another significant advantage of cash: it is not leveraged by digital technology. As Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe put it, \\\"cash does not require the internet to be up, electricity to be working and the banks' systems to be operational.\\\" This failsafe is critical in an age when our crucial systems are getting more technologically advanced through the use of digital processes. Obviously, this requirement is not limited to flooding, but applies to any occurrence that has an effect on our digital systems. The bushfires of 2019-2020, which consumed more than 46 million acres and destroyed at least 3,500 homes, also had a significant impact on the country's digital networks. The Australian Communications and Media Authority stated the following about our telecommunications and internet infrastructure: (can be found here https://www.govcms.gov.au/customers/australian-comunications-and-media-authority ) During the evaluation period, 1,390 facilities were impacted by bushfires, either directly or indirectly. 51% of all afflicted facilities suffered outages lasting four hours or more during the review period, while 26% experienced outages lasting less than four hours. The average duration of outages was 3.5 days, while the median duration was 1.6 days. ACMA \\u2014 The 2019-20 bushfires' impact on the telecommunications network. Covid-19 has ingrained and heightened dread of the unknown. Returning to our initial discussion of cash holdings and Covid-19, the RBA's study reflected the same concern about digitally leveraged systems potentially dictating behavior during a pandemic. Cash holdings exceeded cash deposits in 2020, and the RBA's report indicates that, in addition to the generalised uncertainty associated with Covid-19, this particular anxiety was due to the possibility of disrupted electronic payment systems. This was demonstrated by the fact that cash withdrawals increased in March 2020 as the stormy year began to take shape. While reality looked a little different, with businesses declining cash as a safeguard for their employees and digital systems remaining operational, the anxiety was justified. There is widespread agreement that Covid-19 has instilled an underlying sense of insecurity in the global population. If someone had told us at Christmas in 2019 that we would be experiencing a catastrophic disruption to life as we know it for the following 12 months (and, when all is said and done, perhaps for the next 2-3 years), we would have laughed. Flights would be grounded, masks would be required, and residents could only leave the house for a brief period to perform errands or purchase food - we would have dismissed them as neurotic \\u2013 Nonetheless, here we are. This catastrophe will leave psychological wounds on the globe as a whole, even as the environment continues to deteriorate. When you combine the now-ingrained and heightened fear of the unknown with the possibility that future calamities may be natural in nature, destroying the physical infrastructure required for our digital systems, the concept of currency is likely to feel more secure than ever. All of this means that, in an age of technological innovation and reliance on digital systems, currency remains a stable and critical component of our economic architecture. As vaccines are distributed globally and the sun slowly rises on a post-covid world, we must remember this period as a lesson in economic insecurity... We must remember that we require ways in which we must prepare for the unexpected.Will Paton RollsPack Pty Ltd +61 3 9588 0055 email us here Visit us on social media: Facebook LinkedIn You just read: EIN Presswire's priority is source transparency.

      "      \"summary\": \"JULY 9, 2021 Updated 4 hours ago Podcast: The Detail While New Zealand and the Cook Islands are bubbling away, the Covid situation in what used to be our biggest Pacific tourism destination, Fiji, is horrifying - and out of control.\\u00a0 Fiji's Covid crisis gets worse by the day, but thousands of people are so desperate for food they risk their lives by crowding into buses without masks to get to shops and hospitals. The country, with a population of more than 900,000, had avoided Covid in the community for the first year of the pandemic. But since an outbreak in April after a quarantine breach, 7870 cases have been recorded with 40 deaths. That figure is already outdated as the numbers rise daily. \\\"We expect the situation to get far, far, far worse,\\\" says Sashi Kiran, founder of FRIEND, the Foundation for Rural Integrated Enterprises and Development. \\\"We're just mopping the floor, feeding the people, organising the medicines, trying to get people into livelihoods because we're not turning the tap off, we're not halting the virus.\\\" Today, The Detail talks to Kiran in Fiji about the poorest families on the brink of disaster because they have no jobs and no food. Up to 30,000 people have applied to FRIEND for help and every week it is getting food and medicines to 1300 families. They are low-income earners, from the ice cream seller to the juice maker and the wheelbarrow boy. They have no savings, they've been surviving more than two months with no income, and they have no national social protection. Many live in crowded squatter settlements and they are also the most vulnerable to Covid. Recently the government made a one-off $50 payment per family but Kiran says it is not enough. \\\"It barely gets you food, and then there's fuel, and then medicines. \\\"And each time there is a social protection like the $50, people line up to get the (money) and each time that happens we have thousands of people getting exposed on a daily basis.\\\" Kiran says supermarkets have become Covid hotspots and the government needs to get food trucks and caravans out to people to stop them going into towns. Before Covid struck, FRIEND was helping low-income families set up small farming and food production enterprises. Now most of its work is in Covid disaster assistance. She wants the government to change its message so that it reaches people who are most vulnerable. \\\"For example, any squatter family or any person in a village and in Nadi in particular where people were normally renting, have moved into family homes because they can't afford rent and bills. So a house may have 10 to 15 people maybe with one toilet facility. How do you avoid contact in a family like that?\\\" RNZ Pacific reporter Christine Rovoi explains to The Detail the outbreak started when two people arrived with the Delta variant from India. A soldier providing security at a quarantine facility caught the virus and was isolated but he breached protocol when he had contact with a maid. The maid and other soldiers took the virus into the community and to a funeral attended by 500 people from many parts of the country. Rovoi says the government was overconfident with its response and only locked down part of the main island, Viti Levu. \\\"I think it was a bit of being too confident about them being able to maintain such a good record. They got too cocky in a way.\\\" The response and the messaging has caused confusion, anger and anxiety, says Rovoi, and it's exacerbated by the economic crisis. \\\"To be honest, the government doesn't have any money.\\\" Late last month New Zealand announced $10 million for Fiji Covid response operations and organisations working with vulnerable households. New Zealand medical specialists are already there and others are being canvassed about doing a stint there. The government has also sent equipment including $820,000 worth of PPE gear. New Zealand is also funding the vaccination of 250,000\\u00a0people in Fiji with AstraZeneca. Sashi Kiran says her organisation and other NGOs are trying to get container loads of hospital beds, bedding and medical equipment. People who wish to donate can contact Kiran at FRIENDfiji.com.

      "      \"summary\": \"By Paula Martins, in COVID-19, News \\u00b7 09-07-2021 01:00:00 \\u00b7 0 Comments This information has been circulating on blogspots through the internet claiming that from January 2020 to April 2021 only 152 people really died of Covid-19 - instead of the 17,000 people, which are the numbers confirmed by the Directorate General of Health (DGS). This would mean that the other cases would be from people who, although tested positive for Covid-19, could have died from any other reason. However, this is completely out of context. After reading all the Lisbon court ruling (https://andre-dias.net/wp-content/uploads/Fwd-Sentenca.pdf), and analysing it very carefully, we found out that there are missing points that make all the difference. The number of 152 deaths of Covid-19, presented in the judgment, is not fake, but it is based on a wrong premise \\u2013 that all death certificates are issued by doctors who work for the Prosecutor's office (MP), because it's about these death certificates issued by doctors working in the MP that the judgment writes about. However, these doctors are not the only ones who are allowed to issue death certificates. On the contrary, normally, in case of death, the patient usually was already being followed by a doctor and it is this same professional that issues the death certificate. The MP is only called when there is something indicating a death caused by a criminal act. If the person dies at home, the doctor, who was following the patient, is called to go to that house and issue the death certificate at the location. On the other hand, if someone dies in the hospital, the hospital's doctors themselves issued that certificate. In both cases, normal doctors don't need the public prosecutor's doctors to fulfill their mission. In most cases, death has a natural cause and is a result of a diagnosed disease that evolves or worsens, of identified pathological antecedents. In these cases, the intervention of the MP is very rare, which explains the low number of death certificates issued by the MP related to Covid-19. Therefore, it does not seem strange that in a universe of 17,000 deaths by Covid-19, only 152 were certified by the doctors of the MP, as apparently people were already being followed and nothing pointed to the possibility of death due to a crime that justifies the intervention of the MP. The rule of the Administrative Court of Lisbon, in which this information comes from, began from a dispute due to the right to access to administrative information.\",\n",

The matches are against Taranaki Mountainairs on Saturday and Manawatu Jets next Thursday, both matches tipping-off at 7.30pm.The Hawks are warmly favoured to win both encounters, with the Mountainairs at the bottom of the 10-team ladder, four points in arrears of the ninth-placed Jets. They beat the Mountainairs 90-87 in New Plymouth on May 20 and the Jets by 28 points in Palmerston North a month later.The playoffs will be in Porirua on July 22-23, with the Wellington Saints (12-2 with Saturday and Sunday matches this weekend), the major hurdle between the Hawks and the franchise's first NBL crown since 2006.Chairman Keith Price says crowd numbers for the seven home matches to date have been good \\u2013 \\\"up around 1400-1500\\\" - and is hoping for more as the side plays its last two matches at home. The capacity is over 2000.A star in all the home games has been mascot Hawky, mainly off-court, apart from a moment or two of exuberance which landed the club a $200 fine a fortnight ago.There's been huge support ever since for the sideline ace, and the man behind the image \\u2013 Eleazer Spooner, a former Karamu High School basketball most valuable player who now also performs with a Hastings dance troupe.Most NBL sides have mascots but Price reckons Hawky is the best, with few aware of the ordeal going on under the suit.Picking the suit up from the drycleaner on Friday, Price said: \\\"It gets pretty hot under there, by the time the game ends he's probably spent two hours in there.\\\"\",\n",

It's a decision I didn't make lightly. It's been my dream to represent Australia at the Olympics and I know I may never get that opportunity again. But I also know myself. The thought of playing in front of empty stadiums just doesn't sit right with me. It never has. I also wouldn't want to take an opportunity away from a healthy Aussie athlete ready to represent the country. I will also take all the time I need to get my body right. Good luck to all the Aussies competing and I'll see you back on the court real soon.\\\"Olympics. pic.twitter.com/ydj1V7jh2t\\u2014 Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) July 8, 2021\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"All Black Codie Taylor joins us in the studio ahead of his game against Fiji this weekend. Video / NZ Herald Fans will be banned from Tokyo-area stadiums and arenas when the Olympics begin in two weeks, the city's governor said Thursday after meeting with organisers of the pandemic-postponed games.That means the Olympics will be a largely TV-only event, after the Japanese government put the capital under a Covid-19 state of emergency because of rising new infections and the highly contagious Delta variant.The declaration was made by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, and the spectator ban was agreed to by Japanese Olympic organisers, the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, and the metropolitan government of Tokyo.It's a serious blow for Japanese taxpayers and local organisers of the games, which had already been postponed from 2020 by Covid-19. Hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket revenue will be lost, and that must be made up by the government. Fans have also endured months of uncertainty about whether the Olympics will go ahead.\\\"Many people were looking forward to watching the games at the venues, but I would like everyone to fully enjoy watching the games on TV at home,\\\" Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said after the meeting. \\\"It's gut-wrenching because many people looked forward to watching at the venues.\\\"Fans from abroad were banned months ago, and the new measures will mean no spectators in stadiums and arenas around Tokyo \\u2014 both indoor and outdoor venues.Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. Photo / APThe state of emergency begins July 12 and runs through August 22. The Olympics, which open July 23 and run through August 8, fall entirely under the emergency period, while the Paralympics open August 24.\\\"Taking into consideration the impact of the Delta strain, and in order to prevent the resurgence of infections from spreading across the country, we need to step up virus-prevention measures,\\\" Suga said.In principle, the July 23 opening ceremony at the new $1.4 billion National Stadium will be without paying fans, although some dignitaries, sponsors, IOC officials and others will be allowed to attend.\\\"We will have to review the situation about the dignitaries and stakeholders,\\\" organising committee President Seiko Hashimoto said of the opening ceremony.\\\"No fans was a very difficult decision.\\\"Hashimoto acknowledged some regrets, particularly about the decision coming so late.\\\"We had no choice but to arrive at the no-spectator decision,\\\" she said. \\\"We postponed and postponed, one after another. I have done some soul-searching about that.\\\"The emergency declaration made for a rude arrival for IOC President Thomas Bach, who landed Thursday in Tokyo for the games. He attended the virtual meeting on fans from his five-star hotel for IOC officials where he was self-isolating for three days.\\\"What can I say? Finally we are here,\\\" Bach said, sounding upbeat as he opened the late night meeting that ended close to midnight. \\\"I have been longing for this day for more than one year.\\\"Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the organising committee, said many sponsors, federation officials and others would be considered to be \\\"organisers\\\" and thus would be allowed to attend venues. He said some might occupy public seating, but he said he did not know \\\"the numerical details.\\\"Tokyo Olympics Minister Tamayo Marukawa. Photo / APOrganisers had expected to generate about $800 million in ticket sales. Any shortfall \\u2014 and it could be almost the entire amount \\u2014 will have to be made up by Japanese government entities.Japan is officially spending $15.4 billion on the Olympics, and several government audits say it's much larger. All but $6.7 billion is public money.Two weeks ago, organisers and the IOC allowed venues to be filled to 50% of capacity, with crowds not to exceed 10,000. The state of emergency forced the late turnaround, which was always an option if infections got worse.On Thursday, Tokyo reported 896 new cases, up from 673 a week earlier. It's the 19th straight day that cases have topped the mark set seven days prior. New cases on Wednesday hit 920, the highest total since 1,010 were reported on May 13.The main focus of the emergency is a request for bars, restaurants and karaoke parlours serving alcohol to close. A ban on serving alcohol is a key step to tone down Olympics-related festivities and keep people from drinking and partying. Tokyo residents are expected to face requests to stay home and watch the games on TV.\\\"How to stop people enjoying the Olympics from going out for drinks is the main issue,\\\" Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said.People wearing face masks walk past the Olympics Rings statue in Tokyo. Photo / APThe rise in infections also has forced the Tokyo city government to pull the Olympic torch relay off the streets, allowing it only on remote islands off the capital's coast.\\\"The infections are in their expansion phase and everyone in this country must firmly understand the seriousness of it,\\\" said Dr Shigeru Omi, a top government medical adviser.He urged authorities to take tough measures quickly ahead of the Olympics, with summer vacations approaching.Omi has repeatedly called for a spectator ban, calling it \\\"abnormal\\\" to stage an Olympics during a pandemic.A government Covid-19 advisory panel on Wednesday expressed concerns about the resurgence of infections.\\\"Two-thirds of the infections in the capital region are from Tokyo, and our concern is the spread of the infections to neighboring areas,\\\" said Ryuji Wakita, director-general of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.The Olympics are pushing ahead against most medical advice, partially because the postponement stalled the IOC's income flow. It gets almost 75 per cent from selling broadcast rights, and estimates suggest it would lose $3 billion to $4 billion if the Olympics were canceled altogether.About 11,000 Olympians and 4400 Paralympians are expected to enter Japan, along with tens of thousands of officials, judges, administrators, sponsors, broadcasters and media. The IOC says more than 80 per cent of Olympic Village residents will be vaccinated.Nationwide, Japan has had about 810,000 cases and nearly 14,900 deaths. Only 15 per cent of Japanese are fully vaccinated, still low compared with 47.4 per cent in the United States and almost 50 per cent in Britain.\",\n",

The Group 1 520m winner has drawn to serve a repeat dose from her handy two-trap draw.Bigtime Cooper owns the firepower to not only match her, but also to cross her during the rush into the first turn. The winner of $135,519 was impeded during the initial rush for positions last week which saw him whacking away for his three-length third.Splitting the above pair last Friday was Big Time Harley who was huge when he closed to within a 1.25 length margin from Jilliby Litsa. He was mounting a sustained finish when he copped a checked entering the final turn.Last Friday's 17.60s 305m winner Big Time Ziggy has been allocated the one-trap for the main 305m sprint (race 7). Cole produced her to lead all the way and her draw provides her with repeat claims.Kennelmate Big Time Fuzz continues to deliver her range of competitive sprints. She chased home Big Time Ziggy for her 2.25 length second last Friday, then she did likewise when finishing a half-length runner-up to race rival Big Time Gwyn in Monday's Palmerston North 410m dash. Expect a similar bold effort again.Yes, Big Time Gwyn held on gamely for her on-the-pace 23.38s Monday 410 win. She tends to mix her sprints at this venue however her podium claims cannot be lightly dismissed here.And a similar comment can be made for Big Time Fairy who landed her C3/4 meet best 17.58s 305m win last week. She adds to the puzzle that this field presents.Pina Colada was also a C3/4 305m winner last week when she led throughout for her 17.71s win. She can spice up the race combos from her trap-eight draw for her conditioners Jake and Daze Bell.\",\n",

We'll give them as much chance as we can,\\\" said coach Carl Gibson.After having to revert to Golden Oldies scrums when both hookers and a prop were injured last Saturday, Kaierau get representative player Joe Edwards back, while Jack van Bussel's banged-up leg has recovered enough.Having played his first Premier game since 2015, Josh Edwards remains in the halfback frame if Cameron Davies can't play, while Ethan Robinson's hurt back continues to be monitored.\\\"[The results] go back to zero and we'll go out as a proud club and leave nothing to wonder.\\\"While Joe Edwards and Robinson have shared the captaincy this season, Gibson may keep the role with indomitable lock Josh Lane, who took charge last weekend.\\\"He leads by example, by what he does, which is the best way.\\\"The coach admits with player positions being so up in the air, it is difficult to plan their structure and attacking lines.\\\"We just go back to Ace \\u2013 he's the key man there, he'll just do what he always does.\\\"At 39 years old, club legend Ace Malo has continued to soldier on, with his son Ezra having joined him in the team this year.Able to play anywhere from halfback to fullback, he has been Kaierau's guiding light for a decade, including some very lean years, and is respected by all clubs.\\\"He's about playing as good as anyone in that team, I thought he was their best player last week,\\\" said Taihape coach Tom Wells.Wells had the luxury last Saturday to rest his first five Dane Whale, so he could be fully ready to rejoin the starting XV alongside brothers Luke and Ben, and all three Hay-Horton siblings in Hadlee, Slade and Peter-Travis.Wells has touted prop Hadlee Hay-Horton and utility back Tyler Rogers-Holden as probably his two best players every week, while it is Ben Whale who will receive the Premier MVP award, following an outstanding season at No 8 since coming home from England.\\\"It's good reward for him, he'll be pumped for that.\\\"Taihape are hosting only their second home Premier semifinal, and with a good crowd expected, Wells will want his in-form side to deliver the goods.\\\"Just a chance for us to put on a display. Hopefully reward them for travelling with us, since 2016 basically.\\\"\",\n",

(Front) Kaitlin Revell (Wellington), Phoebe Collier (Taihape), Polly Wenlock (Porirua), Alice Fahey (Wellington).River observers over last weekend may have noticed a larger than usual contingent of young female rowers training from the Aramoho Whanganui Rowing Club boat house.A squad of New Zealand Women's Under 21 and Junior (Under 19) scullers ventured onto the placid waters at Aramoho under designated lead coaches Nick Barton and Fiona Bourke.Barton, now based at Lake Kar\\u0101piro, as the lead coach of the NZ Junior Rowing Programme, is no stranger to Whanganui, having attended Whanganui Collegiate School in the mid 1990s and was a member of the first VIII for two years. He has built an impressive rowing coaching background at school, university, and with NZ Junior Women's crews.Bourke, born and raised in Takapau, did not commence rowing until she attended Otago University. She progressed rapidly, representing New Zealand in various crews from 2010, culminating in winning the gold medal at the World Championships in 2014 with Zoe Stephenson in the women's double sculls.Bourke commented that her international rowing career was led by Dick Tonks and while she had previously raced on the Whanganui River, it was great to be coaching on the same water that Dick had learned and applied his outstanding skills.The Whanganui River is rapidly becoming known as a nursery for producing many of New Zealand's elite crews over many years.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"The wrap\\n\\nJust when you thought it was safe to back into the water! No, nothing has been resolved; the waters are as murky as ever. The six is no closer to being resolved. Harbour finally awoke with the thought it might miss the six and put an under strength GI side to the sword. Varsity got up late over Southern to take the crucial points and leave Southern on the knife edge. Taieri destroyed the previously high flying MAQ's (Kaik) by 40 to confirm a spot in the six with GI. Dunedin did enough to get the five points off an under strength Zingers outfit, but with the bye this week its fate is not in its own hands.\\n\\nSo what does it all mean? GI and Taieri are in and Kaik is more or less there, as Zingari has only one fit front rower currently and is trying to arrange 'loan' players to come in so it can front this weekend. Its injury toll was huge and it lost another four last Saturday against the Sharks. Southern has to beat AU tomorrow to make it but the word is Coltman and Nareki are fronting for the Ponies, so touch and go. Harbour has to beat Taieri at the Eelpit to make it and that is no easy feat. Varsity has to get a point out of the GI game to confirm a spot. Dunedin can just wonder. So GI, Taieri and Kaik are in the other three too close to call. You can guarantee one team is going to be bitterly disappointed. What a comp!\\n\\nRipleys Believe it or Not\\n\\nThis is a true story. One of the proprietors of the best known pub in Kaikorai Valley must have had a large night in the last couple of weeks because he tried dialling a taxi on the 'sky remote' and couldn't believe it when the taxi didn't arrive \\u2013 I kid you not. Call in and mention it when you're passing.\\n\\nSpeaking of vehicles. One of our sales staff at the ODT took a blue company station wagon to see a client the other day. Upon coming out of the meeting she pushed the 'key clicker' and jumped into a car and off to the next meeting. She couldn't understand why she had to adjust the seat and radio. After the next meeting she finally noticed she was driving a grey station wagon. I kid you not, true story.\\n\\nThe Claytons tour\\n\\nSo NZRU picked a NZ Colts team to go to Aussie and they assembled a couple of weeks ago to prepare. In the interim, Covid struck again, so the tour was gone. Instead of sending the players home to their clubs to hopefully play finals footy they hastily arranged games against a Tasman XV and the Cook Islands \\u2013 really? The NZRU is really only paying lip service to grassroots rugby \\u2014 the rest is platitudes!\\n\\nYet more strain on club resources\\n\\nSo the Otago side has been named and no real surprises apart from Charles Elton not being named, but I hear he could be brought in. To make it even harder on clubs, Southland has been sniffing round in Mackintoshes and dark glasses. Tufui and Misiloi from Harbour are gone, Grayson Knapp from Kaik has disappeared and rumour has it the GI centre may also have signed. It's hard work running a club, let me assure you.\\n\\nCountry rugby\\n\\nIn the North it's too confusing, so I'll wait till they have a real final \\u2014 they are in preliminary mode, apparently. In Central, Upper Clutha takes on the Cromwell Goats in the final in old Cromwell town. The Goats haven't been beaten forever, so they should prevail. As an aside, I was talking to 'PL' Anderson (guest selector this week) and he was telling me he and Clarkey \\u2014 both well into their 80s \\u2014 have been going to rugby together since they were 5 years old, first as players, then administrators and now spectators \\u2014 great work lads and hopefully many more. I'm in South Otago tomorrow covering Clutha Valley v Heriot for Rugby Chat \\u2014 come up and say gidday if you are heading along. This is the last round, with the finalists already decided \\u2014 they're just working on the order.\\n\\nOther bits\\n\\nJake Fowler, from GI, plays his 50th game this weekend \\u2013 good on ya mate. The word from the High Veldt is the MAQs are in crisis mode with secret meetings happening in every changing room \\u2013 surely not!\\n\\nThis weekend\\n\\nDecimated Jeff Hollaway last weekend \\u2014 simply no challenge. On to Gareth Weatherston from GI, so at least a contest. Kaik (13+) will easily account for Zingers if the game gets played. AU (12-), strengthened, might just tip up the Magpies at Bog Bathgate. GI (12-), with some players back, do enough at the Toolbox to beat Varsity, just. The Eels (12-) are hitting their straps and there is no love lost between them and Harbour. Eels by a fin.\\n\\nGod I'm good in Country and got the perfect 60 last week, so 'Mr Ibby' had no chance. On to 'PL' Anderson from Upper Clutha, so I remain unbeaten. The Goats will beat Upper Clutha 15-12 \\u2014 take it to the bank.\\n\\npaul.dwyer@alliedpress.co.nz\",\n",

Photo / PhotosportThe formation of an Auckland racing super club is now a reality after Auckland Racing Club members voted yes to a merger with Counties in a move which will rejuvenate the thoroughbred racing industry.Members of the ARC club voted heavily for the merger at their special general meeting at Ellerslie last night, two days after Counties Racing Club members had done the same.Only two of the 120-130 members present at Ellerslie voted against the amalgamation.The two clubs will now merge to form Auckland Thoroughbred Racing Incorporated (ATRI) which will commence on August 1, the start of the new racing season.After that, all meetings held by at Ellerslie and Pukekohe Park will be run by the new club, which now needs to be registered and then the historic move is all but complete.\\\"It is an incredibly exciting time that a lot of people in both clubs have worked hard to make a reality,\\\" ARC chief executive Paul Wilcox said last night. \\\"We are proud of the way our members have approached the process and then made the decision to be open to a brave new future for racing in this region. And we are thrilled at the yes vote.\\\"The new ARTI will have the time and the expertise to do what is right rather than what is needed as land parcels can be developed, leased or sold, most notably the famous Ellerslie steeplechase hill, so ATRI can establish an investment fund to maximise returns.But while that will mean jumps racing ends at Ellerslie, club bosses committed at last night's meeting to helping jumps racing, including their iconic races such as the Great Northern, to continue at another venue.Racing will continue long-term at Ellerslie and Pukekohe Park but Ellerslie will take a break, after the Cup meeting next March, to install a StrathAyr track to provide a better winter racing surface.During that time meetings will be moved to other venues including Pukekohe and Avondale, which is likely to stay in operation until 2025 and then close with the Avondale Jockey Club to remain autonomous but race predominantly at Ellerslie.The eventual pooling of the three clubs assets could see sustainable income push stakes toward an average of $100,000 per Saturday race at Ellerslie in a few years, a dream figure for most in the struggling industry.That should help keep horse people and horses in New Zealand as finally the industry will have at least one track to compete with the rich Sydney and Melbourne tracks.It will also have somewhere for New Zealand-based trainers, owners and jockeys to aspire to, with Ellerslie set to attract the best horses from around the North Island as they chase stakes double or triple what other tracks will be able to offer.While there is still work to be done, starting with the committees of the two clubs now voting on who will be on the board to initially steer ARTI through its transition into life, the light at the end of racing's dark tunnel just became much brighter.\",\n",

Photo / SuppliedChampion big race driver Anthony Butt hopes the new string to Copy That's bow can slingshot the Auckland pacer to victory in Australia's new glamour race.The A$250,000 Rising Sun at Albion Park in Brisbane has arrived on the harness racing scene with a boom, attracting the likes of Krug, Copy That, Amazing Dream and Miracle Mile runner-up Expensive Ego for its first running.\\\"It is pretty exciting, when you think this race didn't exist until now,\\\" says Butt, the Kiwi now domiciled in Victoria who has won almost every major race in Australasia.Butt is in position to judge the merits of the two key Kiwi contenders as he drove Krug to victory in the Redcliffe Derby two weeks ago and then Copy That to roar home from last in the Wondai's Mate on this track last Saturday.The vast majority of Copy That's wins have come when he was able to lead, common in age group stars as they so often dominate and secure the front, but his brilliant finish last Saturday has convinced Butt he can win even coming from the outside of the second line over 2138m tomorrow.\\\"It is not going to be easy and I'd love to have drawn better, but we can still win,\\\" says Butt.Krug is expected by many to lead from the ace but he could cop early pressure, especially from Victorian speedster Kowalski Analysis, and if they burn up too much early then a big, rugged stayer such as Expensive Ego looks certain to exploit that.\\\"If all of that happens then maybe Expensive Ego will be too good because he is a very smart horse, he was huge in both the Chariots Of Fire and Miracle Mile earlier in the year,\\\" says Butt. \\\"So, I need some luck, some tempo and a horse to follow.\\\"So strong is the Rising Sun that Amazing Dream is rated a $12 chance in Australia even though she won the Auckland Cup, beating Spankem and Copy That just six months ago.She hasn't raced since her Jewels defeat five weeks ago and while drawing barrier three, she almost certainly lacks the gate speed to lead, so could be dictated to by any moves in the race.\",\n",

He'll captain the All Blacks against Fiji. \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n\\n\\nSmith will lead the All Blacks against Fiji in Dunedin on Saturday and the question is, will the Flying Fijians pose a bigger challenge than the under strength Tongans who overcame a mountain of obstacles just to field a team last week at Mt Smart?\\nThe All Blacks coach Ian Foster has made 13 changes to his starting XV from the one that crushed Tonga and he said Smith deserves the right to captain the side against Fiji.\\n\\\"He's earned it. He's a big part of our whole leadership group, he's grown to become an outstanding preparer for a Test match and we've watched his leadership through the Highlanders and we thought he did a great job there as well, so it gives us a lot of confidence to give him that title.\\\"\\nIt will be the Highlanders star's 98th test for New Zealand and Foster said Smith has been a vital part of the All Blacks for a decade.\\nHowever the halfback almost kneecapped his own career. in 2012 he was benched ahead of a test against South Africa in Dunedin for missing a team curfew.\\nIn 2016 he was given a formal warning and stood down by New Zealand Rugby for serious misconduct after having sex with a woman in a Christchurch airport toilet before the All Blacks were due to fly to South Africa.\\nSmith has said in the past that he's learnt from those mistakes and has become a better rugby player and a better person.\\nBeauden Barrett, who starts at first-five this weekend, said Smith is the ultimate team man and a fierce competitor.\\n\\\"He's always been very energetic and that passion and desire has always been there but one thing that stands out is his internal drive is, whatever it is, it makes him tick, he's always the one out there doing the extras, he's always offering advice, he's always asking how he can get better which is inspiring.\\\"\\nBarrett's selection in place of Richie Mo'unga is one of many changes made to the All Blacks starting XV, with Jordie Barrett at fullback and David Havili at second five. There's a new front row, including the side's only debutant Ethan de Groot and a new locking duo that marks the return of Brodie Retallick. The loose forwards have all been swapped out, with Ethan Blackadder at openside.\\nBeauden Barrett has been sporting two black eyes this week and he revealed today it was Blackadder who did the damage.\\n\\\"I was warned about Ethan Blackadder when he first came into camp and found out about that pretty quick, so got to stay well clear of them at training.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto: Photosport / Andrew Cornaga\\n\\n\\nRetallick is back 18 months after last playing a test and spending a stint playing in Japan.\\n\\\"I'm a little bit nervous, to be fair,\\\" Retallick said. \\\"It's been a wee while since the 2019 World Cup, but it's been good.\\n\\\"We had the camp in Auckland, and being around the team last week preparing for a test. I am a little bit nervous, but I'm also excited to get out there and get back into the test arena, that's for sure.\\\"\\nFoster is warning his side that Fiji will be a much sterner challenge than Tonga, with their best players available.\\n\\\"A little bit of a contrast to last week. They've (Fiji) got a lot of players coming back from Europe who have been playing regularly. They've got a lot of quality players in those European competitions. They're are growing team, we saw that in 2019 during the World Cup where they really pushed Aussie and Wales I think it was. So, they can play.\\\"\\nThe Fiji born All Blacks wing Sevu Reece will start on Saturday and he revealed earlier this week that he was close to committing to his country of heritage for the 2019 World Cup, when he was contacted by then Fiji coach John McKee.\\n\\\"He gave me a call I as going to catch up with him, but we're just texting, and to be fair I was probably about 'this close' to playing for Fiji because the talent we've got here in New Zealand is just crazy.\\\"\\nWhile he's very much looking forward to sharing the field with his Fijian brothers, Reece expects the All Blacks Fijian trio of himself, prop George Bower and No.8 Hoskins Sotutu to have bullseyes on their backs.\\n\\\"I was joking to George Bower and Hoskins [Sotutu], coz those are our two other Fijians and I told them if we do get the chance to play Fiji, we'll probably be the running target around here.\\\"\\nWhile New Zealand basks in relative Covid safety, the same can't be said about Fiji, where a record 791 positive cases and three more deaths were recorded in the 24 hours before 8am Wednesday.\\nThe Fiji wing and former Crusaders star Nemani Nadolo, says they will dedicate Saturday's game to their nation as they continue to battle coronavirus.\\n\\\"We've got a lot of fuel to go out there, a lot of motivation. Our people back home in Fiji are struggling with the current epidemic.\\n\\\"Obviously we're here away from our families, the sacrifice that we've had to do to put our hands up and come and represent Fiji, so I think people don't understand the severity of what we've had to do to come here, to be quarantined.\\\"\\nIt's been 10 years since Fiji last played the All Blacks, with New Zealand winning that game 60-14.\\nSo, will fans see another one sided affair like they did last week against Tonga, or have Fiji managed to buck the trend of tier two nations and close that gap in the last decade?\",\n",

It's not the idea of it so much, more the detail.\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto: Photosport\\n\\n\\nUntil such time as the finances and infrastructure allow each team - Moana Pasifika in particular - to be truly autonomous, then the franchises will fail. Or at least be beholden to the likes of New Zealand Rugby (NZR), who have a vested interest in five other franchises.\\nBut so dismal was Tonga's 102-0 loss to the All Blacks last Saturday, that Moana Pasifika is now critical to the success of rugby in this region.\\nThe game - and by that I mean everyone associated with rugby in the South Pacific - needs there to be professional vehicles for players beyond NZR and the All Blacks.\\nFor rugby in this part of the world to flourish - and that includes in New Zealand - we need Tongan, Samoan and Fijian rugby players not to play for the All Blacks.\\nEligibility changes wouldn't hurt, but they won't sustain Pasifika rugby in the long term.\\nLetting former All Blacks play for their nation of heritage could make teams more competitive - provided they can be released by their clubs - but they won't really change anyone's fortunes.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuinn Tupaea on debut for the All Blacks in match against Tonga on 3 July. \\nPhoto: Photosport\\n\\n\\nLet's take a quick look at rugby league.\\nPlayers such as Jarome Luai and Brian To'o have been integral to the success of New South Wales in this year's State of Origin series. Both are Australian-born, but both want to play their international rugby league for Samoa.\\nThat doesn't suit everyone involved in rugby league in Australia, who believe you should only be allowed to play in State of Origin football if your intention is to appear for the Kangaroos.\\nOthers, though, recognise the changing face of the game in Australia. They realise more than 50 percent of NRL players are Pasifika and they want international rugby league to reflect that.\\nTonga are already strong, but Samoa and Fiji could be just as good. Just as importantly, Mate Ma'a Tonga have shown us that fans will follow a flourishing team.\\nThose with a view of the bigger picture realise Australia needs legitimate rivals if the international game is to rise again. If that means losing Kangaroo-eligible players to Pacific nations, then so be it.\\nOur view remains rather narrow here. We continue to stockpile rugby talent that could make Fiji, Tonga and Samoa strong, because we believe it maintains the All Blacks' pre-eminence.\\nFrankly, last Saturday's drubbing of Tonga did nothing to enhance the All Blacks' brand and nor will the anticipated thrashings of Fiji either.\\nMost of us can spot a 50-test All Black a mile off. There's just something about the way they walk and talk and look that sets them apart from your average rugby player.\\nYou assume NZR can spot those players too and yet they insist on throwing All Black caps around like confetti. We routinely pick blokes to play for New Zealand who are never going to appear more than 10 or 15 times, just so they're ineligible to play for anyone else.\\nEveryone accepts the circumstances that prevented Tonga from fielding a competitive team last week, but the biggest impediment remains the All Blacks.\\nIf you want to play professional rugby in this part of the world, then you need to declare your allegiance to New Zealand or Australia. Beyond that, any number of Pasifika players now represent Japan or England or France, because of the pathways made open to them there.\\nWe've reached a point with Samoan and Tongan and Fijian test rugby where we need to provide a different pathway; a pathway that helps those nations retain their elite players and select New Zealand and Australian-born ones too.\\nA professional Pasifika franchise - or franchises - is critical to this. Just as allowing Blues and Hurricanes and Chiefs and Highlanders and Crusaders players to represent their nation of heritage is as well.\\nAs with rugby league in Australia, there will be those who say it's not in NZR's interests to develop talent for other nations. Maybe. But you only have to look at the 102-point drubbing at Mt Smart Stadium to see why actually it is.\\nRugby league has shown us that when you give a nation such as Tonga access to their best players, they will succeed. To watch them beat New Zealand, Great Britain and Australia in recent seasons has been among the great sporting thrills of my lifetime.\\nWell, we can have this in rugby too. Perhaps to an even greater degree as well, given rugby's popularity compared to league.\\nIt's one thing for European and Japanese clubs to make it difficult for Pasifika players to appear in test rugby, but it's quite another for NZR to do the same. Particularly when rugby in New Zealand would benefit so greatly by having genuinely competitive clashes with our Pacific Island neighbours.\\nWe can't afford to wait a minute longer.\",\n",

Video / Sky SportThe football world was disgusted by a juvenile act at Wembley as England and Denmark played out a thrilling Euro 2020 semi-final.Harry Kane's goal in extra time \\u2014 scoring from the rebound after goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel saved a controversial penalty that stirred up plenty of debate \\u2014 gave England a 2-1 victory and the Three Lions will play Italy in the decider for the chance to win their first major international trophy since the 1966 World Cup.Schmeichel was Denmark's best, having an outstanding game between the posts. An incredible save to deny Raheem Sterling from close range in the first half was followed by more impressive stops as the game wore on, preventing England from getting the go-ahead goal it desperately wanted before the first 90 minutes were up.He did brilliantly to save Kane's penalty but had no chance of stopping the follow-up. Making Schmeichel's save even more remarkable is that he did it while an idiot in the crowd was trying to put him off with a laser pointer.A green mark hovered around Schmeichel's face as he stared down Kane, sparking widespread condemnation from fans watching on.Unbelievable.Someone in the crowd was pointing a laser into Schmeichel's eyes as he was trying to save the penalty Sterling dived for.Horrible look for England this.Disgraceful.#EURO2020 pic.twitter.com/LEusViVtMC\\u2014 JAKE BUCKLEY \\ud83c\\udde6\\ud83c\\uddfa (@TheMasterBucks) July 7, 2021 Former English football player turned pundit, Stan Collymore, tweeted: \\\"If anyone shone a laser pen at Schmeichel, they want banning for life.\\\"Newspaper editor Kevin McGuire wrote: \\\"CCTV everywhere so the idiot who shone a laser pen at Kasper Schmeichel during the penalty should be pictured, identified, prosecuted, jailed, shamed and banned from football for life. Dangerous idiot.\\\"Journalist Gareth Davies added: \\\"Booing the Danish national anthem. Shining a laser pen at Schmeichel as the penalty was taken. Why is that (some) England fans never miss a chance to bring shame on the country?\\\"DJ Zoe London said: \\\"Oh my god who used a laser pen on Schmeichel's eye in the penalty that's absolutely dreadful.\\\"A green mark hovered around Schmeichel's face as he stared down Kane. Photo / TwitterEngland on the cusp of greatnessGareth Southgate praised the \\\"incredible job\\\" done by his players as England ended a 55-year wait to reach a major tournament final.\\\"I'm so proud of the players,\\\" Southgate told ITV. \\\"It's an incredible occasion to be a part of \\u2014 we knew it wouldn't be straightforward, we said to the players we'll have to show our resilience and come back from some setbacks, and we've done that tonight.\\\"England conceded their first goal of the tournament when Mikkel Damsgaard drilled a free-kick past Jordan Pickford, but the hosts soon equalised as Simon Kjaer turned into his own net.\\\"I felt we would get there. I knew we would have different sorts of battles because Denmark are so underrated as a team,\\\" said Southgate.\\\"They did cause us a lot of problems, when you've waited as long as we have to get through a semi-final, the players, considering the limited international experience some of them have had, they've done an incredible job.\\\"Southgate credited Kane for keeping his nerve after having his penalty saved initially by Kasper Schmeichel.\\\"There's nobody you've rather have on it, but you're up against a great goalkeeper who he's obviously faced a lot of times \\u2014 but thankfully that's now immaterial.\\\"After falling to Croatia in extra time in the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, England made sure there was no repeat slip-up in front of almost 65,000 fans at Wembley.\\\"The most pleasing thing is that we've given our fans and our nation a fantastic night, and the journey continues on for another four days,\\\" said Southgate.\\\"To come through that sort of a night we suffered in Moscow (in the World Cup semi-final) and on a night like this we've managed to put things right.\\\"But he was quick to shift his focus to Monday morning's (NZT) final against an Italy side on a national record run of 33 matches unbeaten.\\\"We're in the final and we've got to enjoy that fact, but there's one more massive hurdle to try and conquer,\\\" Southgate said.PremiumPremiumPremiumPremium\",\n",

Video / Sky SportNot a single person in England will care but the perennial underachievers of world football have ended their major championship final drought in the most controversial of circumstances.Gareth Southgate's side will face Italy at Wembley on Monday in England's first European Championship final after a match defined by questionable refereeing decisions.In the first period of extra time, after England and Denmark finished normal time tied at 1-1, Raheem Sterling wove his way into the penalty box and went down under pressure from two defenders.England's Raheem Sterling, left, is fouled by Denmark's Mathias Jensen and a penalty is awarded. Photo /APThe referee ruled it a foul and pointed to the penalty spot, where Harry Kane had his shot blocked by Kasper Schmeichel but was first to the rebound and tucked away a game-winner that sent English fans crazy.As celebrations began, attention turned immediately to the Sterling foul, which appeared to be committed by Joakim Maehle.The reaction from some quarters was fierce.England fans celebrate outside Wembley Stadium after England qualified for the Euro 2020 final. Photo / APFormer Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also declared it \\\"no penalty\\\" and couldn't understand why VAR wasn't used.\\\"No one knows who gave away that penalty,\\\" Socceroos legend John Aloisi said on Optus Sport. \\\"Was there enough contact? I don't think there was. In my opinion, it wasn't a penalty.\\\"Defend, defend, defend, win a few cheap fouls and go through on a dodgy penalty. The most Italian team in the tournament meets Italy in the final.\\u2014 Grace Robertson \\ud83c\\udff3\\ufe0f\\u200d\\u26a7\\ufe0f (@GraceOnFootball) July 7, 2021 Well done England for reaching a first final in 55 years. Happy for Southgate who is one of football's good guys.Crushed for Denmark. A semi final of a major tournament should never be decided with such a non-existent penalty #ENGDEN\\u2014 Carlo Garganese (@carlogarganese) July 7, 2021 But Sterling said the foul on him that led to England's winning goal was a \\\"clear penalty\\\".\\\"I went into the box and he stuck his right leg out, and it touched my leg so it was a clear penalty,\\\" Sterling told ITV.Kane agreed. \\\"I thought it was a penalty,\\\" said Kane. \\\"I thought I should've had a penalty in the second half as well. It probably evened itself out over the game.\\\"Fans watch the Euro 2020 semifinal match between England and Denmark on a big screen, in Manchester, England. Photo / APSterling hailed his team's ability to recover from Mikkel Damsgaard's 30th-minute opener to keep their trophy hopes alive.\\\"It was a top performance \\u2013 we had to dig in deep after the first goal we conceded in the tournament, and we regrouped well and showed a good team spirit to come back and win the game,\\\" he said.\\\"It was difficult going behind but we knew we had to stay patient \\u2013 we knew with the legs we've got, the aggressiveness and the power we have in the team, it would be a matter of time before we broke them down.\\\"England reached their first major final since winning the 1966 World Cup, with Sterling a standout performer once more for Gareth Southgate's side at Wembley.There were some superb performances. All the back 4 were outstanding, and as for @sterling7, well, that was one of the greatest displays I've seen from a player in an @England shirt. Stunning.\\u2014 Gary Lineker \\ud83d\\udc99 (@GaryLineker) July 7, 2021 \\\"It's another step in the right direction,\\\" said Sterling.\\\"But once we're back in the dressing room it's over and we've got to focus on the weekend now. It's step-by-step and that's all we can do.\\\"As ever, England did it the hard way but by the final whistle 60,000 fans were bouncing in ecstasy, while millions watching on television across the country pinched themselves in disbelief.England fans at BOXPARK in Croydon celebrate England's second goal, scored by Harry Kane.

Video / Sky SportEngland has broken through its semifinal ceiling at major football tournaments. A title match awaits for the first time in 55 years.Harry Kane converted the rebound after his initial penalty was saved in the 104th minute to give England a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Denmark in extra time in the European Championship semifinals today at Wembley Stadium.England will return to its national football stadium on Monday NZT to play Italy and will be competing in its first final since the 1966 World Cup. That remains England's only international title.In the intervening 55 years, the English have lost in the semifinals four times in either the World Cup or the European Championship. For that reason, this will go down as one of the most significant victories in English football history, and the celebrations demonstrated just that.Kane led the jubilant England fans in a crowd of more than 60,000 \\u2014 the biggest gathering for a sporting event in Britain since the coronavirus outbreak nearly 16 months ago \\u2014 in a rendition of \\\"Sweet Caroline.\\\" The players and management walked around the perimeter of the field, waving to fans and then their loved ones. England coach Gareth Southgate was serenaded with a song, and he would have appreciated this win more than anyone.Two of those semifinals losses \\u2014 in 1990 and 1996 \\u2014 were decided via a penalty shootout, with Southgate missing a crucial kick in one of them against Germany. And a shootout looked like where England and Denmark were headed until Raheem Sterling wriggled into the area down the right, cut inside and fell under the challenge Mattias Jensen.The contact looked minimal, and a video review was needed.England's Harry Kane, bottom, celebrates with his teammates after scoring his side's second goal. Photo / APDenmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel guessed the right way to block Kane's penalty, but the England captain reacted quickly and put the ball into the net from six yards out.Denmark's players, whose emotionally charged run to the semifinals was powered by a resolve to win the title for Christian Eriksen after his collapse on the field during the group stage, were almost on their knees by that point.And Danish hopes of an equaliser were damaged by having to play with only 10 men for the second half of extra time after Jensen was forced off injured. Denmark had already used up its six substitutes by then.England showed another side by rallying for victory after conceding a goal for the first time at Euro 2020 when Mikkel Damsgaard scored with a free kick in the 30th.Denmark's Mikkel Damsgaard, second right, celebrates after scoring his side's opening goal against England. Photo / APIt was a shot that Eriksen \\u2014 Denmark's captain who is recovering at home after suffering cardiac arrest and collapsing on the field against Finland on June 12 \\u2014 would have been proud of as his replacement in the team whipped the ball over the defensive wall and into the top corner.At that stage, Denmark was playing the better football, with its pressing and slick passing in midfield causing England problems and sparking concern among the previously boisterous home fans.Denmark wasn't ahead for long, though.Moments after Sterling was denied from point-blank range by Kasper Schmeichel, Bukayo Saka was sent free down the right by Kane's pass and the winger's low cross was bundled into the net by Denmark defender Simon Kjaer in the 39th, under pressure from Sterling. It was the 11th own-goal of Euro 2020.The second half saw England control the game, helped by the introduction of substitute Jack Grealish and the injury-enforced departure of Denmark defender Andreas Christensen.Schmeichel had to be alert to save Harry Maguire's header and Mason Mount's curling shot and the addition of six minutes of stoppage only increased the tension, with Denmark's tired players now largely retreating deeper into their own half.Unbelievable. Finally after all these years. So bloody wonderful.\\u2014 Gary Lineker \\ud83d\\udc99 (@GaryLineker) July 7, 2021 \\ud83c\\udff4\\udb40\\udc67\\udb40\\udc62\\udb40\\udc65\\udb40\\udc6e\\udb40\\udc67\\udb40\\udc7f Making history \\u2705 \\ud83c\\udff4\\udb40\\udc67\\udb40\\udc62\\udb40\\udc65\\udb40\\udc6e\\udb40\\udc67\\udb40\\udc7f National heroes \\u2705#EURO2020 | #ENG pic.twitter.com/JdrZPOba4g\\u2014 UEFA EURO 2020 (@EURO2020) July 7, 2021 - AP\",\n",

We'd had extra time in one of our matches prior to that, we'd had a very consistent team, so we are in a slightly different place in terms of the depth and strength of the squad now.\\\"In 2019, in the new UEFA competition, Southgate cited the disruption caused by Liverpool and Tottenham contesting the Champions League final just before the Nations League mini-tournament.\\\"We made errors through fatigue in extra time,\\\" Southgate said. \\\"So they were two different experiences but it's given us the understanding of preparing for those big matches and what they feel like. And I think that's part of a journey sometimes teams have to go through.\\\"At least England has avoided extra time in its five matches so far at Euro 2020. And also has not conceded a goal.\\\"We've never been to a final (as this group), so the pressure is what you choose it to be,\\\" Southgate said. \\\"I think it is a motivating thing, it is a challenge for us.\\\"If we were a country that had won five titles and had to match what had gone before I might feel differently, but we are not. Denmark have won it (in 1992), so maybe there is more pressure on Denmark to replicate that. But it is not the way we are viewing the game. We know it is about performing on the day.\\\"\",\n",

Photo / APAll the action between the British and Irish Lions and the Sharks.\\u200cThe British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa was in danger of unraveling Wednesday as the Lions confirmed a COVID-19 case among their management team barely an hour after the Springboks canceled their second warmup test against Georgia because of virus outbreaks in both those squads.The developments underlined fears raised months ago that the Lions tour would coincide with a winter surge in coronavirus infections in South Africa, which is Africa's worst-affected country. The Johannesburg region where the Lions and Springboks are currently based for the first half of the tour has been especially hard-hit by the new wave of cases.One Lions tour game this weekend against the Bulls in Pretoria had already been postponed because of yet another outbreak, this one in the Bulls team. Now, the Lions' game on Wednesday night against the Sharks in Johannesburg was in doubt after the Lions' positive test was announced less than five hours before the match was set to kick off.The Lions didn't identify the staff member who tested positive. But the result meant two players and two other staff members \\u2014 all deemed close contacts \\u2014 were also being isolated at the team hotel in Johannesburg, where the Lions have been based since arriving in the country at the start of last week.The Lions have only played one of the eight games on their tour schedule, which includes a three-test series against the world champion Springboks at the end of the tour.Wednesday night's game against South African domestic team the Sharks might still go ahead, the Lions said, depending on the results of a new batch of tests. The kickoff was delayed by an hour to give the Lions time to get those results and analyze them.\\\"We have followed all necessary precautions since the start of the tour which included regular testing and rigorous COVID-19 counter measure planning and protocols,\\\" said Lions managing director Ben Calveley. \\\"Our priority is to ensure the health and safety of the entire touring party, which is why we quickly isolated the players and staff upon receiving the news of the positive result.\\\"Everyone has subsequently been lateral flow and PCR tested,\\\" he continued. \\\"The Medical Advisory Group await the results of the PCR testing in order to make a decision on tonight's game.\\\"Shortly before the Lions' announcement, the Springboks said they had canceled their second test against Georgia scheduled for Friday night, also in Johannesburg, after at least a dozen positive virus tests among Springboks players and staff since Monday. They included head coach Jacques Nienaber.Georgia also had six positive tests in its camp, confirming outbreaks in both teams after they played the first test last Friday in Pretoria.A third Lions game next Wednesday was also in question.South Africa A and the British and Irish Lions are due to play in Cape Town next week but it's unclear if that will go ahead. It will depend on the extent of the outbreaks in both the Lions and the Springboks squads. Players for the South Africa A team will be taken from the larger Springboks squad, which is now in isolation in its team hotel.Anyone who has tested positive or deemed to be a close contact of someone who has tested positive must isolate and is not allowed to travel for at least 10 days, according to South African government guidelines.That meant that both South Africa and the Lions may have to leave players and coaching staff behind in Johannesburg when the tour moves to Cape Town next week.\\\"The enlarged Springbok squad's travel plans are now being reviewed to comply with COVID-19 protocols,\\\" SA Rugby said.\",\n",

Photo / APRoger Federer has been feted by plenty of ovations at Wimbledon's Centre Court. None quite like this one, though. This was not a celebration and didn't come at the end of the match.Instead, it delayed the beginning of what turned out to be the last game of his quarterfinal loss and felt more like a \\\"thank you\\\" or \\u2014 just in case \\u2014 a \\\"goodbye.\\\" And Federer acknowledged afterward he isn't sure whether he'll be back.The eight-time champion at the All England Club bowed out 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-0 against 14th-seeded Hubert Hurkacz of Poland today, a surprisingly lopsided finish to Federer's 22nd appearance in the tournament.Asked whether it also might have been his last appearance here, he replied: \\\"I don't know. I really don't know. I've got to regroup.\\\"As for whether retirement is an immediate possibility, he offered this: \\\"No, I hope not. ... The goal is to play, of course.\\\"Switzerland's Roger Federer wipes his face with a towel during the men's singles quarterfinals match against Poland's Hubert Hurkacz. Photo / APThat likely was on thousands of minds in the stadium when Federer stepped to the baseline to serve while trailing 5-0 in the third set: He waited while fans in the full-to-capacity stands applauded and cheered, some rising to their feet.Soon enough, it was over, only the third shutout set ceded by Federer in 429 career Grand Slam matches; both of the others came at the French Open.\\\"The last few games, obviously, you can feel that you're not coming back from it,\\\" said Federer, who spoke steadily and did not betray any emotion in his news conference. \\\"I'm not used to that kind of situation, obviously, very much. Especially not here.\\\"Hurkacz, a 24-year-old from Poland who has called Federer his idol, was asked whether he could have imagined this result.\\\"Probably not,\\\" he responded.And yet, this was not the Federer the world is used to watching. He underwent two operations on his right knee in 2020. He arrived at Wimbledon having played eight matches this season.Poland's Hubert Hurkacz celebrates after defeating Switzerland's Roger Federer during the men's singles quarterfinals. Photo / APFactor in that Federer turns 40 on Aug. 8 and maybe it was too much to ask that he make his way to the closing weekend, even if this is a tournament he's won more than any other man, and even if it's contested on a surface, grass, on which he's best.He simply never was able to summon the serving and shot-making that carried him to 20 Grand Slam titles, tied with Rafael Nadal for the men's record.\\\"I'm actually very happy I made it as far as I did here and I actually was able to play Wimbledon at the level that I did after everything I went through,\\\" said Federer, who reiterated that he has not decided whether to go to the Tokyo Olympics. \\\"Of course I would like to play (Wimbledon) again, but at my age, you're just never sure what's around the corner.\\\"Hurkacz's opponent Friday will be No. 7 Matteo Berrettini of Italy, who eliminated No. 16 Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 to reach his second major semifinal.Hurkacz never had made it beyond the third round at any Slam.In Friday's semifinal on the other half of the draw, No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic faces No. 10 Denis Shapovalov.After racing to a 5-0 lead at the outset Wednesday, Djokovic dropped three consecutive games to 48th-ranked Marton Fucsovics. Wasted five set points in the process, too. Soon enough, Djokovic righted himself, as he usually does, and beat Fucsovics 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to reach his 10th semifinal at the All England Club and 41st at a Slam.That allowed the 34-year-old from Serbia to continue his pursuit of a sixth championship at Wimbledon \\u2014 and third in a row \\u2014 along with a 20th major trophy.There's this, too: Djokovic is 19-0 at majors this season as he pursues the first calendar-year Grand Slam by a man since Rod Laver in 1969. Djokovic won the Australian Open in February and the French Open in June.\\\"I'm not chasing anybody,\\\" Djokovic said. \\\"I'm making my own path and my own journey, my own history.\\\"Shapovalov edged No. 25 Karen Khachanov of Russia 6-4, 3-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-4, then looked ahead to facing Djokovic.\\\"I do believe that I have the game to beat him,\\\" said Shapovalov, a 22-year-old left-hander from Canada.Hurkacz appeared quite comfortable on this unfamiliar stage. He played sublimely, with three times as many winners, 36, as unforced errors, 12.\\\"Obviously, I was a little bit nervous. I mean, playing against Roger in a Grand Slam quarterfinal, it's a very big thing for me,\\\" Hurkacz said. \\\"But I was trying to stay as calm as I could.\\\"Federer finally seemed to make some headway in the second set, ahead 3-0.\\\"Got to find a way to win it, somehow,\\\" Federer mused afterward.But Hurkacz conceded nothing.Undaunted by the setting, the stakes, the foe or the almost-uniformly-for-Federer fans, Hurkacz claimed four of the next fives game to pull even at 4-all, breaking along the way with a stinging forehand return of a 101 mph serve that drew a netted a backhand.In the tiebreaker \\u2014 preceded by loud chants of \\\"Let's go, Roger! Let's go!\\\" and rhythmic clapping \\u2014 it was more of the same: Hurkacz hitting his spots and Federer stumbling.\\\"Brutal,\\\" Federer said.On one foray to the net, he lost his footing and missed what could have been a simple volley.The third set went by in a blink. When Federer missed a forehand wide to close things, he packed his bags and hustled off toward the locker room with a wave and a thumbs-up.\\\"Now that that's over, you've just got to reassess everything. You've got to sit down, talk about it: What went well? What didn't go so well? Where is the body? Where is the knee? Where is the mind?\\\" said Federer, who will meet with his two coaches and other members of his team. \\\"As you can see, it was a struggle for me.\\\"\",\n",

Photo / Getty ImagesKiwi-founded alternative commentary startup Spalk has raised US$3 million ($4.3m) in a Series A round supported by a clutch of sports personalities - including Steven Adams and Greg Norman. Spalk was founded by recent Auckland University grads Ben Reynolds and Michael Prendergast in 2015. The pair landed a spot in Vodafone NZ's Xone business incubator the following year to develop their \\\"next-generation sports broadcasting\\\" startup - which syncs alternative commentary offered by bloggers and podcasters with live broadcasters. Spalk co-founders Michael Prendergast (left) and Ben Reynolds. Photo / SuppliedOften, the service is used by those after multilingual options. Watching a Euro 2020 match that's only offered in English but to want to hear it with a Spanish or Hindi commentary? A Spalk partner could be able to help.Spalk can also be used to access an alternative commentary provided by an athlete or social media influencer.And official broadcasters can use Spalk as part of a cost-saving remote production effort if there are no funds for flying commentators to an event - or even perhaps a local studio.With little interest from local broadcasters, Spalk looked offshore, and it now numbers streaming services DAZN and Sports Flick among its broadcast partners, and its technology is used by sporting bodies including World Rugby, Six Nations Rugby, FIBA (the International Basketball Federation) and FIVB (the International Beach Volleyball Federation.Co-founder Reynolds says Spalk built the world's largest talent marketplace of professional commentators, providing access to pre-vetted freelancers in more than 50 languages across 30 sports.Today, Spalk has a dozen staff across a New York operations office (led by Renolds), a broadcasting hub in London and an Auckland office run by Prendergast.How did a small Kiwi startup land Greg Norman as a backer?\\\"We pitched Greg at a Shark Tank-style competition called 'Search for the Next Sports Entrepreneur' that he hosted at the University of Miami in March 2017,\\\" Reynolds says. \\\"At the time, we were exploring the US as a prospective market. Following the meeting, Greg led our seed investment round in October 2018.\\\"\\\"The CFO of the Greg Norman Company, Michael Filon, has a board seat and they have been integral to our global rollout and monetisation over the past two years.\\\"And how Adams join the party?\\\"We met Steven through Greg Norman's family office,\\\" Reynolds says.\\\"Greg and his team do a lot of work with other professional athlete family offices - mentoring, co-investing and sharing deal flow. Spalk was a great opportunity for Greg and Steven to support a company from New Zealand that is succeeding internationally.\\\"Former golfing world number one, and major winner, Greg Norman is among Spalk backers. Photo / Getty ImagesThe US$3m just raised came mainly from US backers, but Icehouse Ventures also chipped in locally.Formula E driver Mitch Evans also put money into the US$3m round. And so did Stadia Ventures, a US outfit that specialises in sports-related investments.Reynolds says Spalk is now starting to hit its marks. Revenue has tripled to US$150,000 per month over the past year, and the startup hit profit for the first time earlier this year.The new funds will go, in part, to hiring five new technical roles for Spalk's NZ office, in Parnell. It will also be used to boost marketing efforts.\\\"We do a small amount of business in New Zealand - for example, later this month we are supporting the Steven Adams Invitational for up and coming high school basketball players in New Zealand to gain exposure to US College Scouts,\\\" he says (see last year's event here).\\\"And we will be supporting with M\\u0101ori and several Pasifika Languages of commentary on the tournament.\\\"But our primary market is international with Olympic Federations and Global Sports Leagues that require multi-lingual productions - although we are definitely hoping to work with Sky, TVNZ and Spark Sport in the future.\\\"Meantime, there's plenty of overseas work to keep Spalk busy.\\\"Using our Virtual Commentary Studio, sports leagues and broadcasters no longer have to fly commentators to the stadium or studio to call games \\u2013 they can do it from a laptop anywhere in the world,\\\" Reynolds says.\\\"We are really proud to have support from Greg, Steven, Mitch and our other investors and are excited to continue leading the industry when it comes to remote commentary production and distribution.\\\"Stadia Ventures managing partner Brandon Janosky says: \\\"Remote production and personalisation of live content represent the intersection of two mega-trends in sport and we are excited to support Spalk as they disrupt this multi-billion dollar, legacy industry.\\\"\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"The injured three are Josephine Perkins (with scarf). Jonah Seeds (crutches) and Finn O'Sullivan. Photo / Rob van Dort\\\"Competing is what I do between injuries\\\" a leading British middle-distance runner purportedly said in the early 1980s.Certainly, injury is a frustrating fact of life for all in sport and all face frustration and angst during rehabilitation, especially if that period is lengthy.Injuries happen for a huge variety of reasons. Coaches are rightly concerned if there are a group of similar injuries in a training group, forcing examination of schedules and activities.Injuries can come from faulty equipment or problems at the training venue. Shortly before the Cooks Gardens track was resurfaced there was a spate of similar injuries that did not reoccur when that track was resurfaced. We all hope that when the next resurfacing is due in a couple of years that there is no delay that could risk injuring athletes and also put the hosting of major events in jeopardy.However, many injuries, especially among less experienced younger athletes, occur away from training and competition.I can remember one promising 400m runner who was not able to take his place in a championship 4 x 400m team after a Shot accident. This did not happen on a sports ground but at school when bored mates starting tossing the implement about.In 1994 leading sprinter Mark Keddell was on his way to the World Junior Championships and rolled his ankle in a fun game of football at the New Zealand Team base in Kornwestheim, Germany.We were fortunate that we had former Whanganui and Olympic physiotherapist Fiona Gutschlag with us who made immediate diagnosis and then treatment up to twice a day in the fortnight before the Championships.Keddell finished 5th in the 200m and ran an outstanding leg in the New Zealand 4 x 400 team finishing fourth at the World Junior Championships. I have often reflected what might have been without the injury interruption to his final training. Good diagnosis and medical expertise on hand is a luxury that is not so easy to find and obtain away from the high-performance sport environment.All too often younger athletes have a long wait for clear diagnosis and necessary MRI scans and expert follow-up, adding delay and frustration to their return to action.The internet has changed our lives and certainly young athletes are influenced about what they read about leading athletes and try to follow their programmes, which they are not ready for.As a young physical education student at Loughborough in Leicestershire my major study was on middle-distance training. I read extensively and was particularly interested in the training programmes of Arthur Lydiard and his group of New Zealand athletes.I became an instant disciple and went straight into attempting to run a 100 miles a week. It was not long before I was in the hands of the physiotherapist learning a valuable lesson about progression in training.Athletes in the search for success often add to prescribed training. They believe if training x is good 2x must be twice as good. I can remember one outstanding athlete in my coaching group who whenever I was away for more than a week would add additional training. I inevitably returned to an athlete with an injury.The Whanganui Collegiate cross country teams would have been stronger with the presence of three leading injured athletes. Josephine Perkins has had a series of injuries all of which have been different. I have long supported variety in sport although additional activity does carry additional injury risk.In 2020 Perkins, the 1st XI girls football goalkeeper, injured herself playing outfield just three days before last year's cross country teams challenge, the replacement for the cancelled New Zealand Schools Cross Country. This year football was the loser as Perkins broke her ankle when running in the school cross country \\u2013 double frustration.Jonah Seeds who arrived at Collegiate from Hutt Valley International Boys School (HIBS) in May ran superbly in the Karori Relays two weeks after his arrival and was added to the squad for New Zealand Schools. He too was injured playing football missing the championships.The third athlete falls into the injured away from training/competition category after he was pushed in a House cheering practice. Finn O'Sullivan had made an immediate impact in track and field on his arrival from Christchurch in February. He has now missed all of March and Term 2 and surgical intervention might be needed to get him back to athletic action. All three have suffered the frustration of not being able to train and compete and long to be back in action.Hopefully, we can look forward to an injury-free second half of 2021.\",\n",

But he is less impressed about the fate of a racetrack he has considered his second home for a long time. Anderson, who trains at Westwood Beach, south of Dunedin, has the most wins (179) as a horse trainer at Forbury Park, and as the course will cease to exist as a harness racing venue after tonight's meeting \\u2014 there will still be greyhound race meetings on July 18, 23 and 30 \\u2014 that record will exist in perpetuity. That goes only so far to mollify Anderson, who is \\\"gutted, really\\\" that Forbury Park is to close as it has been deemed uneconomic by ruling body Harness Racing New Zealand. \\\"A city the size of Dunedin losing a track like that, which has been here as long as it has, doesn't sit well with me. \\\"The reasons for closing it are not, in my opinion, the right reasons. It's a pity MPs and the city council couldn't get in behind it and help retain it. \\\"It's a real shame that we are losing it. You can understand some of the difficulties they've been facing, but I thought Harness Racing New Zealand could have helped us a bit more.\\\" Anderson hopes there will still be harness racing in Dunedin in the future, perhaps as a tenant at the Otago Racing Club's Wingatui base. He will retain fond memories of Forbury Park, the venue for nearly half his career wins. \\\"I've followed trotting since I can remember. It's a famous track, and the track itself is in great order. A lot of the drivers rate it the best winter track in the country. \\\"I drove on there the other night, and the lights were on, and I thought, what a waste to close this place down. \\\"It's also one of the best viewing tracks in the country because you can stand out in front of the old grandstand and the action is right at your face. \\\"It's a sad day in our life to see this happen.\\\" Anderson said he was only recently made aware he was the all-time leading trainer at Forbury Park after seeing a story from Otago Daily Times correspondent Jonny Turner. He is followed by Cran Dalgety (166 wins), Bruce Negus (140), Phil Williamson (115) and Amber Hoffman (113). Titan Banner, who started at Forbury Park before tasting Group 1 success, and Eamon Maguire were two of the best horses Anderson had at the course, and he enjoyed winning a 4yr-old championship with Ballindooley for \\\"a great bunch of owners\\\". Anderson and training partner Mike Love have just one horse going round tonight \\u2014 La Reina Del Sur, in race three, with Matthew Williamson in the sulky \\u2014 but they are also looking after a couple of horses on behalf of other trainers. \\u00a0- hayden.meikle@odt.co.nz\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"Secure youth justice facilities are supposed to provide rehabilitation for young people guilty of crimes.\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"Secure youth justice facilities are supposed to provide rehabilitation for young people guilty of crimes. However, 75 percent of those detained haven't been sentenced, and nearly all of them are M\\u0101ori and Pasifika. Baz Macdonald looks at what's going on. Oranga Tamariki sign Source: RE: Across the country, four secure youth facilities are used to detain people under the age of 17 facing criminal charges. Another one is also under construction. Run by Oranga Tamariki, they are supposed to be for long-term rehabilitation of young people whose charges have been proven. However, a youth justice advocate says conditions inside do the opposite. Even worse, most of the residents haven't actually been found guilty of criminal charges. In Auckland and Christchurch, the facilities are on the same sites as adult prisons. They are ringed by high concrete walls and barbed wire fences. Young people follow a strict routine with chores, school and skills development under the supervision of social workers. If they act aggressively, they are moved into an isolated unit to cool off. Youth Justice advocate Tania Sawicki Mead from JustSpeak says the facilities 'are basically child prisons' that essentially put young people on a pathway to further interaction with the justice system. Each year, about 500 young people are sent to them. Right now, the youngest person detained is just 13, and the average age is 17. Most people stay for about 40 days, and the max stay through a youth court sentence is six months. But there are also young people who have committed crimes serious enough to be charged as an adult. They will be transferred to an adult correctional facility once they turn 18. Tania: 'What we know about secure youth justice facilities and prisons is that they increase the likelihood of them staying stuck in the justice system, rather than actually helping to change the conditions that lead them into the system in the first place.' \\u2018The talk is crime, crime, crime' The numbers support what Tania says. In 2019, an Oranga Tamariki report found 88 percent of young people placed in youth justice facilities reoffended in the next 12 months. A quarter of those re-offences were \\u2018against justice' - which most commonly means breaching a bail condition such as curfew. Notably, bail breaches have been identified as a significant factor in the cycle of reoffending. A 2019 report from the Office of the Children's Commissioner highlighted the issue, and found many young people said it 'sets them up to fail'. 'Cause you've broken the law', one young person said in the report, 'you get told what to do'. 'They should ask you what you think would work, \\u2018cause otherwise you won't stick to it.' Another interview with a 16-year-old said: 'In residence, the young ones learn the tricks from the older ones. The talk is crime, crime, crime.' In recent years there have also been reports on a range of issues with youth facilities, including reports of high rates of self-harm incidents and use of seclusion and restraint. Detained before being sentenced And while Oranga Tamariki says they have addressed these problems, the high number of young people detained in facilities before they've been sentenced remains an issue. Overall, 75 percent of young people are there on remand. Most commonly, this means they have been charged, but have not yet been sentenced or even found guilty - typically because they are awaiting a court date or have been placed there on a court order for further observation. 'These people haven't been sentenced, so there is a due process problem,' Tania says. Children's Commissioner judge Andrew Becroft has repeatedly criticised the practice. They were designed only for holding those whose charges had been proved, judge Becroft said previously. Despite that, in 2019, he noted secure youth facilities had become the default option for holding young people waiting to be sentenced. Additionally, some young people are also detained when they have nowhere safe to stay while going through the youth and district court system. Tania says more resources should be dedicated to community remand homes, where young people who get into trouble with the law can work with social workers while remaining connected with their school and family. 'Young people who don't have safe home environments are the most likely to get trapped in the justice system, but they need somewhere else safe and supportive to be,' she says. Currently, there are 17 remand homes in New Zealand, each with four to five beds. Tania says these have been effective, and further resources need to be put into them to ensure kids end up here instead of secure facilities, or even worse, a prison cell. Recent reporting from RNZ also looked into the issue, and found when police did not have access to a safe place for young people to go, they were placed in police cells. The Children's Commissioner and Green Party MP Golriz Ghamaran have called for an urgent repeal of the law enabling the youth court to remand children into police custody. Systemic racism: Up to 90 per cent\\u00a0M\\u0101ori and Pasifika The overrepresentation of M\\u0101ori and Pasifika in youth facilities is another significant problem. 80 to 90 percent of residents identify as M\\u0101ori and Pasifika - even higher than in adult prisons, where M\\u0101ori and Pasifika make up about two-thirds. Tania says these numbers reflect a racist system. 'We see this issue across the whole justice system, there is a deep issue of systemic racism in the people who are not given the benefit of the doubt,' she says. 'M\\u0101ori are subjected to much harsher or more skeptical lines of questioning. As opposed to young pakeha where diversions are considered first and foremost.' Oranga Tamariki: \\u2018It's improved a lot' Oranga Tamariki admits there have been problems in the past with young people being sent to secure youth justice facilities for minor offences. However, the agency's regional manager youth justice, Ben Hannifin, says this is now a rare occurrence - particularly following a ramp up of community remand homes from 5 to 17 since 2019. 'The intent of the youth justice system is to keep young people away from the escalation into facilities like residences and then as adults into correctional facilities,' Ben says. 'The more we can keep young people in their homes, or community facilities, the better the outcome.' According to Oranga Tamariki, the average first admission into a secure facility is five years after a person enters the youth justice system. 'They have been through diversions with the police, been through community services, and have also often been excluded from school for several years,' Ben says. 'Often the barrier that brings them in is an escalation of the seriousness of their offences. Very rarely do we receive a young person without a long history of interventions.' \\u2018It's a collection of needs' As to the high number of young people on remand in facilities, Ben says those decisions around length of stay are determined by judges. 'The remand time often extends because you pick up a lot of other complexities that can't be identified in a short amount of time - things like mental health, neurodisabilities or head injuries.' 'Those specialist reports take a long time, and so the judge might get those details and decide it is not time to release them to custodians,' Ben says. He also touches on the high number of M\\u0101ori and Pasifika in facilities, but stops short of discussing systemic racism. It's a 'collection of needs' like M\\u0101ori and Pasifika often living in lower socio-economic communities with higher incidence of drug and alcohol abuse, school dropout rates, and gang activity as a possible explanation, Ben says. Overall, Oranga Tamariki's youth facilities help prevent further interaction with the justice system, Ben says. 'A lot of the young kids we've got in our care, their brothers have been through it, their parents are in prison. There is a real sense of foregone-ness to some of these young people's stories. 'The intent of the youth justice system is to keep young people away from the escalation into facilities like residences and then as adults into correctional facilities.'\",\n",

It comes after a 31-year-old man was arrested last month on charges of burglary and assault, allegedly attacking a father and daughter while attempting to burgle their Fifield Tce home. Board chairwoman Alexandra Davids said members wanted to support the community affected by similar crimes that have happened recently. 'It's a stressful time for people, they don't really know what's around the corner,' she said. 'So we're trying to remind the community to stay vigilant, look out for one another, making sure they're locking their homes and being a bit more mindful that unfortunately, this is happening. 'There's not a lot the council can do, but having a platform to be able to remind the community to be vigilant is a great opportunity for us.' Additionally, several posts made by residents in the Opawa Neighbourhood Facebook page stated similar incidents involving robberies in recent weeks. One resident feared for her family's safety after thieves broke into their home while they were sleeping, stealing tools. Another resident said their child's bike was stolen from the property in broad daylight. As a result, the Christchurch South Community Patrol leapt into action as stated in a post made by a patrol spokesperson. 'We're always keeping an eye out in the community groups and have seen the recent posts. I've passed on relevant information to our patrol leader and we will increase the number of patrols in the area,' the post read. 'If anyone has any information on the robberies in the area, please let us know the times they have happened as well as the street, so we can better target our patrols.' Davids said Opawa was lucky to have community patrols that can pick up extra monitoring work when police resources can often be stretched. Although she was concerned about the type of incidents occurring in the area, the problem was not exclusive to Opawa, and that they often occurred in cycles. Said Davids: 'Burglaries and home invasions, whether influenced by gangs or petty crime, do seem to come in cycles and we do see some communities targeted from time to time. But you see it drop off as well when they change their locations. 'We're lucky to have those community patrols that do hover around and keep an eye out.' Police did not respond to questions from Star News, but the board is meeting with police in the coming weeks to discuss community concerns, including the burglaries, as well as 'issues around drinking in public,' and installing security cameras in public places. 'We're always there to advocate for the community and we welcome anyone to come up to us with their concerns, giving us the opportunity to speak to the right people,' Davids said. 'When people are looking out for each other, others looking to do something negative will be put off knowing everyone is banding together.'\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"If the Government's smokefree action plan does not adequately elevate nicotine vaping as the much safer alternative, then cigarette smuggling will become a bigger problem at New Zealand's border, says a leading Kiwi Tobacco Harm Reduction advocate. \\nHer comments follow a media investigation which revealed Customs is currently seizing around 125,000 smuggled cigarettes and 155 kilograms of loose tobacco every month. \\nNew Zealand Customs describes it as a lucrative market. In fact, it's thought to be eight times more profitable than cocaine \\u2013 and one which has attracted organised crime. Large scale, commercial-grade cigarette smuggling operators are now well established.\\nIt's spurred on by the fact that New Zealand has the most expensive cigarettes for legal purchase in the world.\\n'With the Government set to get even tougher on the appeal and availability of legal cigarettes, there is a concern it will only lead to more illicit cigarette smuggling. It doesn't have to be the case though, particularly if smokers are activity encouraged to switch to safer nicotine products,' says Nancy Loucas, co-director of the Aotearoa Vapers Community Advocacy (AVCA).\\nTDB Recommends NewzEngine.com\\nAssociate Health Minster Dr Ayesha Verrall is now finalising the Government's Smokefree\\u00a0Aotearoa 2025\\u00a0Action Plan after releasing a discussion document for public consultation which closed on 31 May.\\nAVCA is highly supportive of getting tough on combustible tobacco given 5,000 Kiwis continue to die every year from smoking-related illnesses. It's concerned, however, that the discussion document was light on vaping's key role in achieving smokefree. It has pushed for vaping \\u2013 the world's most effective smoking cessation tool \\u2013 to feature more in the final smokefree action plan.\\n'We've got to get more Kiwis successfully off the cancer sticks in the first place, otherwise many will head to the black market. If we can switch them from cigarettes to vaping, not only will it save countless lives, but it will put a hole in organised crime,' she says.\\nThe head of AVCA says the latest media revelation exposing the sheer scale of cigarette smuggling completely discredits recent claims by University of Otago public health experts published on 27 May.\\nTitled \\u2018Illicit tobacco trade and the Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 Goal: Arguments and Evidence', the research analysis concluded that \\u2018NZ's illicit tobacco market is small and unlikely to grow substantially.'\\n'We knew they were wrong then, but they've now been proven woefully out of touch. They argue getting tougher on legal smoking won't make much difference at the border. AVCA argues it will be an absolute nightmare for Customs, unless many more smokers are actively encouraged to switch to vaping,' says Nancy Loucas.\\nAbout AVCA\\nAVCA was formed in 2016 by vapers across New Zealand wanting their voices heard in local and central government. All members are former smokers who promote vaping to help smokers quit \\u2013 a much less harmful alternative to combustible tobacco products. AVCA does not have any affiliation or vested interest in industry \\u2013 tobacco, pharmaceutical and/or the local vaping manufacturing or retail sectors.\\nwww.avca.org.nz\",\n",

After more than a year of horror from the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 600,000 American lives, a highly-vaccinated public was gathering together to celebrate a return to normal, according to US President Joe Biden.\\\"America is back,\\\" he said.But hanging over the\\u00a0evening was the shadow of a previous gathering.The National Mall hadn't hosted a crowd that large in almost six months, not since\\u00a0the January 6\\u00a0Capitol riot, when a\\u00a0mob of Donald Trump's supporters attempted to stop Congress from certifying Biden's electoral victory.On that day, hundreds of Americans stormed the building, sending\\u00a0politicians fleeing into barricaded rooms and causing Capitol Police to fear\\u00a0for their lives.The hunt to identify perpetrators\\u00a0is ongoing.\\u00a0The FBI has a special \\\"Capital Violence\\\" page on its website with nearly 1000 pictures and videos of 300 people allegedly involved in the break-in. They're labeled \\\"unidentified\\\".The person who planted two pipe bombs outside the offices of the Democratic and Republican national committees (a move officers suspect was designed to draw them away from Congress) is still on the run.But more than 500 people have been arrested. A few dozen have pleaded guilty, including two members of the Oath Keepers militia group who admitted to conspiring with other extremists.Only one person has been sentenced so far, an Indiana woman who pleaded guilty to unlawfully entering the Capitol \\u2014\\u00a0and subsequently\\u00a0avoided jail time. After the riot, she posted on Facebook that January 6 was the\\u00a0\\\"best day ever\\\".You probably remember Jacob Chansley, the \\\"QAnon Shaman\\\". He's in federal custody awaiting\\u00a0trial on six criminal charges.He lost a bid to be released from jail\\u00a0and is undergoing a psychological evaluation to see whether he's fit to stand trial.Congressional efforts to get to the bottom of what happened aren't progressing much faster.An effort to establish a bipartisan commission flamed out, as Senate\\u00a0Republicans used the filibuster for the first time during\\u00a0the Biden administration to shoot down a bill that had majority support.Republicans who even dared entertain the notion of further examination of the attack have been turfed out of leadership positions or are now\\u00a0facing primary contests from candidates who are raising impressive sums of money.Democrats have taken the only path left available\\u00a0and created a House select committee that will investigate the attacks, but there's much we don't know about how it will work.Will it have subpoena power? How long will it have to complete its work?Will it call former president Donald Trump to testify? If he testified, what would he even say?In the time since leaving office, the former president has moved considerably in his own views of the riots.Despite reportedly calling the rioters \\\"idiots\\\" and \\\"not our people\\\" as he watched on television on the day of the attack, he softened in March to claim there was \\\"zero threat\\\" from the people who entered the Capitol.Twice this week, Trump showed a willingness to move even further from his initial stance by asking\\u00a0\\\"Who shot Ashley Babbitt?\\\" at a rally and a press conference.As New York Magazine pointed out, Babbitt \\u2014 a former air force veteran who was radicalised by QAnon conspiracy theories and killed by police on the day of the attacks \\u2014 has become a martyr among those on the\\u00a0far right, who consider her death a sacrifice in service of a greater cause.That claim now features centrally in the strategy of a former president aiming\\u00a0to regain control of US politics ahead of the 2022 midterms \\u2026 and beyond.Today, around the US Capitol, however, some of the last fences that went up in the wake of the attacks are about to come down.The metaphorical fences erected\\u00a0between corporate America and politicians who objected to the certification of Biden's victory have come down as well, with some of the richest US companies\\u00a0turning on the donation firehoses\\u00a0again.So\\u00a0it's not just public life returning to normal as the\\u00a0pandemic winds down, but also politics, just six months after an \\\"existential crisis\\\" that \\\"shocked and saddened the nation and the world,\\\" according to Biden.The battle to define that normalcy as necessary for\\u00a0the healing of the nation, or a dangerous reframing of history, is only just beginning.Election feverNew York's long and messy mayoral primary race\\u00a0is finally over.Eric Adams has been declared the winner for the\\u00a0Democrats, and is the overwhelming favourite to take the office after the general election in November.\\u00a0He\\u00a0beat Kathryn Garcia by a narrow margin of 8,400 points, or less than one percentage point, meaning candidates may still contest the results, though no one has spoken out yet.\\u00a0The close race had the city watching the numbers fluctuate with each ballot dump, especially after\\u00a0one major ballot-counting debacle.Adams only became the clear winner after 118,000 absentee ballots went through the city's ranked choice voting system -- the first time it was employed in New York history.The race is considered the most critical measure of Democratic political opinion since the 2020 Presidential primary.US media is making a lot of Adams' background in law enforcement. New York saw a spike in shootings in the lead up to polling day (it's still so bad that Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a public emergency this week).Adams' campaign struck a balanced tone \\u2014\\u00a0advocating to rein in crime while still tackling police bias and misconduct.And that brings us to\\u00a0the key takeaway from this race: As Republicans continue to accuse their counterparts of being apathetic about crime and unsympathetic to the police, Democrats everywhere will be taking notes of Adam's successful messaging.It's still\\u2026. 2016?Russian cyberattacks against US political institutions feel too common to distinguish individually\\u00a0these days, but it's worth taking note of a pair of back-to-back hackings that happened this week.A possible breach of the Republican National Committee and the infiltration that spread to an estimated 1500 global businesses are proving a big test for President Biden.It was just three weeks ago, during his first sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin, that Biden presented a list of 16 economic sectors that, if attacked, would merit retaliation.The thing is he never really said what kind of retaliation that would be. In response to reporters' questions, he said simply \\\"he knows\\\".Biden convened a group of officials yesterday (local time) to discuss strategy, but all that's come out of it is\\u00a0a promise to deliver a message to Putin. What message? We don't know?\\u00a0So when it comes to the US-Russia relationship, it still feels like we're in the Trump era. A lot of bark, no real bite.Breaking the internetWe've known that Trump and his team have been searching for an alternative to the social media services he was booted off (and is now suing).\\u00a0RIP Parler\\u00a0and the blog-that-wasn't-a-blog.\\u00a0This week delivered the next contender to the arena, and it's going about as well as you'd expect.Gettr, which is intended to operate a lot like Twitter, chose July 4 for its splashy debut, and promised to be a \\\"marketplace of ideas\\\" with no \\\"woke tyranny\\\" and would not ban users for their views.In reality, that translated to a flood of imposter accounts, anti-conservative memes and \\u2026 Sonic the Hedgehog erotica.As the ABC's technology reporter James Purtill pointed out, Gettr ran into a problem that any\\u00a0pro-Trump social media network is going to encounter: promising not to moderate content may see\\u00a0Gettr\\u00a0booted off major app stores, but being anti-moderation is key to their product differentiation.\\u00a0Perhaps it doesn't matter. Despite Gettr being run by a former Trump aide, the former president hasn't endorsed it, which probably points to its future prospects.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Source: European Parliament\\nOn Thursday, the European Parliament adopted three resolutions on the human rights situation in Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and Iran.\\n\\nHong Kong, notably the case of Apple Daily\\nParliament condemns in the strongest terms the recent forced closure of the Apple Daily newspaper in Hong Kong, the continued freezing of its assets and the arrests of its journalists. This is yet another step by Chinese authorities to dismantle free society in Hong Kong and abolish media freedom and freedom of expression there, MEPs say.\\nThe resolution also calls on the Hong Kong authorities to stop harassing and intimidating journalists, release arbitrarily detained prisoners, and denounces any attempts to muzzle pro-democracy activists and their activities.\\nWhile urging the Chinese authorities to repeal the draconian national security law introduced last year, MEPs encourage EU countries to impose sanctions against individuals and entities responsible for serious violations of human rights and international law in Hong Kong under the EU human rights sanctions regime.\\nThey also call on the Commission, the Council and EU countries to decline invitations to government representatives and diplomats to attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics unless the Chinese Government demonstrates a verifiable improvement in the human rights situation in Hong Kong, the Xinjiang Uyghur Region, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and elsewhere in China.\\nThe text was adopted by 578 votes in favour, 29 against and 73 abstentions. For further details, the full version will be available here. (08.07.2021)\\nThe death penalty in Saudi Arabia, notably the cases of Mustafa Hashem al-Darwish and Abdullah al-Howaiti\\nMEPs strongly condemn Saudi Arabia's ongoing executions of child offenders despite its claims that it has abolished such practices. This includes the recent execution of Mustafa Hashem al-Darwish for crimes that may have occurred while he was a minor following his conviction in an unfair trial and involving a confession obtained from him under torture.\\nMembers also call on Saudi Arabia to confirm that all other child offenders in the Kingdom, such as death-row inmate Abdullah al-Howaiti, will not be executed and that \\u2018confessions' extracted under torture will be excluded from their cases.\\nWhile urging the country's authorities to genuinely abolish the death penalty for these offenders, the resolution strongly supports EU sanctions against Saudi officials responsible for grave human rights violations. All EU exports of mass surveillance technology and other dual-use items to Saudi Arabia should be suspended, say MEPs.\\nThe resolution also recalls that the Saudi Sakharov Prize laureate Raif Badawi has now been in prison for nine years and urges the EU and the international community to work towards his immediate release.\\nThe text was adopted by 661 votes in favour, 3 against and 23 abstentions. It will be available in full here (08.07.2021).\\nThe case of Dr Ahmadreza Djalali in Iran\\nParliament calls on Iran, under its newly elected President Ebrahim Raisi, to halt the imminent execution of Swedish-Iranian academic Dr Ahmadreza Djalali. He must be pardoned, released immediately and unconditionally, and be allowed to return to his family in Sweden, says the text.\\nThe resolution also calls on Iran to stop threatening Dr Djalali's family in both Sweden and Iran. The charges of other arbitrarily detained EU nationals in the country must also be immediately dropped, MEPs demand. This includes German nationals Nahid Taghavi and Jamshid Sharmahd, French nationals Benjamin Bri\\u00e8re and Fariba Adelkhah, Austrian nationals Kamran Ghaderi and Massud Mossaheb, in addition to UK nationals Morad Tahbaz, Anoosheh Ashoori, Mehran Raoof and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.\\nThe Council should consider more targeted EU sanctions against Iranian regime officials and entities involved in the arbitrary detention and sentencing to death of EU nationals, MEPs urge. The text calls on Iran to release its political prisoners, including human rights defenders, as they have been arbitrarily detained solely for exercising their fundamental rights to the freedoms of expression, belief, association, publication, peaceful assembly and media freedom.\\nFor more details, the resolution will be available in full here (08.07.2021). It was adopted by 666 votes in favour, 5 against with 16 abstentions.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"In a fierce gun battle, Haitian\\u00a0police have apprehended or killed the men they suspect assassinated President Jovenel Mo\\u00efse, and have begun hunting the masterminds of the plot.\\u00a0Two of the men arrested are believed to be Haitian-Americans and one of them is purportedly a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Port au Prince.Mr Mo\\u00efse, 53, was shot dead early on Wednesday at his home by what officials said was a squad of trained killers, pitching the poorest country in the Americas deeper into turmoil.Police chief Leon Charles said in a televised briefing on Thursday that authorities had tracked the suspected assassins to a house near the scene of the crime in Petionville, a northern suburb of the capital Port-au-Prince.The firefight lasted late into the night and six suspects were taken in custody, while three corpses were retrieved, he said.\\u00a0Other reports said seven people were killed while photos showed seven men in custody.\\\"We have the physical authors, now we are looking for the intellectual authors,\\\" Chief Charles said.A Haitian judge involved in the investigation said Mr Mo\\u00efse was shot a dozen times and his office and bedroom were ransacked, according to the Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste.It quoted Judge Carl Henry Destin as saying investigators found 5.56mm and 7.62mm cartridges between the gatehouse and inside the house.Mr Mo\\u00efses's daughter, Jomarlie Jovenel, hid in her brother's bedroom during the attack, he said, and a maid and another worker were tied up by the attackers.Mr Mo\\u00efse's wife was reportedly injured in the attack.Officials have not given a motive for the killing.Two\\u00a0Haitian-Americans were among those detained, said Haiti's Minister of Elections and Interparty Relations, Mathias Pierre.He identified one of them as James Solages, a US\\u00a0citizen of\\u00a0Haitian descent, but did not name the other.Mr Pierre would not provide additional details about Mr Solages's background.\\u00a0Mr Solages described himself as a \\\"certified diplomatic agent\\\",\\u00a0an advocate for children and budding politician on a website for a charity he established in 2019 in south Florida.\\u00a0On his bio page for the charity, Mr Solages said he previously worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti.The Canadian embassy did not immediately comment. Calls to the foundation and Mr Solages's associates at the charity either did not go through or were not answered.\\u00a0The US\\u00a0State Department said it was in regular contact with\\u00a0Haitian officials, including investigative authorities, to discuss how the US could provide assistance.A State Department spokesman, however, could not confirm if any US\\u00a0citizens were among those detained.Officials in mostly French and Creole-speaking Haiti said on Wednesday that the assassins appeared to have spoken in English and Spanish.A crowd of locals gathered on Thursday morning to watch the police operation unfold, with some setting fire to the suspects' cars and to the house where they had bunkered down. Bullets were strewn in the street.\\\"Burn them,\\\" shouted hundreds of locals gathered outside the police station where the suspects were being held.Chief Charles said locals helped police track down the suspects but he implored citizens not to take justice into their own hands.Earlier on Thursday, locals brought two corpses of suspected assassins to the Petionville police station.Power vacuumA 15-day state of emergency was declared on Wednesday to help authorities apprehend the killers.But interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said on Thursday it was time for the economy to reopen and said he had given instructions for the airport to restart operations.Since he took office in 2017, Mr Mo\\u00efse had faced mass protests against his rule \\u2014 first over corruption allegations and his management of the economy, then over his increasing grip on power.The assassination\\u00a0has generated confusion about who is the legitimate leader of the country of 11 million people, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.That does not bode well in a nation that has struggled to achieve stability since the fall of the Duvalier dynastic dictatorship in 1986, grappling with a series of coups and foreign interventions.Mr Joseph on Wednesday took charge of the situation, running the government response to the assassination, appealing to foreign governments for support, and declaring a state of emergency.A presidential vote as well as a constitutional referendum that had been slated for September\\u00a026 would go ahead as planned,\\u00a0Mr Pierre said.\\\"It [the vote]\\u00a0was not for Jovenel Mo\\u00efse as president: it was a requirement to get a more stable country, a more stable political system, so I think we will continue with that,\\\" said Mr Pierre, who added that preparations had long been underway and millions of dollars disbursed to carry out the votes.He said Mr Joseph would lead the country until then.\\u00a0The United Nations Special Envoy for Haiti on Thursday said Mr Joseph would remain the leader until the\\u00a0election was held, urging all parties to set aside their differences.A UN\\u00a0peacekeeping mission \\u2014 meant to restore order after a rebellion toppled then-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004 \\u2014 ended in 2019 with the country still in disarray.\\\"There are many unknowns about what happens next,\\\" said Jake Johnston, a senior research associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.\\\"But it is important to remember that that was also the case before the assassination of Mo\\u00efse.\\\"ABC/wires\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"JULY 9, 2021 Updated 5 hours ago Comment David Seymour pulls ahead of Judith Collins in a race to the bottom in a week of outrage sparked by $200 in\\u00a0taxpayer money. The week in news from James Elliott.\\u00a0 Our politicians like nothing more than a binge of righteous outrage to start the week. So there was no shortage of righteous politicians queuing up to dump their outrage on the steaming pile of criticism of the Human Rights Commission for gifting a $200 koha to the Mongrel Mob at a speaking event in May. 'It's an outrage!' they steamed righteously. 'And it's taxpayer money!' they shrieked in the righteous manner that only those whose salaries and expenses are fully funded by taxpayers can shriek. There's nothing quite like the inappropriate spending of taxpayer money to kick the taxpayer-funded outrage-at-the-inappropriate-spending-of-taxpayer-money machine into overdrive. Taxpayer-funded politicians strategising with taxpayer-funded press secretaries in taxpayer-funded offices crafting expressions of outrage in media releases spewing forth from taxpayer-funded printers on taxpayer-funded paper and pinging their way into the ether from taxpayer-funded email accounts while taxpayer-funded parliamentary staffers are drafting righteous questions for Question Time and other taxpayer-funded parliamentary staffers are drafting equivocating answers to those taxpayer-funded righteous questions for other taxpayer-funded politicians to read out during Question Time as presided over by the taxpayer-funded Speaker from the comfort of the Speaker's chair and its taxpayer-funded woolsack. \\nAlthough David Seymour's\\u00a0libertarian outlook probably makes him philosophically opposed to the concept of gift horses, he wasn't going to look this one in the mouth.\\n You'd be forgiven for forgetting\\u00a0there's a pandemic on, but we can at least be grateful to the epidemiologists for providing a working formula to calculate the exponential growth of taxpayer-funded outrage spending generated in response to the original $200 outrage outbreak. Take the original $200, then multiply it by a very large number of your choice - and you won't even be close. We can also be grateful for an extraordinarily prescient write-up of Outrage Monday by Jason Walls, Newstalk ZB's chief political reporter. Writing in the NZ Herald he reported that 'Although the donation was relatively small, the Opposition says it's completely unacceptable that any amount of taxpayer money was gifted to a gang.' So far so standard, but having referenced 'the Opposition' it's the next two paragraphs that elevated Jason's reportage from standard to soothsaying. He quoted ACT\\u00a0leader David Seymour's outrage and then Judith Collins' outrage, but he did so in that order, David followed by Judith. On Monday that order looked like a simple first name alphabetising of two outraged politicians, but by Thursday evening that ordering was the ranking of the Opposition, David Seymour, as the de facto leader of the Opposition and Judith Collins not. \\nBeing preferred to Judith Collins as the preferred PM doesn't necessarily mean that those who preferred you to Judith actually want you to be the PM.\\n That ranking was provided by a poll by UMR, Labour's pollster although this was not a poll for Labour, that saw David Seymour polling at 12 percent\\u00a0as preferred Prime Minister and Judith Collins at 10 percent. These preferred PM polling numbers prompted Labour's pollster (although this was not a poll for Labour) to conclude that this was 'an unprecedented result'. Labour's pollster (although this was not a poll for Labour) went on to conclude that 'David Seymour can now claim to be preferred Opposition leader', which is pretty much what you'd expect Labour's pollster (although this was not a poll for Labour) to conclude. It's also reasonable to conclude that being preferred to Judith Collins as the preferred PM doesn't necessarily mean that those who preferred you to Judith actually want you to be the PM. As far as preferences go, another interpretation of the polling is that 88 percent\\u00a0of those polled don't want David Seymour as PM and 90 percent\\u00a0don't want Judith Collins as PM, plus or minus the margin of error of 3.1 percent. Nonetheless David Seymour was quick to see the upside. Although his libertarian outlook probably makes him philosophically opposed to the concept of gift horses, he wasn't going to look this one in the mouth. \\\"People want alternatives' he said. 'My job is to put those forward, and this will serve to make me work harder in that.\\\"\\u00a0He can be forgiven for the first-person focus of his response because he was, after all, 100 percent\\u00a0of all Act MPs from 2014 to 2020. He's now 10 percent\\u00a0of the current number of Act MPs, a fun fact that will earn you both a point and the pity of your fellow team members at your next pub quiz. And you should really try to get Jason Walls on your pub quiz team because we're not done with the clairvoyance of his write-up of Outrage Monday. In quoting Judith Collins' response to the Human Rights Commission $200 koha to the Mongrel Mob and the tenure of Human Rights Commissioner Paul Hunt he sourced an incredible piece of projection by Judith about Thursday's preferred PM poll - \\\"Hunt must go whether by his own resignation or not\\\" she thundered \\\"This farce cannot continue.' Give this quote a first-person makeover and it's the perfect projection on Monday for her polling rejection on Thursday. Have a peaceful weekend. And if you're going to spend some part of it pondering whether to pick England or Italy in the Euro football final on Monday morning it might pay to see what Jason Walls is predicting.

Hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket revenue will be lost, and that must be made up by the government. Fans have also endured months of uncertainty about whether the Olympics will go ahead.\\n\\\"Many people were looking forward to watching the games at the venues, but I would like everyone to fully enjoy watching the games on TV at home,\\\" Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said after the meeting. \\\"It's gut-wrenching because many people looked forward to watching at the venues.\\\"\\nFans from abroad were banned months ago, and the new measures will mean no spectators in stadiums and arenas around Tokyo \\u2014 both indoor and outdoor venues.\\n\\nJapan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. (Photo / AP)\\nThe state of emergency begins July 12 and runs through August 22. The Olympics, which open July 23 and run through August 8, fall entirely under the emergency period, while the Paralympics open August 24.\\n\\\"Taking into consideration the impact of the Delta strain, and in order to prevent the resurgence of infections from spreading across the country, we need to step up virus-prevention measures,\\\" Suga said.\\nIn principle, the July 23 opening ceremony at the new $1.4 billion National Stadium will be without paying fans, although some dignitaries, sponsors, IOC officials and others will be allowed to attend.\\n\\\"We will have to review the situation about the dignitaries and stakeholders,\\\" organising committee President Seiko Hashimoto said of the opening ceremony.\\n\\\"No fans was a very difficult decision.\\\"\\nHashimoto acknowledged some regrets, particularly about the decision coming so late.\\n\\\"We had no choice but to arrive at the no-spectator decision,\\\" she said. \\\"We postponed and postponed, one after another. I have done some soul-searching about that.\\\"\\nThe emergency declaration made for a rude arrival for IOC President Thomas Bach, who landed Thursday in Tokyo for the games. He attended the virtual meeting on fans from his five-star hotel for IOC officials where he was self-isolating for three days.\\n\\\"What can I say? Finally we are here,\\\" Bach said, sounding upbeat as he opened the late night meeting that ended close to midnight. \\\"I have been longing for this day for more than one year.\\\"\\nToshiro Muto, the CEO of the organising committee, said many sponsors, federation officials and others would be considered to be \\\"organisers\\\" and thus would be allowed to attend venues. He said some might occupy public seating, but he said he did not know \\\"the numerical details.\\\"\\n\\nTokyo Olympics Minister Tamayo Marukawa. (Photo / AP)\\nOrganisers had expected to generate about $800 million in ticket sales. Any shortfall \\u2014 and it could be almost the entire amount \\u2014 will have to be made up by Japanese government entities.\\nJapan is officially spending $15.4 billion on the Olympics, and several government audits say it's much larger. All but $6.7 billion is public money.\\nTwo weeks ago, organisers and the IOC allowed venues to be filled to 50% of capacity, with crowds not to exceed 10,000. The state of emergency forced the late turnaround, which was always an option if infections got worse.\\nOn Thursday, Tokyo reported 896 new cases, up from 673 a week earlier. It's the 19th straight day that cases have topped the mark set seven days prior. New cases on Wednesday hit 920, the highest total since 1,010 were reported on May 13.\\nThe main focus of the emergency is a request for bars, restaurants and karaoke parlours serving alcohol to close. A ban on serving alcohol is a key step to tone down Olympics-related festivities and keep people from drinking and partying. Tokyo residents are expected to face requests to stay home and watch the games on TV.\\n\\\"How to stop people enjoying the Olympics from going out for drinks is the main issue,\\\" Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said.\\n\\nPeople wearing face masks walk past the Olympics Rings statue in Tokyo. (Photo / AP)\\nThe rise in infections also has forced the Tokyo city government to pull the Olympic torch relay off the streets, allowing it only on remote islands off the capital's coast.\\n\\\"The infections are in their expansion phase and everyone in this country must firmly understand the seriousness of it,\\\" said Dr Shigeru Omi, a top government medical adviser.\\nHe urged authorities to take tough measures quickly ahead of the Olympics, with summer vacations approaching.\\nOmi has repeatedly called for a spectator ban, calling it \\\"abnormal\\\" to stage an Olympics during a pandemic.\\nA government Covid-19 advisory panel on Wednesday expressed concerns about the resurgence of infections.\\n\\\"Two-thirds of the infections in the capital region are from Tokyo, and our concern is the spread of the infections to neighboring areas,\\\" said Ryuji Wakita, director-general of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.\\nThe Olympics are pushing ahead against most medical advice, partially because the postponement stalled the IOC's income flow. It gets almost 75 per cent from selling broadcast rights, and estimates suggest it would lose $3 billion to $4 billion if the Olympics were canceled altogether.\\nAbout 11,000 Olympians and 4400 Paralympians are expected to enter Japan, along with tens of thousands of officials, judges, administrators, sponsors, broadcasters and media. The IOC says more than 80 per cent of Olympic Village residents will be vaccinated.\\nNationwide, Japan has had about 810,000 cases and nearly 14,900 deaths. Only 15 per cent of Japanese are fully vaccinated, still low compared with 47.4 per cent in the United States and almost 50 per cent in Britain.\\n- AP\",\n",

Never,\\\" said Rina Begum, 30, who came from a neighbouring town.Rani is 66 centimetres long and weighs only 26 kilograms but the owners say it is 10 centimetres shorter than the smallest cow in Guinness World Records.M A\\u00a0Hasan Howlader, manager of Shikor Agro farm, used a tape measure to show dozens of onlookers how Rani dwarfs her closest rival Manikyam, a cow in the Indian state Kerala that currently holds the world record.\\\"People come long distances despite the coronavirus lockdown. Most want to take selfies with Rani,\\\" Mr Howlader told AFP, adding Guinness World Records had promised a decision in three months.\\\"More than 15,000 people have come to see Rani in the past three days alone,\\\" he said.\\\"Honestly speaking, we are tired.\\\"Guinness World Records said Manikyam, from the Vechur breed, was 61 centimetres high in June 2014.Rani is a Bhutti, or Bhutanese, cow which is prized for its meat in Bangladesh.The other Bhuttis on the farm are twice Rani's size.\\\"We did not expect such huge interest. We did not think people would leave their homes because of the worsening virus situation. But they have come here in droves,\\\" the manager said.Sajedul Islam, the government's chief vet for the region, said Rani was a product of \\\"genetic inbreeding\\\" and was unlikely to become any bigger.Mr Islam said he had told the farm to restrict the tourist influx.\\\"I told them they should not allow so many people to crowd the farm. They may carry diseases here that threaten Rani's health,\\\" he said.AFP\",\n",

Instances had been reported by people over 70 years old.\\nNinety-five per cent of the victims were women.\\nCocker said the number of people criminally charged under the Act was in line with predictions, and by and large people were now aware of the offences under the Act.\\n\\\"Not many countries have, you know, covered the breadth of offending that Netsafe now does under regulation, but it is a incredibly complicated and very imperfect system for resolving harm so there's still a lot of work to be done.\\\"\\nWhere to get help:\\n\\u2022\\u00a00800 543 354 (0800 LIFELINE) or free text 4357 (HELP) (available 24/7)\\u2022\\u00a0https://www.lifeline.org.nz/services/suicide-crisis-helpline\\u2022\\u00a0YOUTHLINE: 0800 376 633\\u2022 NEED TO TALK?

      "      \"summary\": \"Source: The Conversation \\u2013 Africa \\u2013 By Kajsa Hallberg Adu, Researcher in Higher Education and Migration, KTH Royal Institute of Technology\\nGhanaian university students hope to return home after studies abroad Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\\n\\nA great many African countries had shown steady economic growth in the decade prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. But all have failed to adequately create opportunities for the young people in their countries. With growing youth populations, creating paths for education and employment is a make or break issue for the continent.\\nBut there's also good news. Many young people are getting access to secondary education and an increasing number also university education. An increasing share of youth in Africa are university students, 9% in 2018. \\nIn today's knowledge economy, university students carry a key role in development. They are therefore an important group to study and understand better. \\nIn Ghana, a country of 31 million inhabitants, 57% of the population is under 25. In 2019, 17% were enrolled in university compared to only 9% 10 years earlier. But local scholarship opportunities are few and increasingly individuals carry the costs of tuition. Nearly a third of 15-29-year-olds are not in education, employment or training. \\nExactly how many Ghanaians emigrate each year is not known. But United Nations data on Ghanaians abroad (excluding those who have naturalised) suggest about 970,000 live abroad. Historically many have been highly educated.\\nTo understand the aspirations of this generation of Ghanaian students I conducted a study on their migration aspirations and mobility. I surveyed 467 university students in the country.\\nMy study showed that the vast majority intended to go abroad for at least one year, and most also expressed a wish to study abroad. But a majority also said that they wanted to return home.\\nThis is an important insight. The young Ghanaians I studied expressed a preference to live in their home country. The students made it clear that they were not 'opting out' by migrating, but rather making deliberate plans to be able to contribute and build at home. \\nThis doesn't detract from the fact that there are high levels of frustration at the lack of opportunity and access to basic amenities in the country. This is clear from the current protests being conducted under the banner #FixTheCountry. Most of the conveners of the protests are recent graduates, or are still at university. \\nFrustrated youth\\nMany young people across the continent with higher education degrees are more likely to consider migration than the adult population as a whole. Ghana is typical of many African countries on this front. Its number of internationally mobile students is the closest to the African average of 5.8%.\\nSince 1992, Ghana has often been cited as beacon of hope for democracy in Africa and Ghanaians have seen a steady improvement of their living standards, including access to education. But these developments have not impressed young people who struggle with high levels of unemployment, weak representation in politics, as well as underemployment in non-secure, informal jobs. To some extent, this is also true of graduates.\\nThis frustration has reached new heights. Earlier this year young people took to social media under the hashtag #FixTheCountry. More recently they have taken to the streets. The street protests were sparked by the death of an activist, Ibrahim 'Macho Kaaka' Muhammad, who was murdered on 28 June 2021. He was a vocal critic of the local government in his community. Three suspects are currently in custody.\\nTo control the protests the military was called in. Two people were killed and scores of young people were injured. #FixTheCountry organiser Kaly Jay tweeted that: \\n\\nGhanaians have lost hope in the health system, education system, security system and more. Our roads and other facilities are in deplorable states. High cost of living and a high level of unemployment. But I can't shout #FixTheCountry because my life might be in danger.\\n\\nThe views of students\\nNine out of 10 students I surveyed said they intended to go abroad for more than one year. Most also said they intended to study abroad. One in seven said they intended to work. \\nNearly all the students in the survey \\u2013 98% \\u2013 said they would want to return to Ghana, with 29% saying they wanted to return within three years, 46% within six years and around 27% wanted to divide their time between Ghana and abroad. \\nThe high level of return by highly educated Ghanaian migrants is corroborated in other studies.\\nMy study also showed that migration was not an option for some students. One in 12 students (8%) said they were not interested in migrating at all. Reservations about migration included costs such as tuition fees (53%) and racism in the destination country (16%). One in four said 'patriotism' was a reason to stay. \\nAside from asking the students about their migration aspirations, I also asked what steps they had taken towards migration. A quarter said they had not discussed migration with anyone since starting university and about half had not taken any practical steps such as acquiring a passport or applying for a visa. \\nIncreasingly difficult migration regulations also reduced migration. Only 2% of the studied population had a valid visa and 6% said their applications had been denied. Countries students had applied to were the US, the UK, Canada, Europe (Schengen), Saudi Arabia and South Africa. \\nInsights\\nThe findings of my study showed Ghanaian students who aspired to migrate also aspired to return. Young people in Ghana crave better opportunities at home including university and graduate school with scholarship opportunities, and decent work in growth sectors like agro processing and tourism. \\nWhile the authorities consider their next move on the #FixTheCountry protest they should take note of the fact that university students are not 'opting out' by migrating. Rather they are making deliberate plans to be able to contribute and build at home. Taking note of the aspirations of university students, including their wish to stay or return swiftly, is a good start at fixing the country.

      "      \"summary\": \"Central Pulse's reign as ANZ Premiership netball champions could be over after suffering an agonising three-goal defeat to Mainland Tactix. Tactix goal shoot Ellie Bird scored twice inside the final 10 seconds to pull off a thrilling 52-49 win at Te Rauparaha Arena in Porirua on Friday night, keeping their playoff hopes alive and all but ending the two-time defending champions' dream of a three-peat. Effectively needing to win each of their remaining games to break into the top-three, the Pulse led on three occasions in what will go down as one of the games of the 2021 season, but were guilty of coughing up possession via a held ball while trailing by one. The Pulse pulled level at 49-49 with less than five minutes to play after goal shoot Aliyah Dunn scored back-to-back goals, including a spectacular effort while off-balance. Taking a pass from wing attack Whitney Souness, Dunn turned away from Tactix goal keep Jane Watson and threw up a miracle shot behind her shoulder while standing on one foot. The goal went in, and Dunn scored again to set up a grandstand finish but they were penalised for holding the ball for too long while under considerable pressure from the suffocating Tactix defence. Bird made the Pulse pay, scoring three times in the final 90 seconds, including twice in the final 10 seconds, to secure a vital victory. Mainland Tactix 52 (Ellie Bird 41/44, Te Paea Selby-Rickit 11/14) Central Pulse 49 (Aliyah Dunn 35/38, Te Amo Amaru Tibble 12/18, Ivana Rowland 2/2) Quarter scores: 12-14, 27-28, 40-38 Stuff MVP points: Samon Nathan, Aliyah Dunn, Ellie Bird\",\n",

While the New Zealand TAB only has odds on surfing at the Games available currently, leading worldwide oddsmaker Pinnacle has lines for most events to be contested in Tokyo, bar most athletics competitions. It has NZ favoured to win gold in seven events, with Lisa Carrington the shortest-priced favourite of the NZ team, offering $1.36 to win the women's K1 500m canoe sprint.Sarah Hirini and Hamish Bond will carry the New Zealand flag into the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony. The three-time Olympic medal winner is also favoured to win the K1 200m for the third successive Olympics at $1.48, while the NZ women's rugby sevens team will start hot favourites at $1.39 to claim the gold that eluded them in the final in Rio 2016. READ MORE: * Lisa Carrington to chase a swag of medals at Tokyo Olympics * New Zealand rowing eights set to end big boat medal drought at Tokyo Olympics Other NZ favourites for gold are the women's rowing eight ($2.07) and women's pair of Kerri Gowler and Grace Pendergast, who are also part of the eights squad, at $2.67. America's Cup victors Peter Burling and Blair Tuke are favoured to defend their men's 49er sailing gold from Rio, paying $1.45, while the NZ men's sevens team is favoured by one cent over Fiji at $3.28. Hubbard, who will become the first openly transgender athlete to compete at an Olympics, is the second favourite in the women's 87+kg category at $6.08, well behind hot favourite Li Wenwen of China at $1.13.New Zealand's Laurel Hubbard is among the medal favourites for the women's 87+kg event at the Tokyo Olympics. The Pinnacle oddsmakers have four NZ athletes or teams on the second line of betting, while seven Kiwi teams or competitors hold third favouritism ahead of the Games starting later this month. There were no lines posted for the women's and men's shot put, which should see the NZ duo of Dame Valerie Adams and Tom Walsh in medal contention, nor for equestrian events. Following the 2016 Rio Olympics where NZ won 18 medals \\u2013 the country's best result at an Olympics and four more than the target set by High Performance Sport NZ \\u2013 the Crown Agency responsible for oversight and leadership of the sport and recreation sector, Sport NZ, set a target of 16 or more medals for Tokyo.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Available rooms appear at random on the MIQ website and are booked on a first-come, first-served basis. Photo / RNZBy Jordan Bond for RNZA law professor says the managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) booking system may be discriminatory, as it is revealed tech-savvy people are able to game the system to increase their chances of booking a room.There is significant demand for the 4000 MIQ rooms.Currently, they are booked out until the end of November, but lately only about 75 per cent have been filled.Available rooms appear at random on the MIQ website and are booked on a first-come, first-served basis.One woman in her late 60s said she had no chance of being able to type her details in faster than a skilled computer user.Karen Thorp only has a mobile phone and no computer which makes it highly unlikely she'll be able to input her data faster than someone else. The rooms she does see available are quickly booked by someone else by the time she gets through the application process, rendering them unavailable.On top of this, one man has written an open coding script that alerts users immediately to any newly available room and auto-fills their details, giving them a valuable few seconds' advantage to book ahead of others.For those without moderate computer skills, this script would be hard to install and use.University of Otago law professor Andrew Geddis said the equality of the booking system may be an issue under the Bill of Rights Act.\\\"If in practice the system is creating a discriminatory effect because people just can't access the system as quickly as others, then that is breaching the Government's legal obligations. They have to allow everybody to have a genuinely equal chance of getting spots through the process they set up,\\\" Geddis said.\\\"Certainly if the system that the Government has set up is advantaging the abled over the disabled, or the younger over the older, that then raises questions under the Human Rights Act and the Bill of Rights Act of discrimination.\\\"A spokesperson for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) said the \\\"managed isolation allocation system is designed to give users equal opportunity to gain a voucher\\\".Otago University law professor Andrew Geddis said the equality of the booking system may be an issue under the Bill of Rights Act. Photo / RNZBut Geddis said questions of equality came down to perspective.\\\"An 'equal' system for someone who is completely computer literate - knows all the tricks, can access a computer system very quickly - is going to look very different to someone who doesn't have those advantages.\\\"So just saying 'we've set up a system that gives everyone the same chance' - it depends on who you're expecting to use this system, or does it actually give some people an advantage?\\\"Geddis said secondly, the system should perhaps be set up in a way that intentionally prioritised some over others.\\\"There may be some people who have stronger claims to get into MIQ than others. People who have essentially been locked out of New Zealand for months and months, thereby denied their right to return, probably have a stronger claim to return than someone who is maybe popping offshore for a trade show and wants to come back in a couple of weeks' time.\\\"Just saying 'we've set up an equal chance for everyone to get in' begs the question of: What does equality mean in this context? And actually, should it be an equal system? Or are there legal obligations for some people to be treated preferentially, to be given places because they've been locked out much longer than others?\\\"MBIE joint head of MIQ Megan Main said overall the booking system had performed \\\"extremely well and enables people to book spaces on a regular basis\\\".\\\"There are consistently a significant number of people on the MIQ voucher site searching for an available date and the reality is there is finite space in MIQ.\\\"If a room becomes available on the site but is no longer there after a short period of time, this is because another person has just booked it - there can be hundreds of people competing for rooms at the same time in periods of high demand.Main said the allocation system was designed to give everyone an equal opportunity for a room. \\\"The system allows third parties to book on behalf of people who feel less confident with technology, including travel agents and family members.\\\"As with all aspects of our Covid-19 response, we are continuing to review our policies and procedures to ensure they remain fit for purpose, and keep our wider community safe. That includes exploring options including waitlisting and working on ways to release as many spaces as practicable at appropriately spaced-out intervals.\\\"It should be noted that even with a form of waiting list, there would still be insufficient spaces to fulfil the demand to come to New Zealand.\\\"MBIE did not respond to Geddis' points that the system raises questions around discrimination under the Human Rights Act and Bill of Rights Act.The most recent MIQ data, from yesterday, showed 1130 rooms were empty of the 4000 available rooms, over 25 per cent.The number of MIQ rooms intentionally left empty as \\\"contingency\\\" increased from 400 to 900 at the opening of the transtasman bubble, while about 200 are unavailable because of hotel maintenance at the Grand Mercure and Grand Millennium.The ministry said others were unavailable as it changed the way returnees were grouped, and moved to a \\\"cohort\\\" intake system.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"A Wellington College pupil has been forced to find a new way to get to school after being bullied by a bus driver, who has refused to stop and pick him up. The boy's family made two complaints about the driver after he failed to stop, or failed to wait for the correct departure time, at the Wellington suburb of Kelburn.A Wellington College student's family says the bus driver failed to pick him up on Monday after the family made several complaints about him. The bus driver later aggressively confronted the 13-year-old, and threatened not to pick him up if the complaints continued, the family said. The boy's father approached RNZ because he felt NZ Bus, the company running the 741 bus service concerned, was not dealing with the problem appropriately, particularly in light of another RNZ story from last month in which a 10-year-old girl was dumped in an unfamiliar suburb by a NZ Bus driver, after she missed her stop at Queen Margaret College.A Wellington bus driver dumped a 10-year-old girl in an unfamiliar suburb in the pouring rain, after failing to drop her at school. READ MORE: * Wellington no longer at front of line for national public transport card as launch planned for Canterbury * Shorter symphonies could be the answer to parking limits * Wellington to temporarily suspend bus services during rush hour as driver shortages, cancellations drag on * Thousands sign petition in support of striking Wellington bus drivers The father, who wished to remain anonymous, said his son has had issues with the bus service on and off since the school year started. The bus is meant to leave his Kelburn stop at 8.19am, and the boy routinely arrives up to five minutes early. But even then, sometimes he missed the bus as it had already come and gone, sometimes leaving the stop more than 11 minutes early. \\\"Him missing the bus and being late to school was no fault of his own,\\\" his father said. \\\"It was primarily the bus arriving earlier than the scheduled arrival time, and it is my understanding that if the bus arrives early it is incumbent on the bus driver to wait at the bus stop and leave at the scheduled departure time and that has not been happening.\\\" There have also been times where the driver simply has not picked up the teenager, even though the bus has not been full. The boy's parents recently lodged complaints with Metlink on both counts, and were told that the driver had been talked to about being more reliable. But after two complaints, the driver vented his anger at the boy. \\\"There were three students waiting at the bus stop, one of which was my son. The bus driver confronted the three students asking who was responsible for the complaints, and my son said it was him. \\\"At that point the bus driver, I understand, quite aggressively expressed his displeasure, and threatened my son that if any more complaints were made against him, the bus driver, then he would not let him on the bus.\\\"Commuters on a Wellington bus (file photo). Dressed down in front of his peers, the boy felt humiliated and bullied by the driver, and unsure if he still wanted to use the bus service. His parents told Metlink about the exchange in a complaint last week. When the boy next attempted to take the bus, on Monday of this week, the driver followed through on his threat and drove straight past his stop. \\\"I'm not sure whether there was room on the bus for my son, but the bus driver made no attempt to stop and explain to my son if there wasn't any room that he couldn't uplift him,\\\" the father said. \\\"My son, however, felt that there was plenty of space for him to stand. Even though there was no sitting room, there was certainly standing room. The bus driver blew straight past.\\\" The father again complained, but he does not think NZ Bus took the complaints seriously. The driver should be taken off the route and at the very least placed onto a different route, and not allowed to continue bullying his son, he said. He took buses on alternative routes or was driven to school by his parents this week, but attempted to use the bus on route 741 on Friday morning. RNZ was there with him as he waited for the bus. The bus arrived more than five minutes early, and the boy had to run to get on it before it pulled away. The driver closed the doors as the boy was approaching and briefly started to pull away, but then stopped to let him on. He left the stop five minutes before the scheduled departure of 8.19am.The wearing of masks on public transport is currently mandatory. In a statement, Metlink's general manager Scott Gallacher said he was sorry to hear of the family's concerns, and was looking forward to a positive resolution. \\\"We cannot comment on the details of this case however as the investigation is still proceeding,\\\" Gallacher said. \\\"What I can say is that we expect all staff throughout the Metlink network to treat customers fairly and with respect. \\\"Where we discover that is not the case we raise the issue with our operators and expect them to act on maintaining high standards of behaviour.\\\" RNZ understands disciplinary action has been taken against the driver, but he continues to drive. NZ Bus said it could not comment while an investigation was underway. Meanwhile, the driver of the 741 bus this morning, as well as many other bus drivers on the route through Kelburn, were seen not wearing masks. Gallacher said wearing of a face covering is mandatory on public transport unless the person has an exemption, for example, for medical reasons.RNZ\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Lucas Armstrong used to walk their\\u200b school corridors with a lowered gaze, afraid of appearing 'different' to other students. With their\\u200b school in the midst of allegations of toxic masculine culture and sexual assault, they decided it was time for change. Armstrong and fellow student Thomas Semple, both 17, were part of a small group at Christchurch Boys' High School who formed a Queer-Straight Alliance (QSA) group last term. 'It's been a long time coming,' Semple said. READ MORE: * Christchurch girls school students seek end to abuse after revealing harassment and rape * Student praised for taking stand against 'inappropriate' behaviour by young men * Students pushing for better education around sex, consent and rape culture Semple got involved with the QSA after Christchurch Girls' High students chalked his school with messages of support for the LGBTQIA+ community and women, and more than 100 Girls' High students protested in March. He believed students needed 'better representation and support'. Armstrong, who came out as bisexual last year, said they spent much of their junior years not wanting to be part of the rainbow community because they knew it meant they were 'different' and feared being ostracised. They and Semple both felt it was difficult to change their 140-year-old school's values, but they did not want younger students to feel like they were not supported. They believed issues like homophobia and transphobia were linked to the students' treatment of women. Christchurch Girls' High students attempted to lead a sexual harassment protest against a neighbouring boys' school earlier this year, but were turned back. (Video first published May 2021). A recent survey at Girls' High revealed more than half of the 725 respondents said they had been sexually harassed, and 20 alleged they had been raped. Many incidents involved young males at social events, on the street, or on public transport. A Girls' High student involved in Culture CHCHange \\u2013 a group fighting rape culture and sexual harassment \\u2013 said the problems were not confined to one school, but they\\u200b viewed Boys' High and Christ College as 'the main problem'. The group had planned to protest at the annual Christ College and Boys' High rugby game in June, but cancelled it after being sent threatening messages by students allegedly from the schools. Armstrong and Semple decided to take action after accusations of sexual assault by students at the school were increasingly voiced by Christchurch Girls' High students. 'The culture of the school is in the boys and that's what needs to change,' Semple said. The managing director of rainbow charity InsideOUT, Tabby Besley, said groups like QSAs challenged the idea that there was 'only one way to be a man'. 'Those groups have a real power because it's about changing the school culture of that place.' There had been a rise in schools starting rainbow diversity groups over the last 10 years, often with students leading the change, she said.InsideOUT managing director Tabby Besley says QSA groups have increased in schools around New Zealand and often help make a school's culture more inclusive. (File photo) 'Well over a third of secondary schools' in New Zealand were estimated to have some form of rainbow support group, she said. A 2019 survey revealed 17 per cent of students at New Zealand secondary schools identified as part of the rainbow community. 'For every young person, their human right is for schools to be a safe space where they can be themselves, so by having a rainbow group, it shows those students that they're valued and celebrated.' Armstrong said the QSA group, which met weekly, had support from several prefects and teachers, and its events had been 'quite a success'.The students hope the QSA will continue after they leave high school. (File photo) 'The general culture of the school is accepting of the QSA but the underlying ... Christchurch Boys' High School culture still feels alienating,' they said. The group ran several events over Pride Week at the end of June, and raised more than $300 at a bingo event. A pride flag was flown next to the main flag on the school grounds, which was a big step, they said. Speeches were also given by Armstrong, Semple and fellow student Carlos Knight, who called out fellow students over unacceptable catcalling, transphobia and homophobia. 'The change we've made this year has been quite realisable,' Armstrong said. The QSA aims to create a more inclusive, accepting environment for all students at Christchurch Boys' High School. (File photo) One of their biggest focuses would be finding ways for the QSA to continue after they finished high school this year. 'Once we go, we'd still really love for it to keep going for younger generations of Boys' High boys,' Semple said. 'It's about making the school more diverse and not preparing people for the past, but actually for the future ... because the world is diverse.'\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Opinion - The All Blacks' second test of the year is kicking off on Saturday night and we'll be welcoming a new captain to the list of men that have led the side.\\nAaron Smith gets the honour in his 98th test match, which is a nice gesture but really does make you wonder what may have happened if he'd been given the job full-time.\\n\\n\\n\\nAaron Smith \\nPhoto: Photosport / Andrew Cornaga\\n\\n\\nNow, this is not a gripe at Samuel Whitelock, who has stepped in for the injured Sam Cane till presumably some time during the Rugby Championship.\\nWhitelock was the predictable choice given he'd done the job before, was likely to be on the park for the duration of all the big games, and has 123 tests worth of experience. But that's kind of the issue with the All Blacks, indeed with rugby in New Zealand right now - it's predictable.\\nIt was predictable that NZ Rugby chose Ian Foster to be the coach, it was predictable that Stewart Mitchell would be elected chairman, it was predictable that the All Blacks would hang 102 unanswered points on Tonga last weekend. It was even predictable that Foster would make 13 changes to his side from that test, because he was allowed to pick a 36-man squad.\\nThis conservative mindset isn't such a bad thing to a great many who follow rugby here and NZ Rugby knows this. But the naming of Smith as captain shows that he does indeed have the respect of the team as one of its most influential players, plus it completes a pretty remarkable redemption arc (at least in All Black terms).\\nSmith has become far more of a go to mouthpiece for the game of late, is active on social media, and would be counted as one of the most popular players among fans. But picking him as the proper stand in for Cane was just a bridge too far, it seems.\\nWhile that would have been nice, it won't make a difference to the score on Saturday night. The Fijians should pose more of a challenge than Tonga, although they have only had a few days to prepare given they've just come out of managed isolation.\\nWhat sort of crowd will be taking money out of their pockets to sit and watch that at Forsyth Barr Stadium remains to be seen and will probably be of concern to both NZ Rugby. They have known full well that it'd be a struggle to fill up the seats while also struggling to convince anyone that these games are actually doing anyone other than the All Black coaching staff any good, therefore undermining the holding of them in the first place.\\nBut at least they can count on some sort of crowd showing up, which is not an option for what was supposed to be the most notable rugby event of the year. Over in South Africa, the British & Irish Lions tour is one step away from being an absolute disaster, with a match postponed and positive Covid-19 tests in both test squads, all the while being played in front of empty stands as the country deals with another outbreak.\\nIt must be galling for the Lions players to be watching the Euro 2020 tournament and seeing 60,000 in the stands at Wembley celebrating England's semifinal win, given that relocating the tour to the UK was one of the possible work-arounds.\\nThe ramifications of the test series going pear-shaped would have an effect here, too. The Springboks are using this series as a very intense way of crash starting their programme after not playing a test since the 2019 Rugby World Cup final (they did have a hit out against Georgia last weekend, with the second test in that series called off), which means if the unthinkable happens and the test series is called off, they will come to New Zealand without any real preparation for the much-hyped 100th test match against the All Blacks.\\nThat fixture now looms as the biggest game of the year, given the Lions series may well end up being a complete damp squib. Let's just hope the old enemy gets a chance to tune up before they collide with the All Blacks on 25 September.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"They were the games of the 2020/21 A-League campaign that turned heads, flipped scripts\\u00a0and provided the fans\\u00a0in the stands with\\u00a0\\\"I was there\\\" moments to cherish. Read on as a-league.com.au\\u00a0looks back on ten of the most memorable fixtures served up throughout 24 entertaining Matchweeks in the 2020/21 A-League campaign! Matchweek 19: Western Sydney Wanderers 3-2 Sydney FC \\\"It's a famous night at Bankwest. Scott McDonald on his debut with what proves the match-winner. A five-goal thriller to resurrect the Wanderers' finals hopes.\\\" A berth in the\\u00a0Finals Series wasn't to eventuate for Western Sydney by the end of 2020/21, much to the disappointment of a club with high expectations heading into the season. But in Matchweek 19,\\u00a0Wanderers fans dared to dream after a 3-2 Sydney Derby triumph in front of a vibrant crowd packed into Bankwest Stadium. More than 20,000 fans filled the stands to watch the home side try and stop the rot, having gone six games without a win heading into the clash with Sydney FC. The Sky Blues\\u00a0hadn't lost for six games heading into the Sydney Derby, and they wouldn't lose for seven more in the games that followed. But on the first night of May, the Wanderers served up a performance to remember to extend their unbeaten run against the Sky Blues to six games.\\u00a0 The five-goal contest\\u00a0saw the brilliant Bruce Kamau open the scoring, before the Duke of Parramatta doubled the advantage. Alex Wilkinson found a rare goal early in the second half for the Sky Blues, but Scott McDonald made it 3-1 down the other end just minutes after emerging from the bench in his first appearance for the Red and Black.\\u00a0 Trent Buhagiar won the visitors a penalty in the 83rd minute, which Bob\\u00f4 blasted high over the bar - much to the delight of the home fans. A manic finish was to follow, as Anthony Caceres combined with Milo\\u0161 Ninkovi\\u0107 to burst into the box and tee Bob\\u00f4 up to find his 50th goal in A-League history\\u00a0from close range. Caceres thundered a late shot from outside the box off the crossbar as the Sky Blues tried desperately to salvage a point, but it was too little, too late for the eventual Grand Finalists as the Wanderers won out on a memorable night at Bankwest Stadium. Western Sydney Wanderers 3-2 Sydney FC | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 22: Wellington Phoenix 3-0 Western United \\\"There's no place like home for the Wellington Phoenix... Lewis, Piscopo and Hemed all on the scoresheet. 24,000-plus delirious fans,\\u00a0Wellington Phoenix three, Western United nil.\\\" 433 days after the last playing\\u00a0on home soil, Wellington Phoenix returned to Sky Stadium to beat\\u00a0Western United 3-0 in front of a record-breaking crowd at Sky Stadium in Matchweek 22. Wellington's biggest-ever home crowd for a regular season fixture flocked to see their side in the flesh for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic saw the 'Nix base themselves in New South Wales to ensure both the 2019/20 and 2020/21 A-League campaigns could go ahead.\\u00a0 The sacrifices made by the New Zealand outfit produced plenty of challenges and hardships throughout the season. It's what made their return across the ditch even sweeter when a travel bubble between the two A-League countries allowed the Phoenix to arrange two\\u00a0fixtures to be held in Wellington and Aukland before the end of the 2020/21 campaign. The first of which came\\u00a0at Sky Stadium, and the performance of the home side combined with the passion pouring out of an\\u00a0emotionally-charged crowd made for an unforgettable occasion in Wellington. Clayton Lewis, Reno Piscopo and Tomer Hemed were the scorers for the Phoenix on that special day in May. Wellington Phoenix 3-0 Western United | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 18: Central Coast Mariners 2-2 Sydney FC \\\"The points are split on a pulsating night on the Central Coast.\\\" Second on the table and gunning to remain in the hunt for the Premiers Plate, Central Coast Mariners hosted the surging\\u00a0Sky Blues in front of the biggest home crowd pulled by the Gosford side throughout the regular season.\\u00a0 It seemed the Mariners faithful were in for a treat when goals to Marco Ure\\u00f1a and Matt Simon scored to put the home side two goals up in the first half, before Sydney put on a comeback effort inspired by Ninkovi\\u0107's inventive volley scored off the outside of his right foot in the dying embers of the first half.\\u00a0 The Sky Blues saw a second-half equaliser ruled out by VAR, and Andrew Redmayne denied Ure\\u00f1a a sealer down the other end with a strong save soon after before Buhagiar got Sydney back on level terms with less than ten minutes to play. After the game Alen Stajcic said it was the most alive he's felt at an A-League ground throughout his two-year stint as head coach of the Mariners, as he and the 10,000-strong crowd were treated to a classic encounter between two teams desperate for points.\\u00a0 Central Coast Mariners 2-2 Sydney FC | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 10: Melbourne Victory 3-4 Western United \\\"A chance here to win it - SANCHEZ...\\u00a0Western United do claim the three points in the final seconds!\\\" The ultimate display of last-gasp drama occurred in Matchweek 10 when Western United pipped Melbourne Victory to the post in an intense instalment of the Battle of the Bridge at Marvel Stadium. Victor S\\u00e1nchez scored three goals throughout 2020/21 for Western United. Two of those strikes\\u00a0came on February 27 against Victory, with the second rippling the back of the net in the sixth minute of additional time to grant the Green and Black a 4-3 win. S\\u00e1nchez had scored the goal to take the two sides into the half-time break level at 1-1 after Callum McManaman's opener\\u00a0for Victory. United then pulled ahead through a quick-fire Besart Berisha brace in the second stanza. Up 3-1 and cruising, United conceded to Jacob Butterfield before Tomislav Uskok earned a second booking for the half to reduce his side to ten men for the final half-hour of play. Rudy Gestede netted a towering header in the 82nd minute to draw Victory level and send the home fans wild - but instead of watching their side go\\u00a0on to clinch all three points, the Victory faithful were to watch it all fall apart down the other end as S\\u00e1nchez popped up in the right place at the right time to score the ultimate heartbreaker.\\u00a0 Melbourne Victory 3-4 Western United | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 17: Melbourne City 7-0 Melbourne Victory \\\"An historic night, the 34th Melbourne Derby sees Jamie Maclaren score five... It's elation for City and humiliation for the Victory, who cop seven for the first time in A-League history.\\\" In the moments before kick-off in Matchweek 17's Melbourne Derby, Melbourne City fans held aloft signs displaying the number '6' to remind their opponents, Melbourne Victory, of City's 6-0 romp in the same fixture earlier in the 2020/21 campaign. Little did they know their side were about to go one better on an unforgettable night at AAMI Park. The contest was all but over by half-time after Andrew Nabbout and Jamie Maclaren scored on either side of Victory defender Adama Traor\\u00e9's straight red card on 30 minutes. But after the break City put on a relentless display, with Maclaren bagging four more and Adri\\u00e1n Luna putting the icing on the cake of a 7-0 rout.\\u00a0 City's combined score of 13 goals to nil against Victory across the first two Melbourne Derby fixtures in 2020/21 signalled a seismic shift in Victoria as City went on to claim the Premiership/Championship double and Victory slumped to a club-first wooden spoon. Melbourne City 7-0 Melbourne Victory | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 7: Central Coast Mariners 3-2 Western United \\\"Burgess was casual, Nigro took it off him, Bouman looking immediately for KUOL... can you believe it? It's 3-2, he's got a brace off the bench, and it's 3-2 to Central Coast, on top turning it around again!\\\" Mariners young gun\\u00a0Alou Kuol was an unstoppable force in the early stages of the 2020/21 campaign, as the teenage sensation scored six of his seven goals in his first nine appearances. In Matchweek 7 Kuol's impact was as lethal as ever, as he emerged from the bench to haul the Mariners back from the brink in a magnificent comeback win over Western United.\\u00a0 It was the second time in as many games the Mariners were to secure a comeback 3-2 win. With the score at 2-1 in United's favour, Stajcic introduced Kuol to the action with 30 minutes to play. His first goal drew the Mariners level at 2-2 before the energetic forward caused scenes of elation in the stands at Central Coast Stadium with an emphatic headed finish to Daniel Bouman's cross, sealing a 3-2 win for his red-hot side.\\u00a0 Central Coast Mariners 3-2 Western United | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 5: Western United 5-4 Perth Glory \\\"That is the end, the end of an extraordinary game of A-League football.\\u00a0It will go down as a classic. Western United with their first win of the season over a gallant Perth Glory.\\\" After emerging 5-3 victors in their first game of the campaign, Perth Glory travelled to face Western United in Matchweek 5 eager to keep the goalscoring momentum rolling.\\u00a0 The Western Australian side managed exactly that, scoring four more against United. But\\u00a0the defensive cracks remained, got bigger, and ultimately cost Richard Garcia's side the points in a manic 5-4 defeat.\\u00a0 United boss Mark Rudan admitted post-match he turned to Garcia during the game to say \\\"this is crazy\\\" as the two coaches shared a laugh as the mayhem unfolded.\\u00a0 There was only one goal scored in the first 56 minutes of play, through United's Victor S\\u00e1nchez, before chaos ensued in the final half-hour. Carlo Armiento and Bruno Fornaroli scored to put Perth 2-1 up, then Dylan Pieras netted a four-minute double off the bench to wrestle momentum back in United's favour. Nicholas D'Agostino levelled it up at 3-3, then Tomoki Imai and Armiento exchanged blows to take it to 4-4 at the 78-minute mark. Steven Lustica was the match-winner in the end, scoring the ninth goal of the game in the 84th minute as United won out 5-4. Western United 5-4 Perth Glory | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek\\u00a012: Western Sydney Wanderers 4-3 Wellington Phoenix \\\"What an amazing game of football at Bankwest Stadium.\\\" A seven-goal spectacle capped off by a pair of goals of the highest order unfolded at Bankwest Stadium in Matchweek 12 as Western Sydney outlasted the Phoenix in a 4-3 affair.\\u00a0 The two sides took to Bankwest Stadium on a Monday evening in March to serve up one of the games of the season which will be forever remembered for Cameron Devlin's thunderous strike for Wellington and Mitchell Duke's chest and volley down the other end which won Goal of Matchweek 12 honours. The Phoenix pulled ahead on three occasions in the contest, but the Wanderers found the answer on every occasion. With the score locked at 3-3 after 66 minutes of play the away side ran out of ways to try and kill off the resilient Red and Black, leaving the hosts to capitalise on their ability to find an answer to every question posed of them to find the decisive finish through Kwame Yeboah in the 84th minute, winning out 4-3 at Bankwest Stadium. Western Sydney Wanderers 4-3 Wellington Phoenix | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 15: Welllington Phoenix 2-3 Melbourne City \\\"A beautiful header from Marco Tilio, off the bench to put City back in front.\\u00a0Wonderfully created, superbly executed, and Melbourne City lead 3-2.\\\" Marco Tilio's match-winning display in Melbourne City's 3-2 win over Wellington Phoenix in Matchweek 15 was the moment that sparked the creative teenager's end-of-season form and stirring run toward playing a key role in City's Championship push. Tilio was\\u00a0given just 206 minutes of playing time in his first 12 games of the season as an\\u00a0attack fronted by star man Maclaren dominated the league. But the tide began to turn for Tilio after the 19-year-old scored three minutes into his cameo off the bench against Wellington in Matchweek 15 to decide a see-sawing contest in his side's favour. City twice took the lead throughout the game, and Wellington twice found the leveller as both Hemed and D\\u00e1vila scored equalising goals at WIN\\u00a0Stadium, Wellington's home away from home in Wollongong.\\u00a0 But the all-important fifth goal was to come off Tilio's head, assisted by a cross whipped in by Scott Galloway after Stefan Colakovski - who would also see his minutes increase in the latter stages of the season - set up the chance with tenacious play down the right-hand side of City's attack. Wellington Phoenix 2-3 Melbourne City | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 23: Wellington Phoenix 2-2 Perth Glory \\\"An absolute thriller at Eden Park ends in a stalemate...an absolutely scintillating encounter in the A-League. Both sides desperate for three points, both have to be content in a share. \\\" Wellington's late push for a spot\\u00a0in\\u00a0the\\u00a02020/21 Finals Series ultimately hinged on a missed penalty from captain D\\u00e1vila in the 90th minute of a thrilling 2-2 draw in the second of two Phoenix matches in New Zealand to end the season. Instead of clinching all three points at Eden Park, the 'Nix had to settle for a share of the spoils. Wellington went on to fall just one point short of a spot in the post-season after a win over Macarthur FC on the final day of the season.\\u00a0 But before D\\u00e1vila's penalty miss in minute 90, an enthralling contest between two evenly-matched sides played out in front of 22,233 fans in Aukland. Wellington took the lead through Tomer Hemed in the first half, then\\u00a0the away side turned it all around after the break. Bruno Fornaroli netted the equaliser, leaving Callum Timmins to blast Perth ahead with one of the goals of the season dispatched\\u00a0from distance into the top-right corner. Jaushua Sotirio came off the bench to make his mark with an 80th minute equaliser, leaving D\\u00e1vila with the opportunity to be the hero after Nick D'Agostino bundled Devlin over in the box.\\u00a0 It was an opportunity missed by D\\u00e1vila - a \\\"what if?\\\" moment in a brave campaign\\u00a0by the New Zealand outfit.

      "      \"summary\": \"Western Australia is threatening to tighten restrictions for coronavirus-plagued NSW even further, including potentially reducing compassionate exemptions.Premier Mark McGowan says strengthening the border could be necessary after NSW endured the worst day of its current outbreak, recording 44 new cases.WA's recent four-day lockdown was traced to a woman who contracted the highly transmissible Delta variant while holidaying in Sydney.\\\"We can't forget what we've been through here over the past fortnight has a direct link to the Bondi outbreak,\\\" Mr McGowan told reporters on Friday.\\\"Each day it looks like the situation in Sydney is increasingly dire.\\\"Of course our thoughts are with everyone in Sydney ... but the risk from this recent outbreak is all too dangerous.\\\"NSW is currently classed by WA as a medium-risk jurisdiction, denying entry to anyone who cannot secure highly-restricted exemptions.Mr McGowan - whose parents live in Sydney - said officials would review the border arrangements to see if they could be further tightened, including exemptions on compassionate grounds.\\\"Ordinarily it's returning West Australians coming home who might have gone to NSW for a short period of time,\\\" he said.\\\"If that particular category had to be tightened further in the circumstances we face, that's what we'd look at doing.\\\"WA recorded no new cases on Friday.Perth and the Peel region are slated to return to pre-lockdown life at 1201am on Monday, removing all existing restrictions.More than 15,400 small businesses affected by the lockdown will be eligible for $3000 grants.About 2300 tourism and hospitality businesses in regional WA who missed out on visitors just prior to the school holidays can also apply.The Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA had called for grants of up to $6000.\\\"On a per-day basis of lockdown, (the grants are) more generous than those put in place in NSW, Victoria and Queensland,\\\" Mr McGowan said.The premier said 55 people who attended Geraldton Hospital at the same time as an infected ship crewman were now classed as casual contacts.Of those, 46 have so far returned negative tests.Genomic testing has revealed the crewman, who spent up to three hours in the emergency department before being moved to a negative pressure room, has the Delta variant.The man in his 50s was airlifted to Perth and remains in a stable condition in intensive care at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.Staff, patients and visitors in the ED were initially told they would not have to isolate.That decision was reversed on Thursday following a meeting between government and health officials, despite the premier describing the risk of transmission as \\\"minuscule\\\".Upon returning a negative test, staff members will be allowed to return to work but must wear face masks at all times.Mr McGowan said the crewman \\\"probably would have died\\\" if his ship, which has since departed, hadn't been allowed to unload him for treatment at Geraldton.He was hospitalised in Geraldton, 420km north of Perth, after falling ill while aboard an empty bulk carrier over the weekend.The MV Emerald Indah has since departed for Indonesia after being blocked from docking near Perth.A separate staff member at the hospital is required to quarantine for 14 days after entering a lift used by the infected crewman.Authorities say the vaccinated staff member was sent home to isolate immediately and didn't have any contact with the community.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Crown Resorts has claimed it could default on hefty debts impacting thousands of innocent employees if its Melbourne licence is not renewed.The company's Victorian operation, under the microscope of a royal commission into whether it can retain a licence, wrote a letter to the state government last week requesting a meeting to discuss its commercial affairs.In hearings just a day earlier, the gaming giant's executive chair Helen Coonan was grilled about the July 2 letter from Crown's external lawyer Arnold Bloch Leibler to Consumer Affairs, Gaming and Liquor Regulation Minister Melissa Horne.Commissioner Ray Finkelstein said a \\\"plain English\\\" reading of the letter was that Crown was seeking to \\\"make sure that the commission doesn't make a particular finding\\\".Ms Coonan denied the company was trying to pre-empt or interfere with the royal commission.A redacted version of the letter made public on Friday revealed the gaming giant had told Ms Horne of the \\\"consequences for Crown and stakeholders\\\" that would arise from a negative outcome of the commission.\\\"It is not in the public interest for Crown to fail,\\\" the letter written by law firm partner Leon Zwier said.Crown is the state's largest single-site private employer with just under 12,000 employees, most of whom have not contributed to the failures of the company, it said.\\\"Through COVID-10 (employees) have suffered significant uncertainties. They will suffer greater uncertainties if there is an EOD (event of default).\\\"An EOD may also provide potential overseas suitors an opportunity to take advantage of the situation.\\\"Crown told the minister that a negative finding against it could result in defaulting on debts worth $700 million.This would have \\\"severe consequences\\\" for Crown and all its stakeholders, the company said, including shareholders, employees, unions, trade creditors, patrons and the hotel precinct and Melbourne tourism industry.Crown Resorts has received takeover offers from The Star entertainment group, which owns venues in Sydney, the Gold Coast and Brisbane, as well as US private investment firms Oaktree Capital and the Blackstone Group.Any suitor will want a guarantee that Crown's casino licence is not suspended, the letter stated.The company told the consumer affairs minister that it acknowledged the commission's role in \\\"shedding light on prior failures of culture, systems and people\\\" so that such failings are not repeated.It said it would consider terminating employment of any executives or employees that the royal commission makes adverse findings against.Friday marks the final day of eight weeks of hearings into the casino operator, in which more than 60 witnesses have given evidence.The hearings have covered failings and lack of compliance of the Melbourne casino, including that only 12 staff were employed to ensure an estimated 64,000 daily visitors gambled responsibly.It also emerged that Crown had underpaid gaming taxes by the millions, though two letters made public by the commission on Friday stated Crown had underpaid by $8.8 million - not $272.6 million as previously reported.\\\"It is Crown's intention to pay our estimation of the amount owing, together with penalty interest,\\\" chief executive officer Steve McCann wrote to both the gaming regulator and the Department of Treasury and Finance on July 1.Commissioner Ray Finkelstein is expected to deliver a final report detailing his findings and recommendations by October 15.His inquiry centred on Crown's Melbourne operations follows the Bergin inquiry in NSW, which in February found Crown unfit to run a casino at its Barangaroo complex in Sydney.Separately, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation (VCGLR) on Friday confirmed that an independent investigation will examine serious criminal allegations at Melbourne's Crown Casino.The allegations, made by former inspectors of the casino, will be investigated by prominent QC Ian Freckelton.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"West Coast defender Jeremy McGovern says every player in the team has put their hand up to take responsibility for last week's humiliating loss to Sydney, but insists the club isn't in crisis mode.The Eagles have been publicly battered since they followed up a home 55-point loss to the Bulldogs with a 92-point shellacking at the hands of the Swans last week.The defeats have all but killed off West Coast's chances of snaring a top-four berth, making it highly unlikely they'll be a legitimate premiership threat come finals time.McGovern revealed the player group sat down this week for a heart-to-heart chat in which every player owned up to letting the team down.\\\"All the boys put their hands up who haven't performed, and everyone did,\\\" McGovern said.\\\"There wasn't one bloke in there who put their hand up and said 'I've been 100 per cent all year'.\\\"We don't really need to get the sledgehammer out and whack blokes.\\\"But we sit down and we educate. We talk about it. We own up to it. That was probably the first thing.\\\"McGovern said there was still plenty of belief within the squad and not all was lost given West Coast are still inside the top eight.\\\"It's definitely not crisis talks or alarm bells going off completely,\\\" McGovern said.\\\"But we had to have a few chats to a few boys and we all had to look at each other individually.\\\"I'm obviously a leader of the footy club as well, so I'll put my hand up. I've had efforts and parts in games that I haven't contributed.\\\"West Coast will be aiming to rebound when they take on wooden spoon favourites North Melbourne at Optus Stadium on Monday night.McGovern said rather than make wholesale changes to the game plan, the playing group is determined to display a better work rate and also speed up their ball movement.\\\"It's pretty hard to fully reinvent your game plan at this part of the year,\\\" he said.\\\"We've had to tweak a few things, look at a few things. But it's not reinvent the whole wheel.\\\"The Eagles will be boosted by the return of Andrew Gaff (thumb) and Liam Ryan (suspension).But defender Alex Witherden appears set for another long stint on the sidelines after his groin injury flared up.Witherden missed almost two months earlier this season with what the club thought was the early stages of osteitis pubis, and the issue will be investigated further before a timeline is set on his return.Midfielder Jack Redden is set to miss two to three weeks with a minor leg fracture, while forward Jamaine Jones (syndesmosis) has been ruled out for six weeks.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Crown Resorts has claimed it could default on hefty debts impacting thousands of innocent employees if its Melbourne licence is not renewed.The company's Victorian operation, under the microscope of a royal commission into whether it can retain a licence, wrote a letter to the state government last week requesting a meeting to discuss its commercial affairs.In hearings just a day earlier, the gaming giant's executive chair Helen Coonan was grilled about the July 2 letter from Crown's external lawyer Arnold Bloch Leibler to Consumer Affairs, Gaming and Liquor Regulation Minister Melissa Horne.Commissioner Ray Finkelstein said a \\\"plain English\\\" reading of the letter was that Crown was seeking to \\\"make sure that the commission doesn't make a particular finding\\\".Ms Coonan denied the company was trying to pre-empt or interfere with the royal commission.A redacted version of the letter made public on Friday revealed the gaming giant had told Ms Horne of the \\\"consequences for Crown and stakeholders\\\" that would arise from a negative outcome of the commission.\\\"It is not in the public interest for Crown to fail,\\\" the letter written by law firm partner Leon Zwier said.Crown is the state's largest single-site private employer with just under 12,000 employees, most of whom have not contributed to the failures of the company, it said.\\\"Through COVID-10 (employees) have suffered significant uncertainties. They will suffer greater uncertainties if there is an EOD (event of default).\\\"An EOD may also provide potential overseas suitors an opportunity to take advantage of the situation.\\\"Crown told the minister that a negative finding against it could result in defaulting on debts worth $700 million.This would have \\\"severe consequences\\\" for Crown and all its stakeholders, the company said, including shareholders, employees, unions, trade creditors, patrons and the hotel precinct and Melbourne tourism industry.Crown Resorts has received takeover offers from The Star entertainment group, which owns venues in Sydney, the Gold Coast and Brisbane, as well as US private investment firms Oaktree Capital and the Blackstone Group.Any suitor will want a guarantee that Crown's casino licence is not suspended, the letter stated.The company told the consumer affairs minister that it acknowledged the commission's role in \\\"shedding light on prior failures of culture, systems and people\\\" so that such failings are not repeated.It said it would consider terminating employment of any executives or employees that the royal commission makes adverse findings against.Friday marks the final day of eight weeks of hearings into the casino operator, in which more than 60 witnesses have given evidence.The hearings have covered failings and lack of compliance of the Melbourne casino, including that only 12 staff were employed to ensure an estimated 64,000 daily visitors gambled responsibly.It also emerged that Crown had underpaid gaming taxes by the millions, though two letters made public by the commission on Friday stated Crown had underpaid by $8.8 million - not $272.6 million as previously reported.\\\"It is Crown's intention to pay our estimation of the amount owing, together with penalty interest,\\\" chief executive officer Steve McCann wrote to both the gaming regulator and the Department of Treasury and Finance on July 1.Commissioner Ray Finkelstein is expected to deliver a final report detailing his findings and recommendations by October 15.His inquiry centred on Crown's Melbourne operations follows the Bergin inquiry in NSW, which in February found Crown unfit to run a casino at its Barangaroo complex in Sydney.Separately, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation (VCGLR) on Friday confirmed that an independent investigation will examine serious criminal allegations at Melbourne's Crown Casino.The allegations, made by former inspectors of the casino, will be investigated by prominent QC Ian Freckelton.\",\n",

Go back 12 months and talk about the culture of the Maroons and it's pretty much the same staff, playing group.\\\"Greeny's come in for Wayne (Bennett) but otherwise it's pretty much identical, the group that's here.\\\"Welch said he wouldn't \\\"bag the bloke\\\" and that he'd still be happy to play alongside Arrow in a Queensland jersey.\\\"It took me a fair bit as well (to recover from); you do it pretty tough those first few days but you can't do much other than put your hand up and own it,\\\" he said.\\\"Then you put your head down and win back that trust.\\\"\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Fodder quality is key for livestock producers.And if they can store hay and silage without risking any downgrades to the nutritional characteristics of the feed, even better.\\nThat's according to contractor Lee Hitchings.\\n'Farmers are feed testing more and putting in the types of crops that would suit higher energy and higher protein feeds,' he said.\\n'They are more conscious now of what they are baling compared to 10 to 20 years ago, they are more mindful of producing high quality feed.'\\nLee and wife Emma operate Hitchings Contracting at Irrewarra, just north of Colac.\\nFor more than 20 years they have been preserving fodder, cultivating soil and direct-drilling paddocks from the prime dairy country on the outskirts of Simpson, across to the grazing land of Barwon Downs and further north to where livestock production meets the vast fields of cereal crops at Cressy.\\nThey produce a total of 20,000 to 30,000 round bales each year \\u2014 including some of their own lucerne, clover and cereal hay and silage, which gets sold across the state.\\nThe Colac region has been famous for its productive grass-fed dairy industry, but in recent years the make-up of these farms has changed.\\n'Dairy production did go up and then it levelled out, some of the bigger dairies bought the dairies alongside them and some of the smaller farms have now gone over to beef,' Mr Hitchings said.\\n'We still supply them, just different types of feed.\\n'For those with beef, it might be a more fibrous feed like cereal hay at times of year instead of the clover and lucerne hay for the dairy.\\n'Some still feed some of that to beef, but not all the time, whereas with the dairy side of our business it's always about higher energy and protein feed.\\n'We bale straw and on-sell it to either dairy, sheep or beef farmers, they all use a bit of it now.\\n'Years ago, it used to be just dairy farmers using it in a mixer. Now we sell barley straw to people feedlotting beef or lambs and they are mixing it with silage.'\\nDairy makes up about 60 per cent of Hitchings Contracting business, with the remainder split between beef and sheep farmers.\\nWhether the farmer is requiring baling or the purchase of fodder, Mr Hitchings said quality was always front-of-mind.\\nTwo CLAAS mower conditioners help to maintain the quality of all pastures and crops during cutting, while Mr Hitchings and his team ted all silage and also hay when the weather isn't co-operative.\\nCrop packaging plays a huge role in ensuring the calibre of the feed is maintained.\\n'Farmers are always asking \\u2018what is the strongest net and plastic' and they are always wondering if we are putting on the best available net or plastic,' Mr Hitchings said.\\nSince 2001, he has consistently used Tama Australia's Triowrap, the multi-layered and UV-stabilised film used extensively throughout Australia and New Zealand.\\nFor him, Triowrap is proven in the paddock, with the film remaining attached to the bale in all conditions, protecting the silage from pesky bird holes, regardless of the ensiled crop.\\n'We use it for its strength,' Mr Hitchings said.\\n'If you have got something that lets the spikes of the grass, lucerne, oats \\u2014 and even rye-grass if it's dry and stalky enough \\u2014 punch through the film, it lets oxygen in and ruins the silage.'\\nMr Hitchings applies a minimum of six layers to each silage bale, but adjusts it for bales that require additional strength for trucking or those that will be stored for longer periods of time.\\nHe had some farmer clients this year who specifically requested additional net and wrap, and were happy to pay for it, as they were storing excess feed in preparation for drier years.\\n'By spending an extra $1 a bale you are going to have a bale worth $50 that you can feed.\\n'Once it gets damaged, that bale, you may as well say it is $20, it's gone half-rotten and lost its energy and protein. It's not even covering the cost it and milk production will be down, beef and lamb weight will be down.'\\nLongevity and strength in crop packaging is something Tama Australia works hard to achieve, and the company uses paddock trials to ensure its products can withstand different conditions.\\nTama Australia Western Victorian territory manager Phil Millgate provides back-up service and advice for Hitchings Contracting.\\nHe has worked with Mr Hitchings for years and said it was valued customers like Mr Hitchings that provide the real-word feedback needed to develop products for Australian farmers.\\nMr Hitchings has also trialed new products on small portions of his own crop.\\n'A customer trialing a product is great for us,' Mr Millgate said.\\n'For example, and with Lee's permission, I can say to other contractors about his experience and then explain the difference. In some cases, I can even say to them \\u2018go and ring him, ask him'.\\n'The lab tests are good, but as we find out a lot of things in the field, it is where we have to test it.\\n'It's good to have someone like Lee who has been working with us for a fair while.'\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Sydney's escalating COVID-19 woes have cast further doubt on when the city's two AFL sides will return home, with Swans coach John Longmire urging his players to ignore what-ifs ahead of a crunch clash with Western Bulldogs.NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has tightened restrictions while flagging that lockdown could extend beyond next Friday after Sydney's biggest spike in new cases since the start of the current outbreak.The Swans and GWS were slated to square off at Giants Stadium next weekend.The derby remains the only round-18 match that is yet to be assigned a venue, with the league trying to map out both clubs' movements in coming weeks.AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan told players in June that hubs were a last resort, noting he envisaged \\\"two, three weeks (away from home), max\\\".That time frame will soon be exceeded for the Swans and Giants.The league has made it clear it wants to reunite players and staff with families but, as the NRL mulls whether to relocate Sydney-based clubs out of the NSW capital, it is hard to envisage how that will happen in the short term.\\\"Take it day by day. That's all we can do, things change so quickly,\\\" Longmire told reporters.\\\"We're focusing on our footy and trying to make sure that families and loved ones back in Sydney are supported as much as they can be.\\\"You have to be really mindful in these situations that you don't spend all your time thinking about the what-ifs. You can spend a lot of energy on that.\\\"We trust the club and AFL are doing all they can to come up with solutions to get us home first and foremost, but also support our families and loved ones back home.\\\"Some players and staff were unable to bid goodbye to families in person, such was the haste at which they had to rush to a Melbourne-bound charter flight.The Giants are slated to face Essendon, Port Adelaide, Geelong, Richmond and Carlton beyond the derby, while the Swans finish their regular season with matches against Fremantle, Essendon, St Kilda, North Melbourne and Gold Coast.The Dockers-Swans clash looms as a particularly big stumbling block for the AFL and its desire to reunite players with families, given Western Australia's border policy.Longmire admitted that fixturing uncertainty made it harder to map out management plans for players, adding \\\"we just have to roll with it\\\".The Swans trained at Essendon's base on Friday, extending their nomadic stretch in Melbourne.\\\"We're fortunate the Victorian clubs have been great in allowing us access to facilities,\\\" Longmire said.\",\n",

Go back 12 months and talk about the culture of the Maroons and it's pretty much the same staff, playing group.\\\"Greeny's come in for Wayne (Bennett) but otherwise it's pretty much identical, the group that's here.\\\"Welch said he wouldn't \\\"bag the bloke\\\" and that he'd still be happy to play alongside Arrow in a Queensland jersey.\\\"It took me a fair bit as well (to recover from); you do it pretty tough those first few days but you can't do much other than put your hand up and own it,\\\" he said.\\\"Then you put your head down and win back that trust.\\\"\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Sydney's escalating COVID-19 woes have cast further doubt on when the city's two AFL sides will return home, with Swans coach John Longmire urging his players to ignore what-ifs ahead of a crunch clash with Western Bulldogs.NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has tightened restrictions while flagging that lockdown could extend beyond next Friday after Sydney's biggest spike in new cases since the start of the current outbreak.The Swans and GWS were slated to square off at Giants Stadium next weekend.The derby remains the only round-18 match that is yet to be assigned a venue, with the league trying to map out both clubs' movements in coming weeks.AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan told players in June that hubs were a last resort, noting he envisaged \\\"two, three weeks (away from home), max\\\".That time frame will soon be exceeded for the Swans and Giants.The league has made it clear it wants to reunite players and staff with families but, as the NRL mulls whether to relocate Sydney-based clubs out of the NSW capital, it is hard to envisage how that will happen in the short term.\\\"Take it day by day. That's all we can do, things change so quickly,\\\" Longmire told reporters.\\\"We're focusing on our footy and trying to make sure that families and loved ones back in Sydney are supported as much as they can be.\\\"You have to be really mindful in these situations that you don't spend all your time thinking about the what-ifs. You can spend a lot of energy on that.\\\"We trust the club and AFL are doing all they can to come up with solutions to get us home first and foremost, but also support our families and loved ones back home.\\\"Some players and staff were unable to bid goodbye to families in person, such was the haste at which they had to rush to a Melbourne-bound charter flight.The Giants are slated to face Essendon, Port Adelaide, Geelong, Richmond and Carlton beyond the derby, while the Swans finish their regular season with matches against Fremantle, Essendon, St Kilda, North Melbourne and Gold Coast.The Dockers-Swans clash looms as a particularly big stumbling block for the AFL and its desire to reunite players with families, given Western Australia's border policy.Longmire admitted that fixturing uncertainty made it harder to map out management plans for players, adding \\\"we just have to roll with it\\\".The Swans trained at Essendon's base on Friday, extending their nomadic stretch in Melbourne.\\\"We're fortunate the Victorian clubs have been great in allowing us access to facilities,\\\" Longmire said.\",\n",

(Photo: Twitter/@narendramodi) New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday chaired a high-level meeting to review the augmentation and availability of oxygen across the country and instructed officials to ensure that the oxygen plants are made functional at the earliest. Officials briefed Prime Minister about the progress on the installation of PSA oxygen plants across the country. More than 1500 PSA oxygen plants are coming up across the nation which includes contributions from PM CARES as well as various ministries and PSUs, a statement by the PMO said. PSA oxygen plants contributed by PM CARES are coming up in all states and districts of the country. Prime Minister was informed that once all PSA oxygen plants coming up through PM CARES would be functional, they would support more than 4 lakh oxygenated beds, the statement added. PM Modi instructed the officials to ensure that these plants are made functional at the earliest and to work closely with the state governments for the same. Officers apprised PM Modi that they are in regular touch with officers from state governments regarding fast-tracking the oxygen plants, it added. PM Modi asked officials to ensure there is adequate training of hospital staff on the operation and maintenance of oxygen plants. He also directed officials to ensure that each district has trained personnel available. Officials informed him that there is a training module prepared by experts and they are targeting training of around 8000 people across the country, the statement said. PM Modi also said that we should deploy advanced technology like IoT to track performance and functioning of these oxygen plants at a local and national level. Officials apprised the PM about a pilot being done using Internet of Things (IoT) for monitoring the performance of the oxygen plants. Principal Secretary to PM, Cabinet Secretary, Secretary Health, Secretary MoHUA and other important officials were present in the meeting. end-of\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Baloch leaders have expressed their reservations about the government's plan to engage with insurgents in the province, saying that the decision to do so lies with the military leadership only. Speaking on DawnNewsTV show 'Live with Adil Shahzeb' on Thursday night, Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal said he was confused by the premier's recent statement where he said he was considering \\\"talking to insurgents\\\" in the province. \\\"If I am not wrong, he said he has only thought about it, not decided. And a person's thoughts can change at any time,\\\" Mengal said, adding that the country's rulers change their decisions often. \\\"I don't think the government is serious. These are not muzakrat (dialogue), they are mazakrat (a joke),\\\" he said, adding that the people of the province have been a victim of this \\\"joke\\\" since 1947. He stated that the government did not have the power or the authority to hold talks with insurgents. \\\"There are two areas in the region where the establishment has kept powers to itself. One is occupied Kashmir, and the second is Balochistan. 'No political government has ever been given the powers to resolve the issues of Balochistan,' Mengal said, adding that ground realities needed to be accepted. 'Has the establishment ever expressed remorse over what happened to the people of Balochistan?' he asked. Pointing towards the issue of missing persons, he called on the government to address the problems being faced by the people. \\\"You won't need a ticket to London or Switzerland to achieve this.\\\" Mengal said that work on the six-point agenda his party presented to the prime minister did not require permission from the establishment. \\\"However, when we used to meet him, he used to say 'go and talk to the army chief or the director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence'. From his language and from his actions, it is clear that the military establishment does not want to resolve the issue of Balochistan. \\\"They have a golden bird in their hands [...] they will never let it go,\\\" he said. National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik said that the province had been burning for the past 15 years, holding former military ruler retired Gen Pervez Musharraf responsible for the current wave of militancy in the province. Malik said his party had always advocated for talks with Baloch militants. \\\"Let me tell you frankly: the political leadership does not have the solution for this. It lies with the military leadership,\\\" he said. 'No difference between army and govt' However, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry rebutted the claims of the two politicians. \\\"There is a tradition among certain segments to say that the government and the army are separate. [But] there is no such problem in the current government.\\\" He said that the premier makes the decisions after listening to different points of view. The information minister also hit back at Mengal, saying, \\\"When he [Mengal] needs money for the budget or for favours, he has to speak to the government, not the establishment.\\\" Fawad, however, conceded that that there existed a point of view that Baloch insurgents should not be engaged at all. \\\"We will look at this on a case-to-case basis. We will see who we can talk to and who we can't.\\\" Fawad said that the premier had first announced that he was thinking of speaking to insurgents in the province. Then he appointed Shahzain Bugti as his special assistant on reconciliation and harmony in Balochistan. \\\"In the third phase, we will determine which groups we can talk to and which ones we can't. Then we will have to see what can be talked about, as well as what concessions can or can't be offered by the state.' He said that India linked groups had already been excluded from this process, adding that there was a difference between being linked to India and being used by India. \\\"It will be hard to engage with those who have taken money from India for terrorism in Pakistan. Those who were used [by someone], that is another matter,\\\" he said.\",\n",

(Photo: Twitter/@narendramodi) New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday chaired a high-level meeting to review the augmentation and availability of oxygen across the country and instructed officials to ensure that the oxygen plants are made functional at the earliest. Officials briefed Prime Minister about the progress on the installation of PSA oxygen plants across the country. More than 1500 PSA oxygen plants are coming up across the nation which includes contributions from PM CARES as well as various ministries and PSUs, a statement by the PMO said. PSA oxygen plants contributed by PM CARES are coming up in all states and districts of the country. Prime Minister was informed that once all PSA oxygen plants coming up through PM CARES would be functional, they would support more than 4 lakh oxygenated beds, the statement added. PM Modi instructed the officials to ensure that these plants are made functional at the earliest and to work closely with the state governments for the same. Officers apprised PM Modi that they are in regular touch with officers from state governments regarding fast-tracking the oxygen plants, it added. PM Modi asked officials to ensure there is adequate training of hospital staff on the operation and maintenance of oxygen plants. He also directed officials to ensure that each district has trained personnel available. Officials informed him that there is a training module prepared by experts and they are targeting training of around 8000 people across the country, the statement said. PM Modi also said that we should deploy advanced technology like IoT to track performance and functioning of these oxygen plants at a local and national level. Officials apprised the PM about a pilot being done using Internet of Things (IoT) for monitoring the performance of the oxygen plants. Principal Secretary to PM, Cabinet Secretary, Secretary Health, Secretary MoHUA and other important officials were present in the meeting. ...\",\n",

Ramesh Pokhriyal (File Photo) New Delhi: Realizing the importance of continuous dialogue with all the stakeholders in crafting a new policy Dr Nishank successfully engaged with states' Education Ministers, Governors, Education Secretaries, and Vice Chancellors of Universities across the country. Efforts were made to reach out to 2.5 lakh gram panchayats to include everyone's opinion.\\u00a0In order to get feedback from\\u00a0 the entire country Dr Nishank got it translated\\u00a0 into twenty two Indian languages. In addition, he held a series of comprehensive meetings with the public representatives representing various regions of the country.\\u00a0Apart from meeting the MPs, Chief Ministers of the various states, he encouraged educationists to organise workshops and seminars in their institutions .\\u00a0NGOs and social organisations and government institutions were encouraged to hold a series of meetings and workshops on NEP 2020.\\u00a0This massive exercise\\u00a0 resulted in collection of more than 2 lakh suggestions across India and abroad .\\u00a0Considered to be one of the largest open innovative exercise, the\\u00a0 wide\\u00a0 consultation resulted in inclusion of stakeholders aspirations .\\u00a0The result is that the new education policy has been widely welcomed in the country and abroad.\\u00a0Infact, it is\\u00a0 for the\\u00a0 first time in the history of Independent India, that an India centric education policy has been formulated, reflecting the strong resolve to make India a knowledge-based superpower.\\u00a0The best universities in the world such as Harvard, Cambridge and Michigan have lauded this innovative policy. Being scientific research-oriented, practical and innovative education policy, foreign scholars have also heaped praises on the new education policy.\\u00a0More than 100 top institutions of the\\u00a0 world have analyzed and appreciated various aspects of the National education policy.\\u00a0This new education policy will in fact provide a strong foundation to build\\u00a0 New India. It's only through successful implementation of this policy that we can fulfill the dream of making India a 'Vishwa Guru' in future.\\u00a0Considering the important and central role of students in implementation , the education policy focuses on providing them excellent training opportunities with a focus to transform them completely.\\u00a0Number of positive measures are being undertaken to make our students strategically competitive at the global level.\\u00a0The fact that Dr Nishank maintained continuous dialogue with all the stakeholders was also widely appreciated.\\u00a0The move was\\u00a0 widely welcomed by the students and teachers alike during the difficult and challenging times of corona .\\u00a0Addressing the children from the AIIMS does\\u00a0 reflect his deep concern\\u00a0 and affection for the students.\\u00a0The education fraternity of the country will remember him as a minister very much sensitive to the problems and challenges being confronted by students.\",\n",

London: The 25-year-old, who said he was drawn to the Olympics as a boy by Michael Phelps' dominating performances, will be competing against the likes of Rory McIlroy and Hideki Matsuyama at the Kasumigaseki Country Club on the outskirts of Tokyo.\\\"Growing up, not many people knew I swam a lot,\\\" Jazz said in comments published by the PGA tour. \\\"My dad wanted me to become a swimmer.\\\"When I was between 4- to 8-years-old, I used to swim a few kilometres every day. It was crazy. Now I won't even go into the water.\\\"I would follow athletics and swimming and there was no golf back then. I used to watch Phelps dominate the pool, so it was a thing. The Olympics is the biggest stage for sports and it's a huge priority for me.\\\"At the age of 14, Jazz became the youngest golfer to make the cut on the Asian Tour at an event in 2010, then became a professional a day before turning 15.He took a brief sabbatical from the sport in 2016 to become a monk and the following year picked up his first Asian Tour win in Bangladesh.Now a six-time winner on the Asian Tour, Jazz came agonisingly close to his first European Tour title earlier this year when he lost to Daniel van Tonder in a playoff at the Savannah Classic.\\\"I don't like to daydream and I don't say things like I want to win the Masters one day or The Open,\\\" he added. \\\"I won't day-dream except for the Olympics. The Olympics is different and I would often think what if I can win an Olympic medal.\\\"Golf is not like any other sport and you don't need to be the best. You just need to have the right week.\\\"It would be mad to get a medal, it'll be crazy if I do.\\\"\",\n",

Kochi: The high court said it was concerned that every ''Tom, Dick, and Harry'' was collecting funds via crowdfunding for treatment of the children suffering from rare diseases and asked the state government whether it has any control over such transactions.\\u00a0Justice P B Suresh Kumar said the court does not want to interdict the crowdfunding process, but it wants the funds to go to the government instead into the account of some private individuals who may or may not give it to those who require the money.\\u00a0''I do not want every Tom, Dick, and Harry to collect money. Is there any state control over this collection of funds via crowdfunding? We should know where the money is going,'' the court said and added that if private individuals and entities can collect crores of rupees in a short span of time, why the government cannot? ''For providing free vaccines the state government could collect only Rs 68 lakh, while 18 crores were collected in a week (for treatment of a boy suffering from spinal muscular atrophy),'' the court said.\\u00a0''I do not want to interdict the process of crowdfunding, but I want government control over it,'' Justice Kumar said during the hearing of an autorickshaw driver's plea seeking free treatment for his six-month-old infant son who is suffering from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) as the medicine for it costs around Rs 18 crore and he has no means to raise that kind of money.\\u00a0In his petition, filed through advocate P Chandrasekhar, the father - Arif - has said that while he obtained permission for importing the required medicine - Zolgensma Onasemnogene injection - he cannot afford to buy even one dose as the same costs Rs 18 crore.\\u00a0During the hearing, the Kerala government also expressed apprehensions regarding the source of the money being collected via crowdfunding.\\u00a0The court also observed during the hearing that such transactions if left unsupervised could destabilize the economy.\\u00a0It has on its own also impleaded the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the matter.\\u00a0The court said it would be passing a detailed order in the matter.\\u00a0Arif has moved the court, claiming that he cannot ensure his son's treatment without the support of the state government.\\u00a0The government, in a statement filed in court earlier, had said that neither the Health Department nor the Kerala Social Security Mission (KSSM) was in a position to extend financial support for bearing the huge cost of the treatment/medicine required by Arif's son, who has been admitted in the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital and is on ventilator support.\\u00a0The government had also said that according to the National Rare Disease Policy,2021 of the Union Health Ministry Ministry, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is categorized in Group 3, for which the cost of treatment is very high, and it recommends a digital crowdfunding platform be leveraged for mobilizing the necessary funds.\\u00a0It had further said that there are around 102 patients in the state suffering from SMA, a rare genetic disorder, of whom 42 have received the treatment under the compassionate use program extended by pharmaceutical companies.\\u00a0The state also said that the funds it has, Including those under the We Care scheme, are not even sufficient to meet the needs of various health schemes of the KSSM, which assists the elderly, cancer patients below 18 years of age, and minors requiring emergency treatment for various other ailments like heart disease.\\u00a0''In these circumstances, it is humbly submitted that the Health department and KSSM is not in a position to extend financial support for bearing the huge expenditure of SMA,'' the state had said in its statement and sought dismissal of the petition Kerala High Court | Crowdfunding | Rare Diseases\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Hurt by the criticism that has followed him ever since an injury-ravaged India upstaged Australia early this year, coach Justin Langer said most of it confused him. Washington: In January this year, Australia lost the home Test series 1-2 against an under-strength India, who made a heroic comeback under Ajinkya Rahane's leadership after losing the opening match in Adelaide.The visiting side battled the absence of star batsman and regular skipper Virat Kohli along with a spate of injuries to triumph in the series. Langer and Australia Test skipper Tim Paine drew heavy criticism for floundering tactically against a hampered rival.''Some of the things I was reading were a bit confusing actually. If I'm completely honest I was really hurt by some of it. The feedback I've been given for three years has been overwhelmingly positive of the role that I've been able to play as a coach,'' Langer said ahead of the T20 series opener against West Indies here on Saturday.Australia are currently touring West Indies for a five-match T20 series and three ODIs. Langer admitted that he didn't like losing to India but was committed to his job.''If the board and the CEO and high performance manager believe I'm the right person to keep leading us forward, absolutely. I absolutely love my job,'' he said.''I didn't like losing to India in the amazing series, no one likes losing. I'm absolutely committed, I love my job, I love the Australian cricket team, I love the players and I love Australian cricket.''They're the things I value most in my life. Hopefully I've done a really good job the last three years, that's been the feedback. Long may that continue.'' Langer was appointed as Australia's head coach in 2018 on a four-year contract, replacing Darren Lehmann.The former left-handed opener refused to rate himself as a ''great coach'', insisting that the team's focus remains on doing well in this year's ICC World T20 in the UAE and the home Ashes series against England starting December.''We're not a great team yet and that's what we're all aspiring to. Like I'm aspiring to be a great coach,'' he said.''I'm not a great coach yet, I'm aspiring to be a great coach. I'm working towards it and I hope all the players are doing the same thing,'' added the 50-year-old.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Published: Jul 09,202102:17 PM by PTI To stimulate the economy and ease the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman last month announced eight economic measures amounting to Rs 6.29 lakh crore to provide relief to individuals as well as businesses in the country. New Delhi: The Finance Ministry on Friday said the economy has started showing signs of revival from the impact of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the back of targeted fiscal relief, monetary policy and a rapid vaccination drive.'The broad-based economic relief package, extended to mitigate the second wave, amounted to Rs 6.29 lakh crore. RBI continues with its efforts to calm the nerves of the market and revive sectors with both backward and forward linkages and multiplier effects on growth,' the ministry said in its monthly economic review.To stimulate the economy and ease the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman last month announced eight economic measures amounting to Rs 6.29 lakh crore to provide relief to individuals as well as businesses in the country.Apart from eight relief measures announced in health and other worst affected sectors, Sitharaman announced a stimulus package for the tourism industry, which included five lakh tourist visas to be issued free of charge, once the government resumes issuance. The total financial implication of the scheme will be Rs 100 crore.Resilient tax collections of the central government in the first two months of FY 2020-21 and sustained momentum in capital expenditure, particularly in the road and rail sector, the report said, augurs well for continued economic recovery driven by capital expenditures.The report further added that the recently announced economic relief package was 'expected to further oil the wheels of the Capex cycle via implementation of the PLI scheme and streamlining of processes for PPP Projects and Asset Monetisation'.Consumption sentiment is expected to pick up with further enhancement of employment support under Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ANBRY), targeted support to the urban poor through the credit guarantee scheme for on-lending by micro-finance institutions and wider Bharat-Net digitisation coverage, the economic review for June said.Free food-grain and enhanced fertiliser subsidies under the package along with continued MGNREGA implementation, on the other hand, would serve as a cushion for rural demand in the coming quarters, it said.\\\"Maintaining a rapid pace on vaccination and quickly bridging health care infrastructure gaps across both urban and rural areas would emerge as the most sustainable stimulus for durable recovery of the Indian economy,\\\" the report added.Going forward, it said, further expansion of vaccination and strict adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour will be a critical safeguard against the emergence of a possible third wave.On high food prices, the report said, healthy monsoon coverage, gradually rising Kharif sowing and unlocking of states is expected to ease food, and thereby headline inflation.However, it said, risks due to global demand-led recovery in commodity prices and input cost pressures remain.About global economic growth, it said this has continued its upward trajectory in June 2021.Falling COVID-19 infections and accelerating vaccinations consolidated US recovery and renewed growth prospects in the Euro Area, it said, adding global trade remained buoyant with an uptick in global commercial flight and port activity, which portends well for Indian exports.However, it said, the resurgence of delta variant infections, firming inflationary pressures, unequal access to vaccination and burgeoning debt levels continue to lend substantial uncertainty to the global economic outlook. economy relief | Finance Minister | Nirmala Sitharaman\",\n",

Washington: According to Fox News, Kalman works as an art director and has collaborated with Travis Scott and Kng Kng Records, among others.Hadid was first romantically linked to the artist in early June when they were spotted out on a lunch date together. As per reports, they were apparently introduced through friends and their relationship started up following her split from on-again-off-again boyfriend The Weeknd, who sparked his own romance rumors this week after dining with Angelina Jolie.However long the pair have been dating, the model does not seem to be keeping Kalman under wraps anymore.

Kalman has also done projects in the fashion industry sphere, designing logo art for Made Fashion Week and fashion brand A Bathing Ape.

(Image credit: Social media) Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday urged the Centre to waive GST and customs duty on a life-saving drug to be imported from the US for the treatment of a child suffering from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a rare disease, in the state. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he detailed the plight of 18-month-old Muhammed, a native of Kannur district, who is undergoing treatment for the disease. Noting that the medicine for SMA is 'prohibitively expensive' and 'unaffordable' for the child's family, Vijayan said it costs a whopping Rs 18 crore and is proposed to be imported from the US. The CM, in the letter, also pointed out that the central government had recently waived tax in a similar case of a five month old child, who is suffering from SMA in Mumbai. \\\"I request you to give directions to the Union Finance Ministry to take steps not to levy Customs duty and integrated Goods and Services Tax (GST) in this case involving the import of the life saving drug zolgensma,\\\" he said. The Chief Minister's plea to the Centre came days after funds for purchasing the drug had been raised in Kerala through online crowdfunding for Muhammed. Son of P K Rafeeq and Mariyumma, the child requires a dose of Zolgensma, which is considered as one of the most expensive drug in the world. The treatment committee had on Monday informed the public that over Rs 18 crore reached the bank accounts opened for the donations and asked the people not to deposit any more. The campaign was taken over by social media resulting in raising the amount within seven days from across the world. Incidentally, 15-year-old Afra, the elder sister of Mohammed, was also affected with the same disease. The medicine would have to be procured from abroad and the treatment committee had petitioned the state government to initiate the process for procurement. Medical experts suggest that the child will have to be administered the dose of the medicine before he reaches the age of two, family sources said. ...\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Published: Jul 09,202102:03 PM by Reuters Tokyo 2020 Olympics organisers have bowed to political pressure and rising COVID-19 infections and banned almost all fans from the Games just two weeks before they start, after insisting that they could go ahead with spectators. Tokyo: The decision, made after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced on Thursday a fourth state of emergency for the capital, all but robs the Games of their last hope for pomp and public spectacle.Japanese Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said he felt sorry for athletes but that the decision was the right one. \\\"Please stay at home for this Olympics, and share that excitement with families at home,\\\" he told a news conference.The Games, postponed from last year, are scheduled to run from July 23 to Aug. 8, and opinion polls have consistently shown the Japanese public is worried about going ahead with them during a pandemic. In a recent media survey, 35% favoured no spectators, 26% wanted some limits and 34% wanted the Games cancelled or postponed. Spectators from overseas were banned months ago.The move also looks likely to snuff out a best-case scenario for Suga, in which he would call a snap general election soon after a successful Games that had rejuvenated his soggy support. \\\"That scenario has broken down completely,\\\" independent political analyst Atsuo Ito said. An election for parliament's powerful lower house must be held later this year and Suga also faces a reelection race for the ruling party leadership.Once seen as a chance for Japan to showcase its recovery from prolonged stagnation and a devastating earthquake a decade ago, the event has been hit by massive budget overruns. Medical experts have said for weeks that having no spectators would be the least risky option, amid widespread public fears that an influx of tens of thousands of athletes and officials would fuel a fresh wave of infections.REDUCED RISK, LITTLE BUZZ Tara Kirk Sell, an Olympic silver medalist in swimming and professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, welcomed the decision.\\\"It's obviously disappointing for everyone involved. But I think it reduces the risk quite a bit,\\\" she told Reuters. Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said on Friday that organisers aimed to decide on spectators at the Aug. 24-Sept. 5 Paralympics as soon as possible after the Olympics close.Asked about plans by top International Olympic Committee officials to go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, devastated by atomic bombs in the final days of World War Two, Hashimoto said the visits were a chance to send a message of world peace. IOC President Thomas Bach is to visit Hiroshima on July 16 and IOC Vice-President John Coates Nagasaki the same day.Remarks by IOC officials seeming to dismiss concerns about the pandemic have angered many in Japan and Hashtag #BachGoHome trended on Twitter on Thursday, the day he arrived in Japan. Japan has not suffered the huge outbreaks seen elsewhere but has recorded more than 800,000 cases and over 14,890 deaths. Tokyo reported 822 new infections on Friday, the 20th straight day of week-on-week rises.Just over 25% of the population has received one vaccine shot and supply glitches are causing an initially delayed vaccination rollout to stumble. Tokyo - which had been counting on a record boom in tourism - has experienced little buzz and excitement.The Tokyo leg of the Olympic torch relay kicked off on Friday with a small ceremony in a nearly empty park. The relay will be kept off public streets and only small ceremonies, with no public spectators, will be held over the next two weeks People will also be asked not to gather for events on public roads, such as the triathlon, though some venues outside the greater Tokyo metropolitan area will allow small numbers of spectators.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar said on Friday that there are clear signs of a fourth Covid-19 wave starting in Pakistan. In a message on Twitter, the minister said: \\\"Two weeks ago, I had tweeted that our artificial intelligence models are showing the possible emergence of a fourth wave. Now there are clear early signs of a fourth wave starting.\\\" Umar blamed poor compliance with coronavirus-related standard operating procedures (SOPs) and spread of virus variants, particularly Delta variant that was first detected in India, for the looming fourth wave of Covid-19. In another tweet, the minister said field reports were showing a complete disregard of the condition of vaccination for those attending indoor weddings, and going to indoor restaurants and gyms. \\\"If the owners of these facilities do not show responsibility and ensure compliance, there will be no choice but to shut them down,\\\" he said. Umar's warning has come just a day after Prime Minister Imran expressed worry in a video message over a looming fourth wave of Covid-19 and termed the Delta variant the \\\"biggest concern\\\". In his message to the nation, the premier had referred to Afghanistan, Indonesia and other countries hit by the Delta variant and expressed concern over the upward trajectory of Covid-19 cases in Pakistan, just days after they were on the decline. 'We fear the Indian variant could strike Pakistan and as a precautionary measure, we need to adhere to the SOPs,' he had said. Earlier, the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), the nerve centre of Pakistan's coronavirus response, had confirmed the presence of different variants of coronavirus in Pakistan, including the Delta variant, Beta variant that was first detected in South Africa, and the Alpha variant that was discovered in the United Kingdom. The NCOC had said that these variants were detected in Pakistan in May and June. The confirmation came amid an uptick in Covid-19 cases in the country. According to the government's Covid-19 portal, the number of daily Covid-19 cases dropped from four digits to three digits on June 25. The daily cases being reported remained close to the 900 mark till June 27 and further fell to 735 on June 28. Then the number of cases gradually started increasing and doubled in just one week. The positivity rate, which stood at less than 2 per cent in June, crossed 3pc after a gap of 20 days on Wednesday. On Friday, Pakistan reported over 1,000 Covid-19 cases for the third straight day. The country recorded 1,737 coronavirus cases and 27 deaths during the last 24 hours. Despite a rise in cases, Umar has said the government will not impose a complete lockdown during the fourth wave of the pandemic. Addressing an oath-taking ceremony of newly appointed members of the National Youth Council on Thursday, the minister had, however, added that a proposal for smart lockdowns was on the cards.\",\n",

The instructions come days after Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti took oath as the 51st LHC chief justice.

The use of mobile phones during court hours, apart from during intervals, was also prohibited. The court warned of disciplinary action against judicial officers using their influence for postings/transfers. It also warned of action against \\\"oft and unnecessary\\\" visits to the high court without going through the proper channels. In hardship cases, prior permission through the registrar shall be sought, it said. \\\"Keeping and displaying a blue light on an official or private vehicle of any judicial officer, or putting green plates on private vehicles shall also amount to misconduct and shall be strictly dealt with.\\\" It added that judicial officers were bound to strictly observe punctuality and wear an official uniform. The court warned that if a judicial officer is found violating the instructions issued, strict disciplinary action will be taken and the misconduct would also be added to their personal file, which will be considered during the time of their promotion.\",\n",

We last saw her on our television screens in 2016's Bin Roye. During her break from TV, she made her Bollywood debut alongside Shah Rukh Khan in the film Raees. Mahira will star alongside actor Kubra Khan and Usman Mukhtar. The serial is based on Umera Ahmed's novel of the same name and the script has been written by Ahmed herself. The drama is directed by Farooq Rind and produced by Nina Kashif and MD Productions. The drama tells the story of three characters \\u2014 played by Mahira, Kubra and Mukhtar \\u2014 and reflects on childhood traumas and how the wrong kind of guidance from elders changes their lives. Singer-songwriter Haroon Shahid plays a pivotal role in the story development as well, Kashif told Images. This isn't the first time Mahira has starred in a drama written by Ahmed. The actor was previously seen in the highly acclaimed Shehr e Zaat. Mahira recently took to Instagram to share a promotional poster featuring her character from the upcoming show. Her character Mehreen is bespectacled and looks quite serious, a persona that is quite the departure from how we've usually seen Mahira on screen in the past. While the release date for the drama has yet to be announced, Mahira's fans are already brimming with excitement on social media. Are you excited for Mahira's TV comeback?\",\n",

Chennai: The accused P Yogaraja and his wife Sasikala had assets worth a meagre Rs 83,000 at the beginning of the check period. But at the end of the check period five years later, it grew to Rs 2.1 crore, said sleuths from the agency.\\u00a0According to the FIR that the agency filed, Yogaraja enriched himself illicitly, in his name and in the name of his wife, when he was in government service. Most of the acquisitive activities of the accused officer and his wife took place between August 2014 and September 2019, said the agency, adding that it was hence chosen as the tentative check period to assess his illicit assets.\\u00a0Within those five years, he increased the value of his assets he possessed from Rs 83,000 to Rs 2.1 crore through his illegal activities. Of the total assets that the couple had, assets worth Rs 1.84 crore were disproportionate to his known source of income, the DVAC has found.\\u00a0Now, the accused official and his wife are facing a probe by DVAC, which has registered a case under Prevention of Corruption Act.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Published: Jul 09,202101:16 PM by PTI Militia attacks have only been increasing against the US in military bases in both Iraq and Syria. Baghdad: Iran's expeditionary Quds Force commander brought one main directive for Iraqi militia faction leaders long beholden to Tehran when he gathered with them in Baghdad last month: Maintain calm, until after nuclear talks between Iran and the United States.But he was met with defiance. One of the six faction leaders spoke up in their meeting: They could not stay quiet while the death of his predecessor Qassim Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a US drone strike went unavenged.Militia attacks have only been increasing against the US in military bases in both Iraq and Syria.Three missile attacks in the last week alone resulted in minor injuries, stoking fears of escalation.The details from Esmail Ghaani's visit, confirmed to The Associated Press by three Shiite political officials and two senior militia officials, demonstrate how Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia groups are asserting a degree of independence, sometimes even flouting orders from Tehran.Iran now relies on Lebanon's Hezbollah for support in reining them in, and there is potential that Iran''s new president could play a role in doing the same.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meetings.Iran's influence, sustained by ideological ties and military support, has frayed because of the US killing of Soleimani and al-Muhandis last year, because of differing interests and because of financial strains in Tehran. With nuclear talks restarting following US President Joe Biden''s inauguration this year, these differences have come to the fore.'Iran isn't the way it used to be, with 100 per cent control over the militia commanders,' said one Shiite political leader.Increasing rocket and drone attacks targeting American troops in Iraq and Syria have alarmed Western and coalition officials.There have been at least eight drone attacks targeting the US presence since Biden took office in January, as well as 17 rocket attacks, according to coalition officials.The attacks are blamed on the Iranian-backed militias that make up the bulk of Iraq's state-supported Popular Mobilisation Forces.The Biden administration has responded by twice targeting Iraqi militia groups operating inside Syria, including close to the Iraqi border.'What is taking place now is when Ghaani asks for calm, the brigade leaders agree with him. But as soon as he leaves the meeting, they disregard his recommendations,' said another Shiite political leader.The loudest of the defiant militia voices has been Qais al-Khazali, leader of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq faction, which also maintains a political party.On June 17, only days after Ghaani''s meetings with the militias, he said in a televised address that they would continue to target the U.S. 'occupier' and that they will not take into consideration nuclear talks.'And that decision is an Iraqi one,' he said.The coalition has formally ended combat operations and reduced troop levels significantly in the last year.Only 2,500 US troops remain in Iraq and discussions are ongoing with NATO to transfer to an advisory mission. Iraq still needs coalition support in surveillance and intelligence gathering and airstrikes against Islamic State group targets.Some argue the ongoing attacks benefit Iran by maintaining pressure on the US.During talks with Shiite political officials during his visit, Ghani said Iran doesn't interfere in their political work, but that military matters were different.'These must be approved by the Revolutionary Guard,' one political leader recounted him saying.Still, Ghaani did not reprimand the militia groups during the meeting. Instead, he told them he understood their concerns.Iran has struggled to fill in the gap left in the absence of Soleimani and al-Muhandis, who were commanding figures able to push factions into line and resolve disputes among them.\\\"Ghaani has a different style and capabilities,' said Michael Knights, a fellow at The Washington Institute. He has a looser framework, establishing broad red lines on some matters, while 'other things are don't ask, don't tell,' he said.Along with asking for less, cash-strapped Iran has been giving less as well.Assistance to the groups has been significantly downgraded since US sanctions began crippling Iran's economy last year.Divisions among factions have deepened, with growing competition among militias and Shiite politicians.Ghaani came to meet the militia leaders to mend tensions that were sparked weeks earlier when Iraqi authorities arrested a paramilitary commander, Qassim Musleh, prompting a standoff between PMF fighters and security forces.Ghaani brought a letter from Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, criticizing the PMF for its reaction, saying it weakened their position.To apply pressure on the factions, Iran has come to rely on Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah in Lebanon, a figure the militias highly respect.Almost weekly, various factional leaders hold face-to-face meetings with him in Lebanon, said Shiite political leaders.Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, elected in June, also may be a unifying figure for the militias, which hold him in high esteem, political and militia officials said.When Raisi visited Baghdad in February, he met with PMF commanders and told them, in fluent Arabic, 'Our flesh is your flesh, and our blood is your blood.' Ghaani communicates with brigade leaders through an interpreter.'The resistance will grow in power and will see its best of times due to the election victory of Raisi,' said Abu Alaa al-Walae, commander of Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, in a recent interview.\",\n",
