      "      \"summary\": \"LoadingMs Berejiklian said she appreciated the message delivered on Friday was shocking, but that she needed 'everybody to be shocked'.'NSW is facing the biggest challenge we have faced since the pandemic started, and I don't say that lightly,' she said.'Unless there's a dramatic turnaround in the numbers, I can't see how we'll be in a position to ease restrictions by next Friday.'Do not leave your home. Do not leave your home unless you absolutely have to. That is what a lockdown is,' she said.Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said 43 people were currently in hospital due to COVID, with 10 people in ICU, four of whom are being ventilated.'Of the 10 people in ICU, one is in their 20s, one is in their 30s one is in their 50s, five are in their 60s and two are in their 70s,' she said.'This trend has to be turned around and the only way we can do so is by seeing a decline in numbers.'Dr Chant said people in suburbs like Kareela, Sylvania, Hurstville and Maroubra needed to stay particularly vigilant and come forward for testing.South-west Sydney remains of heightened concern, including suburbs like Bossley Park, Smithfield, Fairfield, West Hoxton, Bass Hill, Greenacre, St John's Park, Bonnyrigg, Bankstown, Canley Vale, Chester Hill and Edensor Park.Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday announced 300,000 extra vaccine doses would be fast-tracked to NSW to boost inoculations in south-west Sydney, targeting the 'most vulnerable in the community.'The doses will comprise equal components of both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines.Mr Morrison on Friday told Seven's Sunrise that Australia's vaccine troubles to date needed to be put into perspective.'We are in a global pandemic, it's as simple as that. Sadly, the program has had its challenges but ... when it comes to fatalities, deaths from COVID, that is the statistic, obviously, where Australia leads the world,' he said.'Just the other day, they had more cases in the UK in one day than Australia has had in the past 18 months. I think you've got to look at these things in balance'.A number of new western Sydney locations were added to NSW Health's list of COVID-19 exposure sites on Wednesday night, among them retail stores, cafes and supermarkets.Eleven of those are close contact sites, meaning anyone who attended at the relevant times must immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days no matter the result.The venues include Aldi and Kmart in Merrylands, both on Monday, July 5, between 1.30 and 3.30pm and Australia Post in Merrylands on July 5, from 2-3pm.Other venues include Kathmandu Burwood on July 4, from 12.35-1pm, Beds r Us Wetherill Park on July 5, between 2.30 and 3.15pm, as well as food outlets in Auburn and Smithfield.Sydney's hospitals are standing by to mobilise COVID-19 surge plans in preparation for the possible influx of people needing urgent care, with more than 10 per cent of the state's cases now in hospital.As the number of cases in intensive care climbs, the Australian Medical Association has warned the health system would be overwhelmed if the Greater Sydney lockdown was eased before spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant is contained.Stay across the most crucial developments related to the pandemic with the Coronavirus Update.

      "      \"summary\": \"Commentary\\n BC Pires \\n 2 Hrs Ago BC Pires - \\nTHANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY\\n\\n\\nBC PIRES\\n\\nLAST THURSDAY, 18,000-odd 11-year-olds sat the Secondary Entrance Assessment, all hoping to pass for a 'prestige school' which, in Trinidad, means one where the teachers are more worried about their students getting nine CXCs under their belt than they already having TEC Nines in their book bags. \\nLast Friday, I did the maths section of a Newsday practice test. Today I will wrestle with what we now call 'language arts' because we're too ashamed of how poorly we do 'English.' \\n\\nLanguage Arts. Section I. \\n \\nTask 1. Correct the six spelling mistakes:\\nSimba sirveyed the bed below him. The new dog, which the humans affectionatly called 'Chino,' was sleeping contently on it. Simba wanted to play! He swished his tale, wiggled and pounced on the creature. Chino howled and jumped! Simba felt satisfyed. The spelling mistakes are obvious, apart from 'contently' for 'contentedly,' which modern 11-year-olds will think isn't a mistake at all, because they will think it refers to 'content,' ie, any stupid 15-second video they post on TikTok, but you have to look for the cultural/socio-economic errors. Unless Simba and Chino are pets in a stoosh household, eg, what the firetruck are they doing on the bed? Except possibly in Westmoorings, Trinidad dogs are outside in the rain. With one end of an old rope tied around their neck and the other to a mango tree valued more highly than them. \\n\\nTask 2. Correct the six punctuation and capitalisation errors:\\nromano observed the tadpoles and fish darting between rocks in the pond As he stared at them in awe a voice shouted, 'Boo'. romano fell into the pond. His brother, Trevor, exclaimed, Got you!' There is a lot more wrong with poor Romano than not having his name capitalised, such as having a surname for a forename and not having a PS4 or any gaming platform at all \\u2013 otherwise why would he be in awe of tadpoles and fish darting in a firetrucking pond? This is a little boy in Trinidad, not Sir David Attenborough on the BBC. Romano's biggest problem, though, is clearly his brother, Trevor, who got the good first name and who has poor Romano in such an extended state of hyper-anxiety, he needs to watch tadpoles to calm down. Romano's best correction will be to NEVER stand near the edge of any precipice if Trevor is within shouting distance. \\n\\nTask 3. Correct the six grammar errors:\\nBlack vultures known as 'corbeaux' at Trinidad are important to the environment and helps to keep it clean. Despite they reputation around being dirty, black vultures often clean itself by bathing in rivers and streams. Before the grammatically incorrect, we must deal with the politically incorrect, viz, why are the vultures being described as 'black?' It is now racist to use 'black' as a descriptive, following the penalising of the European football club official who identified the only black person on the field by saying, 'the black guy' instead of, say, 'the third-tallest player on the team that is losing at the moment' or 'the player nearest the goalpost who is not the goalie, no, wait, the player who is second-nearest\\u2026 no, wait, third-nearest\\u2026no, wait\\u2026'\\nThere is also a distinct possibility of anti-Indian racism coming into play because the dirty black vultures clean themselves by bathing in rivers. Why not the sea? Why the river? To me, the imputation is clear that there must be some duck currying in a pot somewhere, ergo, the most correctest thing to do is to set all future SEA questions in villages in England, with rosy-cheeked blonde children doing all the heavy-social media-storm-avoiding-lifting in the exam questions. \\nWe could even do the maths section with sums out of my old 1969 arithmetic textbooks, which required Trinidadian children to add up and subtract pounds, shillings and pence. \\nAnd then we could formally reverse independence. \\nAnd maybe come out of it and into West Indian Federation next time. \\nChanges to the SEA have made it impossible to do, in a newspaper column, the 'comprehension,' or to write what used to be 'the essay' but is now, regrettably, 'ELA \\u2013 presumably English Language Arts \\u2013 Writing.' \\nWhich starts with something called 'Prewriting,' further sub-divided into Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action and Resolution, which sounds more like a Friday night in a club and a quarrel and she went home than a primary school essay. That's enough SEA to drown in. \\n\\nBC Pires is a dunce with Newsday and, ergo, about to be appointed to the Cabinet. Read the full version of this column on Saturday at www.BCPires.com\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"CONTRIBUTOR To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. COVID 19 virus took the world by surprise. It started as small China problem and subsequently to become a global pandemic \\u2013 the entire world problem. The net effect has been that national governments have to impose strict measures including lockdowns, social distancing, wearing of face masks, washing of hands and others to minimize the catastrophic effect of it. Notwithstanding the above, lives are been lost daily and infection rates are still at its peak. Businesses has also had their fair share of the catastrophic effect of the pandemic. Businesses have been folded up, some struggling and others working on rotation basis. Scientist advised that the surest way to get pandemic under control is to get all and sundry vaccinated to minimize the spread, avoid severe illness and death. Unfortunately hand full of covid 19 vaccines have been approved, by relevant bodies, to be safe and effective to fight the covid.\\u00a0 Recently Ghana's Government in an effort to minimize and control the various managed to secure about 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Vaccine for the country. The doses imported were not enough to vaccinate the entire population, however, at some point more vaccines will be approved and there will be enough vaccines for all persons who are willing to be vaccinated. Notwithstanding the obvious benefits of the vaccines, there is still high rate of potential vaccination hesitancy. Several people both young and old have decided not to take the vaccination. Some attribute it to religious beliefs; trust in the efficacy of the vaccine and others conspiracy theories. So far there is no law or policy in Ghana that makes the vaccination mandatory. However some employers in their quest to return business back to normal and also to complying with their obligations under the 1992 constitution and the Labour law may make policies and decisions that will compel employees to take the vaccine. We will discuss whether such measure or policies can be lawful? OBLIGATION ON EMPLOYERS TO MAKE WORK PLACE SAFE AND HEALTHY Employers who may want to make Covid 19 vaccination mandatory at their work places will argue that by the combine effect of Article 24(1) of the 1992 constitution and Sections 10(a) and 188(1) impose a duty on employers to ensure that every worker employed by it works under satisfactory, safe and healthy conditions. Creating a satisfactory, safe and healthy conditions include taking reasonable and practical steps to minimize or prevention the spread of Covid 19 virus at the work place. And one of the reasonable and practical steps is making Covid 19 vaccination mandatory.\\u00a0 EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO REJECT VACCINATION Whiles employers have to right to make Covid 19 policy mandatory, the Employees on the other hand also have the right to refuse vaccination. Employees have a fundamental human right which is guaranteed under the constitution to refuse or accept any medication of any sort. Therefore a person cannot be compelled without their consent to undergo medical treatment, including vaccination. On that basis, employees can also reject any attempt to compel them to undergo vaccination treatment. BALANCING RIGHT The rights of the employer and the employees indicated above, none of it can be classified as an absolute right. Therefore in the event they contradicts none will automatically takes precedence over the other. This means any potential mandatory policy cannot automatically takes precedence over an individual fundamental right and freedom to decide whether or not to take the medication. When such event happens, employers to avoid any potential liability, should be prepared to justify such policy.\\u00a0 The employer should be prepared to justified that aside the mandatory requirement there were no practical alternatives or mechanisms that was sufficient enough to meet their obligations. Another justification may be that the nature of the work employees were undertaking is such that it has become necessary that they undergo the vaccination exercise. In a decided case in Canada, specifically, employers engaged in the provision of health care and residential care services, especially those catering to the elderly or immunocompromised, it was found that it was justified in temporarily removing employees who refuse to be vaccinated. The policy must also be connected to the employer's legitimate business interest. A mandatory policy that protects employees, client and patient health and safety have been held to be legitimate business interest in other jurisdiction. WHAT EMPLOYERS MUST DO Notwithstanding that Employers may have a legitimate right to impose mandatory vaccination, it is highly recommended that they encourage voluntary vaccination. Employers can also introduce incentives to staff to encourage them to vaccinate. Further most of the vaccine hesitancy are due to little information or misinformation about the vaccination. Employers can seek help of health professionals to educate their employees about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine to alley any fears they might harbor. Notwithstanding the above, if it becomes necessary that the policy has to be implemented, the employer should ensure that the policy does not contradict with the existing employment agreement or collective agreement. The policy should also not be unreasonable. Last but not the least the policy should be clear and unequivocal.

      "      \"summary\": \"Govt's last Covid chance\\n\\nToday, the Centre for Covid19 Situation Administration (CCSA) meets to debate imposing more stringent Covid measures in Bangkok and its vicinity as well as the the four southernmost provinces in a new bid to battle Covid-19.\\n\\nIn doing so, the CCSA has deliberately avoided using the term \\\"lockdown.\\\" The measures, nevertheless, amount to a soft lockdown.\\n\\nSet to take effect for 14 days, the steps would lead to Bangkok and its vicinity being sealed off, with inter-provincial travel banned.\\n\\nEssential businesses still will be allowed to operate, while shopping malls, supermarkets and fresh markets will be asked to cut their hours. Some businesses may even be asked to close their doors for two weeks.\\n\\nPeople will be asked to stay home, and go out only when necessary such as to buy food. The quasi-lockdown measures were proposed by the Ministry of Public Health, with a clear and singular mission -- to prevent the public healthcare system from collapsing as the number of patients outstrips the capacity of state hospitals to treat them.\\n\\nThe CCSA forecasts that total Covid cases might surpass 10,000 cases per day by next week.\\n\\nThe public health crisis justifies the semi-lockdown measures despite their potential knockout effect on the economy.\\n\\nYet the Prayut government cannot afford a repeat the mistakes it made in managing the crisis over the past 18 months.\\n\\nThis time, the government must respond quickly as needs arise to inject money, soft loans, grants or even give relief items directly to affected business and workers to help them make ends meet.\\n\\nAs the 14-day Covid measure will hit daily wage workers and street vendors hardest, the government must make sure they have enough food and money to survive.\\n\\nBut the most urgent priority is for the CCSA's operations centre to work harder and smarter to control people's movements including risk groups such as labourers.\\n\\nIn past 18 months, it has failed in this crucial task. Take the persistent problem of illegal entry by migrant workers from neighbouring countries which has led to cluster infections. One glaring example came early this month when hundreds of construction workers managed to flee their camps as the state tried to lock the camps down, leading to Covid infections in more than 30 provinces. Needless to say, failure is not an option this time.\\n\\nAnd no more flip flops on vaccines. The Public Health Ministry has revised its vaccination plan regularly to accommodate the needs of the economy and the state's plans to reopen the country.\\n\\nBut as the latest Covid measures are designed with public health as the uppermost concern, the ministry must regain its focus and spend every minute it can on providing quality vaccines to vulnerable groups including the elderly, not to mention front-line workers.\\n\\nIt must also accelerate Covid testing capacity in the capital as well as build more Covid isolation and field hospitals.\\n\\nThe government has 14 days, its last chance to restore battered public confidence in its performance.\\n\\nOf course, the new quasi-lockdown will trigger debate and it is impossible for the government to satisfy everyone in a country that has been so polarised; but the government can help bridge the gap and unite people by being transparent, accountable and fair.\\n\\nAnything else, and the next 14 days could spell the end for this government.\",\n",

The vaccine also blocks animal-to-animal transmission of the virus. The findings were published July 2 in the journal Science Advances.\\n\\nThe currently available vaccines against COVID-19 are very successful, but the majority of the world's population is still unvaccinated and there is a critical need for more vaccines that are easy to use and effective at stopping disease and transmission. If this new COVID-19 vaccine proves effective in people, it may help block SARS-CoV-2 transmission and help control the COVID-19 pandemic.\\\" Paul McCray, MD, professor of pediatrics-pulmonary medicine, and microbiology and immunology at the UI Carver College of Medicine, and co-leader of the study\\n\\nUnlike traditional vaccines that require an injection, this vaccine is administered through a nasal spray similar to those commonly used to vaccinate against influenza. The vaccine used in the study only requires a single dose and it may be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures for up to at least three months. Because it is given intranasally, the vaccine may also be easier to administer, especially for those who have a fear of needles.\\n\\n\\\"We have been developing this vaccine platform for more than 20 years, and we began working on new vaccine formulations to combat COVID-19 during the early days of the pandemic,\\\" says Biao He, PhD, a professor in the University of Georgia's Department of Infectious Diseases in the College of Veterinary Medicine and co-leader of the study. \\\"Our preclinical data show that this vaccine not only protects against infection, but also significantly reduces the chances of transmission.\\\"\\n\\nThe experimental vaccine uses a harmless parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into cells where it prompts an immune response that protects against COVID-19 infection. PIV5 is related to common cold viruses and easily infects different mammals, including humans, without causing significant disease. The research team has previously shown that this vaccine platform can completely protect experimental animals from another dangerous coronavirus disease called Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\\n\\nThe inhaled PIV5 vaccine developed by the team targets mucosal cells that line the nasal passages and airways. These cells are the main entry point for most SARS-CoV-2 infections and the site of early virus replication. Virus produced in these cells can invade deeper into the lungs and other organs in the body, which can lead to more severe disease. In addition, virus made in these cells can be easily shed through exhalation allowing transmission from one infected person to others.\\n\\nThe study showed that the vaccine produced a localized immune response, involving antibodies and cellular immunity, that completely protected mice from fatal doses of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine also prevented infection and disease in ferrets and, importantly, appeared to block transmission of COVID-19 from infected ferrets to their unprotected and uninfected cage-mates.\",\n",

But the SNS24 say I cannot have it because I returned from the UK yesterday. All over the media they are saying the priority is to get people vaccinated but I cannot. I live in Portugal and was only in the UK for 11 days and the rules were changed when I was there. I quarantined for 10 days before returning to Portugal and have had 5 laboratory PCR tests in the last 12 days, all negative. I see in the news that Ant\\u00f3nio Costa had 1 PCR test and was able to leave quarantine. This is clearly a case of Politicians not wanting to adhere to their own rules. They are happy to imprison everyone else but for them it is clearly not applicable, when they should be leading by example. Don't get me wrong I am not trying to avoid doing the quarantine, I am simply wanting an exception to get my second vaccine dose which all the ministers (Cabrita, Sales etc) are reported as saying this is the nations priority. This is completely crazy, unfair and stupid, and I think this is something that needs to be reported to the public. Best regardsCRAIG ANDERSON By email\",\n",

Sadly, the program has had its challenges but ... when it comes to fatalities, deaths from COVID, that is the statistic, obviously, where Australia leads the world,' he said.'Just the other day, they had more cases in the UK in one day than Australia has had in the past 18 months. I think you've got to look at these things in balance'.A number of new western Sydney locations were added to NSW Health's list of COVID-19 exposure sites on Wednesday night, among them retail stores, cafes and supermarkets.Eleven of those are close contact sites, meaning anyone who attended at the relevant times must immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days no matter the result.The venues include Aldi and Kmart in Merrylands, both on Monday, July 5, between 1.30 and 3.30pm and Australia Post in Merrylands on July 5, from 2-3pm.Other venues include Kathmandu Burwood on July 4, from 12.35-1pm, Beds r Us Wetherill Park on July 5, between 2.30 and 3.15pm, as well as food outlets in Auburn and Smithfield.Sydney's hospitals are standing by to mobilise COVID-19 surge plans in preparation for the possible influx of people needing urgent care, with more than 10 per cent of the state's cases now in hospital.Ms Berejiklian said at the start of the pandemic NSW quadrupled its capacity to hospitalise people with COVID, including in ICU, but that she hoped the state would not have to call on that extra capacity.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"One of the most dreaded consequences of travelling in a Covid world could be about to change if a pilot program being trialled by one state is successful.South Australia will be the first jurisdiction in the country to trial a program where fully vaccinated returned residents will complete their mandatory quarantine in the comfort of their homes instead of a medi-hotel.Scott Morrison made the announcement on Friday afternoon following the national cabinet meeting. The Prime Minister said South Australians who returned from 'low-risk' countries would be able to participate in the pilot. Mr Morrison said SA indicated its interest in hosting the two-week pilot program \\u2014 which will be based on the advice from a medical panel \\u2014 at Friday's meeting. He said the project would be transparent, with all the other states and territories observing the outcome. '(This is) so they are in a position to pick up that project on the completion of a successful pilot program,' Mr Morrison said. 'We will work with them (SA) now to set up a time frame of how that will be put together and transparency arrangements for the other states and territories.'Mr Morrison said it was 'an important development' that could take significant pressure off of the quarantine system, if successful. Premier Steven Marshall said the state's response to the pandemic put it in 'an ideal position' to volunteer for the trial that would be under 'stringent safety protocols'. He said it would likely include returning Paralympians or ADF personnel who received the vaccine in Australia.'It will progress only under strict safety and surveillance measures and only when approved by our public health experts,' Mr Marshall said.'While we will be the first jurisdiction to return South Australians through home quarantine, it is expected other states will then adopt the system.'Earlier on Friday, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said both SA and NSW had previously expressed interest in participating in a small-scale trial where alternative quarantine options could be explored. 'One of the things the work done so far tells us is that a vaccinated person quarantining for seven days is stronger than an unvaccinated person quarantining for 14 days,' she told ABC radio.As part of SA's public health response, it established a dedicated Covid-19 positive medi-hotel where people who contracted the virus were transferred to complete 14 days of isolation. There are other hotels across the CBD where returned travellers whose tests were negative undergo their fortnight of quarantine. Australia is set to receive some Pfizer vaccines sooner than initially expected, but that doesn't mean under-40s will get access any time soon.Isaac Humphries has re-signed with the Adelaide 36ers for one more year in a big boost for the club.Swimmers and surfers were ejected from the water at one of Australia's most famous beaches until the danger passed.The Brisbane Lions have wasted no time in recalling James Madden after the Irish speedster's successful finger surgery.The Raiders outplayed the Sea Eagles on Thursday night and now Ricky Stuart has addressed allegations his side is fractured off the field.Ken Hinkley has downplayed Port Adelaide's inability to match it with fellow title contenders after the side's five-goal loss to Melbourne.\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"Hundreds of thousands are dead, partly thanks to the Kremlin's incompetence | Europe\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"FOR THE past year the Kremlin has trumpeted its success in fighting covid-19. It eschewed lockdowns and hailed its home-grown Sputnik V vaccine. In early June, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, boasted to thousands of guests at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, billed as the world's largest post-pandemic international gathering, that 'the current situation in Russia allows us to hold such events without any particular risk of spreading the infection.'In fact, by the time Mr Putin was addressing his powwow, Russian doctors had for several weeks been registering an alarming rise in infections and deaths. A month later, Russia is in the midst of its third and most severe wave of covid-19, with more people dying daily than at any point during the pandemic (see chart).The number of new daily cases is currently around 25,000, somewhat fewer than in Britain, and rising. But whereas in Britain this surge has translated into an average of 18 daily deaths over the past week, in Russia it has resulted in an average of 670 deaths a day.The contrast is all the more striking because Russia was the first country in the world to approve a working vaccine, one based on the same science as the British-Swedish AstraZeneca one and apparently just as effective. But whereas in Britain 78% of the population has received at least one jab, in Russia the proportion is only 20%. The difference is not the availability or the efficacy of the jab, but people's trust in the government and its vaccines.All of this could have been avoided. A year ago the government decided to lift a partial lockdown (Mr Putin called it 'a holiday'), hoping to save itself money and to prop up the president's faltering popularity after a prolonged slump in incomes. Mr Putin's ratings did go back up\\u2014but so did the risk of infection.As the second wave hit Europe in late autumn last year, the Kremlin chose not to spend money on supporting people and businesses through a new lockdown. It left people to their own devices, playing down the risks, with Mr Putin boasting about the contrast between lifeless European cities and Moscow, where restaurants, theatres and shops stayed open.But the numbers lied. By February 2021 Russia had one of the world's highest excess mortality rates, according to numbers compiled by The Economist. At that point it had registered 460,000 more deaths than normal, while its official covid-19 death toll was a more modest 85,000. But by in effect removing all restrictions and fiddling the numbers, the government managed to create a false sense of security.This was just when people should have been urged to get vaccinated, says Denis Volkov of the Levada Centre, an independent pollster. Despite the staggering true number of deaths, in February his polling found that 57% of people were not worried about catching the virus. Most worryingly, two-thirds of the country rejected the idea of getting vaccinated.The government, meanwhile, had other priorities, such as jailing Alexei Navalny, the most prominent opposition figure, and crushing street protests. This is where social-distancing rules came in handy. Mr Navalny's associates were put under house arrest for 'urging the public to violate epidemiological restrictions'. At the same time Mr Putin packed 80,000 people into the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow for a ceremony to mark the seventh anniversary of the annexation of Crimea.Many Russians concluded that the rules were merely a government ploy, to be evaded like so many of its prescriptions. They took a similarly dismissive view of the Sputnik V vaccine after its launch, with much fanfare, in early December.Sputnik V was authorised before the results of its phase-3 clinical trials were ready. Once these were published, questions were raised about some inconsistencies and data availability, says Boris Reizis, a professor of immunology at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine. Still, he says, the data suggest that Sputnik V is at least as safe and effective as other adenovirus-based vaccines, such as those made by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. But the damage had been done.To be sure, confidence in vaccines is fragile everywhere. But in Russia nobody has done more to undermine such confidence than the Kremlin and its loyal, conspiracy-peddling media. Mr Putin has hijacked Sputnik V for the purpose of geopolitical point-scoring. Yet he dithered with his own vaccination until the end of March and refused to be photographed being injected, despite his usual penchant for bare-chested publicity stunts. He has also suggested that vaccines from other countries are unsafe.That has done little to reassure the many Russians who expect their government to lie to them. They have good reason: it turns out that some people who were told they were getting Sputnik V were in fact given EpiVacCorona, another Russian vaccine praised by Mr Putin, but about which there are serious concerns. Hardly any countries have approved it.Failing to win trust, Russian authorities are resorting to sticks and carrots. In Moscow, restaurants and caf\\u00e9s are allowed to serve people indoors only if they have a QR code proving they have been vaccinated. Hospitals refuse routine treatment to anyone without a jab. Public-sector and service workers have been ordered to get vaccinated. But although more people are now signing up for jabs, there is a side-effect: a thriving black market for fake vaccination certificates, QR codes and medical exemptions. None of this bodes well for hospitals across the country, as the numbers continue to mount. \\u25a0Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub.

      "      \"summary\": \"In response to Nicholas White and colleagues, we offer these clarifications. WHO guideline development methods are prespecified, abiding by principles for producing trustworthy guidelines. The WHO COVID-19 Therapeutics Guideline Development Group (GDG) is composed of external experts, with geographical representation and gender balance, including COVID-19 survivors, ethicists, and methodologists who are vetted for potential conflicts of interest. The GDG prioritises outcomes and identifies subgroups to be considered for each recommendation, always including age and disease severity (using WHO COVID-19 definitions of non-severe, severe, and critical). As WHO guidelines need to be globally applicable, the GDG deliberately used these disease severity classifications, based on clinical indicators, to assess subgroup effects rather than stage of disease (viral and inflammatory phases). The GDG avoided using access to health care (inpatient or outpatient) to define patient subgroups because who is admitted to hospital, when, and how can differ substantially across jurisdictions.The meta-analysis team did a network meta-regression based on the prespecified subgroup variables, focusing on within-trial rather than between-trial comparisons. The GDG assessed the credibility of results from the subgroup analyses using the Instrument to assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses tool,4Schandelmaier S Briel M Varadhan R et al.Development of the Instrument to assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) in randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.CMAJ. 2020; 192: e901-e906Crossref\\nPubMed\\nScopus (0)\\nGoogle Scholar which uses structured questions to derive an overall credibility rating. Regarding hydroxychloroquine treatment for COVID-19: after assessing results, the GDG concluded there was no credible subgroup effect for disease severity and thus issued a strong recommendation against hydroxychloroquine that applied across severities. Finally, WHO has issued separate guidelines for therapeutics and prophylactic drugs, with separate analyses for these indications, thus never pooling efficacy estimates for drugs used to treat COVID-19 with estimates of effects to prevent the disease.

      "      \"summary\": \"A full movement control order has been in place nationwide since 1 June 2021. Although it has brought some respite and an easing of the pandemic in some states, the condition has been seriously worsening recently in both the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, with both areas contributing more than 60% of the new cases in the country. KL and Selangor's consistent R-naught value of above 1.0 may be reflective of increasing transmission, and the increasing cases are pushing healthcare capacities in the region to a breaking point. The spread between new cases and recovered cases that started to widen early this week (July 4) was the red alert indicating healthcare systems struggling to cope with surging cases. This prompted the authority to enhance MCO in most areas in KL and Selangor from July 3 to July 16. The overall testing intensity nationwide has been on a general decline while test positivity rate has been soaring higher (Figure 1). Figure 1: New cases, new tests and positivity rate by weeks (Data Source: Ministry of Health, Malaysia) However a breakdown of the numbers shows that some states are testing more than others, including Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. Despite Kuala Lumpur and Selangor testing more than most states (especially Selangor with testing numbers roughly 2 - 3 times that of Kuala Lumpur), the corresponding high test positive rates could indicate that the spread may already be too wide. Therefore, Selangor should focus on containment strategies and vaccination while ideally maintaining the relatively higher levels of testing. Other states, including KL, may need to increase testing alongside strict containment and vaccination. In consideration of resource allocations, we refer to our suggestion that the testing exercise ride on the vaccination campaigns, utilising the same place and manpower available. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that Kuala Lumpur and Selangor are the busiest business areas. Every day of the prolonged and stringent lockdown brings more micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) closer to the cliff. Therefore, the situation requires an urgent, strategic, multipronged and unprecedented response to not only alleviate the situation but to minimise possibility of its painful recurrence. To achieve this, EMIR Research builds on our earlier 'Exit Strategy Building Blocks for Malaysia' published on Jun 17, 2021. The three main goals remain: 1) complete lockdown, 2) extending safety net to KL and Selangor and 3) speed up vaccination. However, given the urgency of the situation whereby every day matters, we bring in new and important strategic tactic based on robust scientific evidence. Firstly, a total lockdown is crucial. If done correctly i.e, a real 'total' lockdown in KL and Selangor for at least 2 weeks to a maximum of 6 weeks as was intended at the start of MCO 3.0 will help cut transmission, slow down new infections and ease the distressful healthcare situation in these states. Secondly, extended strictness and time of the lockdown will require a deepening of the safety net for vulnerable lives and businesses in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, Among the specific recommendations which EMIR Research would like to reemphasize is the automatic opt-out loan moratorium and enhanced renters' protection for all\\u2014individuals and MSMEs in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. The basic principle of financial management tells us that it is possible to survive the income downfall if you can reduce your operating and financial leverage\\u2014this is where the Government will need to deepen its approach. Therefore, to mitigate the proposed total lockdown in Kuala Ku and Selangor, the Government should mandate and closely monitor the implementation of a true automatic opt-out loan moratorium for all with no change of terms or interest / fee charge attributed to the months of the moratorium period. This is a serious issue as some banks may still try to leverage the 'opt-in' feature. At least for Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Government should also consider changing the incentive approach with the landlords into the form of temporary law measures similar to other countries. For instance, the Government could temporarily mandate equitable co-sharing of rental obligations between the Government, landlords and tenants and make eviction illegal, at least until we transit into Phase 3 of the National Recovery Plan. The biggest share should be by the Government, followed by the landlord, and minimally (or none) born by the tenants. Lastly, but not least, is to increase the rate of vaccination as thus far it has been our best bet against the raging pandemic and the only hope for speedy return to some form of normalcy. The objective of massive vaccination is to at least protect larger proportion of population from the disease severity, hospitalizations, and deaths, even if infection was to happen. However, given, and only given the urgency of the situation, the same objective can be achieved through exploiting natural immunity to Covid-19 to win precious time and save lives and livelihoods. Notably, this idea has been mooted by the scientists since the start of 2021. To date, there are at least eight credible peer-reviewed studies published in reputable medical journals that aim to ascertain whether natural Covid-19 infection offers protection against this infection and how lasting it is. All eight studies are done in various periods during the year 2020 (before the vaccines), in various countries such as Austria [1], Denmark [2], Qatar [3], Switzerland [4], United Kingdom [5, 6], United States [7, 8]. Two were done among the healthcare workers while the rest on a nationwide samples. To trace infection or reinfection these studies used PCR tests, serological tests or both. Importantly, those who used both approaches found remarkable similarity in their results. Unanimously, these studies established the strong empirical evidence of protection from Covid-19 following natural infection (estimated efficacy ranging from 79% to 95%) lasting 7 months at average among these studies (as seen from the range of the observed period where this estimated efficacy was measured). Interestingly, both studies at the lower side of the efficacy range have been done in the medical setting where lower efficacy could be explained by higher levels of exposure to viruses and higher viral load received. Furthermore, three out of eight studies observed the protection rate increasing towards the end of observation period. Importantly, the majority of reinfections were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Only five cases of hospitalization after re-infection were reported across the studies and only one study reported 1 death out of 14,840 previously infected people, involving a 72 year old person. These findings are especially important in the view that available antibody assays measuring neutralizing antibodies may observe lowering antibody titre after a few months post infection, which is also a scenario that has been reported for Covid-19. However, the protection against severe symptoms, strong evidence of which we observe in the above studies, could be manifestation of the fact that the protection of the immune system involves more than just antibodies and include other important immune actors such as T cells and B cells, which may not be measured in current Covid-19 assays and may play an important role in what we observe. This is a well-established mechanism of immune response to many diseases. Due to significant cost involved in capturing this deeper immune response, the relevant studies are rather scarce. One such very recent longitudinal study published in Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal, assessed the immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. By continuously examining blood of 254 Covid-19 confirmed cases (age 19 to 81) the scientists established that despite antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) declined moderately over 8 months, memory B cells against SARS-CoV-2 spike actually increased between 1 month and 8 months after infection. About 95% of subjects retained immune memory at about 6 months after infection. Therefore, all these findings very plausibly suggest the possibility to exploit natural immunity and prioritise vaccination for those never been infected at least in the short-term (which can be as long as 7 months post infection) in the situation of shortage of either vaccine or time or both. The only exception should be naturally infected elderlies (as one study did find significantly lower protection of those 65 and above), people with comorbidities and those whose vascular and other vital systems have been severely damaged during the first infection. This approach also capitalises on the vast number of people infected in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, which may be excluded first, to make way for others to be vaccinated. In other words, there are justifiable grounds based on empirical studies that most of the infected people would retain infection immunity within the said months, or at least, would still have protective immunity against severe symptoms. Therefore, in practice, particularly in an extraordinary emergency setting, these individuals may be treated like 'vaccinated' individuals for a set period of time. Thus, by temporarily excluding these individuals, the target of maximising protection to the population of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor may be significantly expedited. As vaccine doses arrive in the span of the coming months, these naturally infected people that were postponed for their vaccination, can then start to receive their jabs. The efforts to increase throughput of vaccination in KL and Selangor such as door-to-door vaccination for the bedridden can also supplement the vaccine prioritisation/postponement strategy. It must be stated here that this does not mean getting infected is a good strategy, especially when we have vaccines. It is only an emergency measure in view of the need to speed up population protection and/or in the backdrop of vaccine scarcity. Fatality rates of infections without prior immunity (be it from vaccines or natural infection) appear to strongly suggest Covid-19 to be more lethal than your average flu. Some sources estimate the fatality rate is 10 times more than the common cold. Therefore, doing nothing and taking infection lightly will not be the solution and would be detrimental in the grander scheme towards recovery. Following the above tactic, while in full lockdown the authorities should start with the factories, various service companies and construction sectors in KL and Selangor as they continue to be the largest cluster contributors. Therefore, and favourably enough to this strategy, the large number of workers might be already protected with the natural immunity. The authorities may start with first screening workers IC / ID in the national epidemiological reporting system among previously PCR-confirmed cases and exclude those who are falling within the aforementioned protection period. For example, if the postponement period target is 1 month for the naturally-infected population, then we can consider only those that were infected and recovered in the last 6 months. Beyond 1 month of this strategy, the infected people can then be treated normally given the assumption that we have no vaccine supply issues and that by this time most, if not all population in KL and Selangor have been protected. For conservatism and in leaning even more towards safety, authorities may even consider a shorter period than the seven-months average duration, though the trade-off would reduce the number of eligible naturally-infected people that can be considered for exclusion. One particular aspect that has not been directly addressed by the sources mentioned or studied is the impact of new and emerging virus variants against the immunity of naturally infected and recovered people. It is postulated that these individuals may confer some level of protection against some variants (at least those that have not mutated too significantly) since natural infection may illicit not only the production of neutralising antibodies based on only one target antigen (like the spike, for example), but also triggering immune response involving other crucial immune components such as T and B cells by involving not only the spike but other parts of the virus that may be less susceptible to mutations. One way to begin elucidating and verifying this hypothesis is to also conduct antibody measurements and virus sequencing as mentioned earlier. Similar to the vaccine postponement strategy, any negative findings here may call for the approach to be reconsidered. Overall, this strategy has very calculated risk given the ample empirical support. Furthermore it can be treated as a case study and if successful extended to other states of Malaysia to near our recovery. The rakyat is suffering and it requires urgent, strategic, multipronged and unprecedented response guided by science and economic needs.

Even as the country's daily COVID count halved in the last one month, the state has been recording a steady 11,000 to 13,000 cases every day.Nearly every other state has been recording a decline in daily case count, according to a report in The Indian Express. The state breached the 15,000 mark twice this week on July 6 and 7. On Thursday, the state reported 13,772 fresh cases. The test positivity rate was at a high 10.83 percent.According to the report, in a way, the first wave never ended in Kerala as the state continued to record 5,000-6,000 cases every day in January 2021, when even Maharashtra's daily count fell to 2,000. A similar scenario seems to be playing out now.Although Kerala's new caseload has been higher, the relatively fewer deaths can be attributed to the state's better handling of the pandemic. On the other hand, the low fatality ratio of 0.47, against the country's average of 1.32, can partly be because of the large number of cases. Higher case count can also be partly attributed to better reporting, proven by serosurveys. The last national serosurvey showed that for every infection that is detected, about 25 go unreported. A similar survey in Kerala earlier this year found only about five unreported infections for every reported case.'When a person tests positive, we test all close contacts of that person, family members, etc. This kind of targeted testing is keeping the test positivity rate high,' the reported quoted Veena George, Kerala's new Health Minister.George had also said that the state always ensured that the total caseload always remained within the capacity of its health infrastructure.In the first meeting with new ministers after the cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concerns over the persistently high cases from Kerala and Maharashtra.

      "      \"summary\": \"This week the UK government announced the roadmap for the full re-opening of the events sector in England from 19 July. Events businesses will need consider the latest guidance on the use of COVID-status certification.\\n\\nOver the last year we have become accustomed to the sight of \\u2018behind closed doors' events and reduced capacity crowds, whilst a huge number of live events have of course been cancelled. Recent weeks have seen fantastic scenes with fans attending Royal Ascot, large crowds at Wembley for Euro 2020 matches and the prospect of a full Centre Court for the Wimbledon Championship finals. However these recent mass-events have all taken place under the government's pilot Event Research Programme, which mandated strict requirements of vaccination status and negative COVID tests (so called COVID-status certification or COVID-passports) as a condition for entry. For future large scale events, event organisers will need to determine their own entry requirements and policies for use of COVID-status certifications. The guidance is also apply to hospitality venues such as pubs, nightclubs and restaurants.\\n\\nThe new government guidance, which applies to England only, provides that from 19 July:\\n\\nthe use of COVID-status certification as a condition of entry for visitors to any setting will not be mandated \\u2013 event organisers and venues will be free to determine their own rules;\\n\\n'Essential settings should not use certification, but others can decide to use it at their own discretion in compliance with legal obligations' \\u2013 accordingly event organisers and venues may choose to insist upon COVID-status certification as a condition of entry. The guidance elaborates that 'Essential settings and those that have been able to stay open throughout the pandemic should not use certification';\\n\\nFor venues which choose to require COVID-status certification, the government has suggested using the NHS COVID Pass system (NHS COVID Pass for events and travel - NHS (www.nhs.uk)), which provides users with digital and paper routes to a 'Pass' if they meet one of the following criteria:\\n\\n2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in England (provided the second dose was at least 2 weeks prior)\\n\\nNegative PCR test or rapid lateral flow test within the past 48 hours\\n\\nPositive PCR test within the past 6 months\\n\\nWhilst the NHS COVID Pass system will provide a standardised and convenient way to verify COVID-status certification, operators will also be required to accept other forms of proof of status, e.g. text results of tests and paper letters.\\n\\nFollowing this guidance, venue owners and operators will need to consider:\\n\\nWhether they wish to impose any COVID-status certification requirements as a condition for entry; Processes for implementing the NHS COVID PASS system and how to cater for the needs of customers that do not have access to smartphones or other digital means; How to communicate policies and requirements to customers; Whether ticket / venue entry terms and conditions require updating to reflect any new entry policy; and Refund policies for ticket holders who no longer wish to attend or are unable to attend due to their COVID-status certification.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Ambulance staff carry the body of a COVID-19 victim in India. /AFP Ambulance staff carry the body of a COVID-19 victim in India. /AFP Editor's note: Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, political analyst and freelance reporter. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. According to data published by Johns Hopkins University on July 7, the global death toll attributed to COVID-19 had risen past 4 million. While some countries, like the United States and those in Europe, are doing far better than before thanks to their privilege in being able to secure enough vaccine doses for their populations, many countries in the Global South are still struggling.Global North countries are continuing in their unlocking plans pretty much unabated for the most part thanks to their high rate of vaccination, which, even though there are COVID-19 flare-ups across some regions, there is nowhere near the same strain on hospitals. On the upside, it means that current vaccines work and people in these parts of the world are transitioning into living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease; something which experts have long suggested was the eventual outcome of the pandemic.On the other hand, the global media and public have largely become desensitized to the staggering death toll that is continuing around the world and have lost perspective. It's true that the daily global death figure now is significantly less than the peak in January (7,900 now versus more than 14,700 at that time), but it is still 57 percent higher than the same time last year.At the same time, the 1 million death mark was reached on September 29, 2020. After that, it took around 115 days to reach 2 million, 88 days to pass 3 million, and 89 days to reach 4 million. It means that there have been far more deaths in 2021 from COVID-19 than there were in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.This is only according to official numbers. Since deaths are being driven by so-called developing countries, it's likely that they are significantly underreported and the death toll in reality is far higher. Experts believe this is the case even in so-called developed countries like the United States, which alone accounts for 15 percent of the official global death toll.This still-dire situation around the world in regards to the pandemic highlights the reality of global inequality, namely, the chasm between the Global North and Global South. While the Global North is unlocking, many parts of the Global South remain vaccine deserts untouched by the ray of hope that is inoculation against the virus. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic is by definition a global issue, allowing the Global South to go empty-handed in the final stages of this battle will inevitably backfire. Graves of whose who passed away due to the coronavirus disease are pictured at the Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus, Brazil, May 20, 2021. /Reuters Graves of whose who passed away due to the coronavirus disease are pictured at the Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus, Brazil, May 20, 2021. /Reuters As more transmissible and potentially more virulent variants of COVID-19 emerge thanks to a wide variety of vectors resulting from this vaccine inequality, these variants, which could evade an immune response, will certainly find their way into the Global North. By this logic, it is quite literally in these countries' interests to help the Global South push ahead with their vaccine drives.To be sure, this does not just mean donating vaccines from their own stockpiles as the G7 countries have already pledged. Their 1 billion pledged doses would still be woefully inadequate to meet the demand of the Global South, where most of the world's nearly 8 billion inhabitants reside.Global North countries should ramp up their vaccine production, halt unilateral sanctions that threaten supply chains in the case of the United States,\\u00a0and end the disinformation campaigns against successful vaccines produced in places like Russia, China or Cuba.Rich countries are beginning to wind down their fight against COVID-19, which is good for them, but they should not forget that the pandemic is a global issue. They have not only a moral imperative, but also a very real self-interest at stake, in furthering the global vaccine drive, especially in the Global South.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at opinions@cgtn.com.)\",\n",

Vulnerable communities most years in Fiji deal with the aftermath of cyclones and flooding desperately needing support to rebuild their homes and replace chattels. Fiji has made great strides in recent years 'building back better' following these events. Covid is different as the destruction has a greater impact on livelihoods due to loss of jobs and income as borders are closed to their main income earner tourism. Health resources are stretched leaving people in rural areas very little in the way of support. Large numbers of the most vulnerable often live in informal settlements and squatter villages. One of Rotary's partners in Fiji continues to reach out to those who have no option but to live in overcrowded accommodation including dwellings often made from cardboard, wood, corrugated iron, plastic sheeting and metal from oil drums etc. with lack of sanitation, clean drinking water and open sewers. Pollution and disease is not uncommon. A number of New Zealand based International NGO's are supporting Fiji along with Rotary. Rotary's response is at the grassroots level directly to identified communities who have not received support from other agencies.

However, the truth is that the reverse occurred. According to the RBA (Australia's reserve bank), the arrival of Covid-19 significantly increased the value of banknotes in circulation. This is similar with previous moments of economic insecurity, when people sought to accumulate cash as a precautionary store of wealth (storing currency in secure storage bags) . This trend is not unique to Australia; it has been observed in a number of other nations as well, including Japan, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, and New Zealand.\\u00a0 Feel free to read the report here https://www.acma.gov.au/publications/2020-04/report/impacts-2019-20-bushfires-telecommunications-network Digital technology does not leverage physical cash assets that can be protected using tamper evident packaging solutions. Cash's utility as a preventive store of wealth is not confined to pandemics on a global scale. Recent flooding events in New South Wales, which impacted a range of critical services, including the region's electricity infrastructure, demonstrated another significant advantage of cash: it is not leveraged by digital technology. As Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe put it, \\\"cash does not require the internet to be up, electricity to be working and the banks' systems to be operational.\\\" This failsafe is critical in an age when our crucial systems are getting more technologically advanced through the use of digital processes. Obviously, this requirement is not limited to flooding, but applies to any occurrence that has an effect on our digital systems. The bushfires of 2019-2020, which consumed more than 46 million acres and destroyed at least 3,500 homes, also had a significant impact on the country's digital networks. The Australian Communications and Media Authority stated the following about our telecommunications and internet infrastructure: (can be found here https://www.govcms.gov.au/customers/australian-comunications-and-media-authority ) During the evaluation period, 1,390 facilities were impacted by bushfires, either directly or indirectly. 51% of all afflicted facilities suffered outages lasting four hours or more during the review period, while 26% experienced outages lasting less than four hours. The average duration of outages was 3.5 days, while the median duration was 1.6 days. ACMA \\u2014 The 2019-20 bushfires' impact on the telecommunications network. Covid-19 has ingrained and heightened dread of the unknown. Returning to our initial discussion of cash holdings and Covid-19, the RBA's study reflected the same concern about digitally leveraged systems potentially dictating behavior during a pandemic. Cash holdings exceeded cash deposits in 2020, and the RBA's report indicates that, in addition to the generalised uncertainty associated with Covid-19, this particular anxiety was due to the possibility of disrupted electronic payment systems. This was demonstrated by the fact that cash withdrawals increased in March 2020 as the stormy year began to take shape. While reality looked a little different, with businesses declining cash as a safeguard for their employees and digital systems remaining operational, the anxiety was justified. There is widespread agreement that Covid-19 has instilled an underlying sense of insecurity in the global population. If someone had told us at Christmas in 2019 that we would be experiencing a catastrophic disruption to life as we know it for the following 12 months (and, when all is said and done, perhaps for the next 2-3 years), we would have laughed. Flights would be grounded, masks would be required, and residents could only leave the house for a brief period to perform errands or purchase food - we would have dismissed them as neurotic \\u2013 Nonetheless, here we are. This catastrophe will leave psychological wounds on the globe as a whole, even as the environment continues to deteriorate. When you combine the now-ingrained and heightened fear of the unknown with the possibility that future calamities may be natural in nature, destroying the physical infrastructure required for our digital systems, the concept of currency is likely to feel more secure than ever. All of this means that, in an age of technological innovation and reliance on digital systems, currency remains a stable and critical component of our economic architecture. As vaccines are distributed globally and the sun slowly rises on a post-covid world, we must remember this period as a lesson in economic insecurity... We must remember that we require ways in which we must prepare for the unexpected.Will Paton RollsPack Pty Ltd +61 3 9588 0055 email us here Visit us on social media: Facebook LinkedIn You just read: EIN Presswire's priority is source transparency.

      "      \"summary\": \"JULY 9, 2021 Updated 4 hours ago Podcast: The Detail While New Zealand and the Cook Islands are bubbling away, the Covid situation in what used to be our biggest Pacific tourism destination, Fiji, is horrifying - and out of control.\\u00a0 Fiji's Covid crisis gets worse by the day, but thousands of people are so desperate for food they risk their lives by crowding into buses without masks to get to shops and hospitals. The country, with a population of more than 900,000, had avoided Covid in the community for the first year of the pandemic. But since an outbreak in April after a quarantine breach, 7870 cases have been recorded with 40 deaths. That figure is already outdated as the numbers rise daily. \\\"We expect the situation to get far, far, far worse,\\\" says Sashi Kiran, founder of FRIEND, the Foundation for Rural Integrated Enterprises and Development. \\\"We're just mopping the floor, feeding the people, organising the medicines, trying to get people into livelihoods because we're not turning the tap off, we're not halting the virus.\\\" Today, The Detail talks to Kiran in Fiji about the poorest families on the brink of disaster because they have no jobs and no food. Up to 30,000 people have applied to FRIEND for help and every week it is getting food and medicines to 1300 families. They are low-income earners, from the ice cream seller to the juice maker and the wheelbarrow boy. They have no savings, they've been surviving more than two months with no income, and they have no national social protection. Many live in crowded squatter settlements and they are also the most vulnerable to Covid. Recently the government made a one-off $50 payment per family but Kiran says it is not enough. \\\"It barely gets you food, and then there's fuel, and then medicines. \\\"And each time there is a social protection like the $50, people line up to get the (money) and each time that happens we have thousands of people getting exposed on a daily basis.\\\" Kiran says supermarkets have become Covid hotspots and the government needs to get food trucks and caravans out to people to stop them going into towns. Before Covid struck, FRIEND was helping low-income families set up small farming and food production enterprises. Now most of its work is in Covid disaster assistance. She wants the government to change its message so that it reaches people who are most vulnerable. \\\"For example, any squatter family or any person in a village and in Nadi in particular where people were normally renting, have moved into family homes because they can't afford rent and bills. So a house may have 10 to 15 people maybe with one toilet facility. How do you avoid contact in a family like that?\\\" RNZ Pacific reporter Christine Rovoi explains to The Detail the outbreak started when two people arrived with the Delta variant from India. A soldier providing security at a quarantine facility caught the virus and was isolated but he breached protocol when he had contact with a maid. The maid and other soldiers took the virus into the community and to a funeral attended by 500 people from many parts of the country. Rovoi says the government was overconfident with its response and only locked down part of the main island, Viti Levu. \\\"I think it was a bit of being too confident about them being able to maintain such a good record. They got too cocky in a way.\\\" The response and the messaging has caused confusion, anger and anxiety, says Rovoi, and it's exacerbated by the economic crisis. \\\"To be honest, the government doesn't have any money.\\\" Late last month New Zealand announced $10 million for Fiji Covid response operations and organisations working with vulnerable households. New Zealand medical specialists are already there and others are being canvassed about doing a stint there. The government has also sent equipment including $820,000 worth of PPE gear. New Zealand is also funding the vaccination of 250,000\\u00a0people in Fiji with AstraZeneca. Sashi Kiran says her organisation and other NGOs are trying to get container loads of hospital beds, bedding and medical equipment. People who wish to donate can contact Kiran at FRIENDfiji.com.

      "      \"summary\": \"By Paula Martins, in COVID-19, News \\u00b7 09-07-2021 01:00:00 \\u00b7 0 Comments This information has been circulating on blogspots through the internet claiming that from January 2020 to April 2021 only 152 people really died of Covid-19 - instead of the 17,000 people, which are the numbers confirmed by the Directorate General of Health (DGS). This would mean that the other cases would be from people who, although tested positive for Covid-19, could have died from any other reason. However, this is completely out of context. After reading all the Lisbon court ruling (https://andre-dias.net/wp-content/uploads/Fwd-Sentenca.pdf), and analysing it very carefully, we found out that there are missing points that make all the difference. The number of 152 deaths of Covid-19, presented in the judgment, is not fake, but it is based on a wrong premise \\u2013 that all death certificates are issued by doctors who work for the Prosecutor's office (MP), because it's about these death certificates issued by doctors working in the MP that the judgment writes about. However, these doctors are not the only ones who are allowed to issue death certificates. On the contrary, normally, in case of death, the patient usually was already being followed by a doctor and it is this same professional that issues the death certificate. The MP is only called when there is something indicating a death caused by a criminal act. If the person dies at home, the doctor, who was following the patient, is called to go to that house and issue the death certificate at the location. On the other hand, if someone dies in the hospital, the hospital's doctors themselves issued that certificate. In both cases, normal doctors don't need the public prosecutor's doctors to fulfill their mission. In most cases, death has a natural cause and is a result of a diagnosed disease that evolves or worsens, of identified pathological antecedents. In these cases, the intervention of the MP is very rare, which explains the low number of death certificates issued by the MP related to Covid-19. Therefore, it does not seem strange that in a universe of 17,000 deaths by Covid-19, only 152 were certified by the doctors of the MP, as apparently people were already being followed and nothing pointed to the possibility of death due to a crime that justifies the intervention of the MP. The rule of the Administrative Court of Lisbon, in which this information comes from, began from a dispute due to the right to access to administrative information.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"By George BowdenBBC Newsimage copyrightGetty ImagesThe NHS Covid contact tracing app used in England and Wales could be made less sensitive in order to reduce the number of people asked to self-isolate.The app detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes.A source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he was considering changes, amid a huge rise in alerts.The Department of Health said the app \\\"is, and always has been advisory\\\".The system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test.Under current rules, those who receive an alert are asked to stay at home for up to 10 days.The hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs that the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge, as it could lead to millions being asked to self-isolate this summer.Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday that she was \\\"aware that people are choosing not to use the app\\\" when asked about concerns people are deleting it to avoid being \\\"pinged\\\".\\\"We are a seeing rise in cases so this is not an inconvenience, it's actually to alert people to the fact that they have been in close contact and that they may be at risk of being infected themselves and passing that infection on to other people,\\\" she said.Hinting at a change, she added that there was \\\"work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk\\\".The source close to Mr Javid told the BBC \\\"we are looking at the sensitivity of the app\\\" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before.But they did not say exactly what would change. At present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert.You can also use the app to \\\"check-in\\\" to venues so you can be notified of any positive cases you may have encountered there, although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July.Just 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June.The NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations and separate test-and-trace programmes.media captionThe NHS Covid-19 app explainedIn the last week of June, 360,000 alerts were sent through the NHS Covid app to people England and Wales, a rise of more than 60% and the highest weekly figure so far in 2021.The next highest figure, the week previously, was 219,000. As recently as the end of May, it was 16,000 a week, data showed. Between 24 June and 30 June, 281,500 people were identified as coming into close contact with someone who had tested positive, the highest number since the end of January.A BBC analysis has estimated 4.5m people could be asked to self-isolate between this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise.The government has said fully vaccinated close contacts and children will not have to self-isolate from 16 August.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the country was \\\"moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation\\\".\\\"I rely on the NHS app, as many people do,\\\" he said on Thursday. \\\"I know how difficult it has been for people and I'm sorry for the hassle that people experienced as a result of this - it is coming to an end.\\\"Most Covid rules in England are due to end on 19 July at the final stage of the country's roadmap out of lockdown, with confirmation on 12 July after a review of the latest data.The NHS app is one part of the NHS Test and Trace programme, which has a \\u00a337bn budget and also includes national testing and contact tracing infrastructure.The programme has been criticised for weak performance during the pandemic, but it has been fiercely defended by government, which has said the pandemic would be must worse without it.A further 32,551 new coronavirus cases were recorded on Thursday, alongside another 35 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\",\n",

CALHN executive lead for COVID-19 Rachael Kay said the trial marked the first stage of the outreach program. \\\"People experiencing homelessness may not be able to attend a clinic to receive their COVID-19 vaccine, so we are looking at what we can do to help get the vaccine to them,\\\" Ms Kay said.

      "      \"summary\": \"Secure youth justice facilities are supposed to provide rehabilitation for young people guilty of crimes. However, 75 percent of those detained haven't been sentenced, and nearly all of them are M\\u0101ori and Pasifika. Baz Macdonald looks at what's going on. Oranga Tamariki sign Source: RE: Across the country, four secure youth facilities are used to detain people under the age of 17 facing criminal charges. Another one is also under construction. Run by Oranga Tamariki, they are supposed to be for long-term rehabilitation of young people whose charges have been proven. However, a youth justice advocate says conditions inside do the opposite. Even worse, most of the residents haven't actually been found guilty of criminal charges. In Auckland and Christchurch, the facilities are on the same sites as adult prisons. They are ringed by high concrete walls and barbed wire fences. Young people follow a strict routine with chores, school and skills development under the supervision of social workers. If they act aggressively, they are moved into an isolated unit to cool off. Youth Justice advocate Tania Sawicki Mead from JustSpeak says the facilities 'are basically child prisons' that essentially put young people on a pathway to further interaction with the justice system. Each year, about 500 young people are sent to them. Right now, the youngest person detained is just 13, and the average age is 17. Most people stay for about 40 days, and the max stay through a youth court sentence is six months. But there are also young people who have committed crimes serious enough to be charged as an adult. They will be transferred to an adult correctional facility once they turn 18. Tania: 'What we know about secure youth justice facilities and prisons is that they increase the likelihood of them staying stuck in the justice system, rather than actually helping to change the conditions that lead them into the system in the first place.' \\u2018The talk is crime, crime, crime' The numbers support what Tania says. In 2019, an Oranga Tamariki report found 88 percent of young people placed in youth justice facilities reoffended in the next 12 months. A quarter of those re-offences were \\u2018against justice' - which most commonly means breaching a bail condition such as curfew. Notably, bail breaches have been identified as a significant factor in the cycle of reoffending. A 2019 report from the Office of the Children's Commissioner highlighted the issue, and found many young people said it 'sets them up to fail'. 'Cause you've broken the law', one young person said in the report, 'you get told what to do'. 'They should ask you what you think would work, \\u2018cause otherwise you won't stick to it.' Another interview with a 16-year-old said: 'In residence, the young ones learn the tricks from the older ones. The talk is crime, crime, crime.' In recent years there have also been reports on a range of issues with youth facilities, including reports of high rates of self-harm incidents and use of seclusion and restraint. Detained before being sentenced And while Oranga Tamariki says they have addressed these problems, the high number of young people detained in facilities before they've been sentenced remains an issue. Overall, 75 percent of young people are there on remand. Most commonly, this means they have been charged, but have not yet been sentenced or even found guilty - typically because they are awaiting a court date or have been placed there on a court order for further observation. 'These people haven't been sentenced, so there is a due process problem,' Tania says. Children's Commissioner judge Andrew Becroft has repeatedly criticised the practice. They were designed only for holding those whose charges had been proved, judge Becroft said previously. Despite that, in 2019, he noted secure youth facilities had become the default option for holding young people waiting to be sentenced. Additionally, some young people are also detained when they have nowhere safe to stay while going through the youth and district court system. Tania says more resources should be dedicated to community remand homes, where young people who get into trouble with the law can work with social workers while remaining connected with their school and family. 'Young people who don't have safe home environments are the most likely to get trapped in the justice system, but they need somewhere else safe and supportive to be,' she says. Currently, there are 17 remand homes in New Zealand, each with four to five beds. Tania says these have been effective, and further resources need to be put into them to ensure kids end up here instead of secure facilities, or even worse, a prison cell. Recent reporting from RNZ also looked into the issue, and found when police did not have access to a safe place for young people to go, they were placed in police cells. The Children's Commissioner and Green Party MP Golriz Ghamaran have called for an urgent repeal of the law enabling the youth court to remand children into police custody. Systemic racism: Up to 90 per cent\\u00a0M\\u0101ori and Pasifika The overrepresentation of M\\u0101ori and Pasifika in youth facilities is another significant problem. 80 to 90 percent of residents identify as M\\u0101ori and Pasifika - even higher than in adult prisons, where M\\u0101ori and Pasifika make up about two-thirds. Tania says these numbers reflect a racist system. 'We see this issue across the whole justice system, there is a deep issue of systemic racism in the people who are not given the benefit of the doubt,' she says. 'M\\u0101ori are subjected to much harsher or more skeptical lines of questioning. As opposed to young pakeha where diversions are considered first and foremost.' Oranga Tamariki: \\u2018It's improved a lot' Oranga Tamariki admits there have been problems in the past with young people being sent to secure youth justice facilities for minor offences. However, the agency's regional manager youth justice, Ben Hannifin, says this is now a rare occurrence - particularly following a ramp up of community remand homes from 5 to 17 since 2019. 'The intent of the youth justice system is to keep young people away from the escalation into facilities like residences and then as adults into correctional facilities,' Ben says. 'The more we can keep young people in their homes, or community facilities, the better the outcome.' According to Oranga Tamariki, the average first admission into a secure facility is five years after a person enters the youth justice system. 'They have been through diversions with the police, been through community services, and have also often been excluded from school for several years,' Ben says. 'Often the barrier that brings them in is an escalation of the seriousness of their offences. Very rarely do we receive a young person without a long history of interventions.' \\u2018It's a collection of needs' As to the high number of young people on remand in facilities, Ben says those decisions around length of stay are determined by judges. 'The remand time often extends because you pick up a lot of other complexities that can't be identified in a short amount of time - things like mental health, neurodisabilities or head injuries.' 'Those specialist reports take a long time, and so the judge might get those details and decide it is not time to release them to custodians,' Ben says. He also touches on the high number of M\\u0101ori and Pasifika in facilities, but stops short of discussing systemic racism. It's a 'collection of needs' like M\\u0101ori and Pasifika often living in lower socio-economic communities with higher incidence of drug and alcohol abuse, school dropout rates, and gang activity as a possible explanation, Ben says. Overall, Oranga Tamariki's youth facilities help prevent further interaction with the justice system, Ben says. 'A lot of the young kids we've got in our care, their brothers have been through it, their parents are in prison. There is a real sense of foregone-ness to some of these young people's stories. 'The intent of the youth justice system is to keep young people away from the escalation into facilities like residences and then as adults into correctional facilities.'\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Opawa residents are being reminded to stay vigilant and look out for each other in a bid to stem a spate of burglaries. The matter was discussed at a Linwood-Central-Heathcote Community Board meeting, which included informing residents on how to keep themselves and their homes safe via social media. It comes after a 31-year-old man was arrested last month on charges of burglary and assault, allegedly attacking a father and daughter while attempting to burgle their Fifield Tce home. Board chairwoman Alexandra Davids said members wanted to support the community affected by similar crimes that have happened recently. 'It's a stressful time for people, they don't really know what's around the corner,' she said. 'So we're trying to remind the community to stay vigilant, look out for one another, making sure they're locking their homes and being a bit more mindful that unfortunately, this is happening. 'There's not a lot the council can do, but having a platform to be able to remind the community to be vigilant is a great opportunity for us.' Additionally, several posts made by residents in the Opawa Neighbourhood Facebook page stated similar incidents involving robberies in recent weeks. One resident feared for her family's safety after thieves broke into their home while they were sleeping, stealing tools. Another resident said their child's bike was stolen from the property in broad daylight. As a result, the Christchurch South Community Patrol leapt into action as stated in a post made by a patrol spokesperson. 'We're always keeping an eye out in the community groups and have seen the recent posts. I've passed on relevant information to our patrol leader and we will increase the number of patrols in the area,' the post read. 'If anyone has any information on the robberies in the area, please let us know the times they have happened as well as the street, so we can better target our patrols.' Davids said Opawa was lucky to have community patrols that can pick up extra monitoring work when police resources can often be stretched. Although she was concerned about the type of incidents occurring in the area, the problem was not exclusive to Opawa, and that they often occurred in cycles. Said Davids: 'Burglaries and home invasions, whether influenced by gangs or petty crime, do seem to come in cycles and we do see some communities targeted from time to time. But you see it drop off as well when they change their locations. 'We're lucky to have those community patrols that do hover around and keep an eye out.' Police did not respond to questions from Star News, but the board is meeting with police in the coming weeks to discuss community concerns, including the burglaries, as well as 'issues around drinking in public,' and installing security cameras in public places. 'We're always there to advocate for the community and we welcome anyone to come up to us with their concerns, giving us the opportunity to speak to the right people,' Davids said. 'When people are looking out for each other, others looking to do something negative will be put off knowing everyone is banding together.'\",\n",

In fact, it's thought to be eight times more profitable than cocaine \\u2013 and one which has attracted organised crime. Large scale, commercial-grade cigarette smuggling operators are now well established.\\nIt's spurred on by the fact that New Zealand has the most expensive cigarettes for legal purchase in the world.\\n'With the Government set to get even tougher on the appeal and availability of legal cigarettes, there is a concern it will only lead to more illicit cigarette smuggling. It doesn't have to be the case though, particularly if smokers are activity encouraged to switch to safer nicotine products,' says Nancy Loucas, co-director of the Aotearoa Vapers Community Advocacy (AVCA).\\nTDB Recommends NewzEngine.com\\nAssociate Health Minster Dr Ayesha Verrall is now finalising the Government's Smokefree\\u00a0Aotearoa 2025\\u00a0Action Plan after releasing a discussion document for public consultation which closed on 31 May.\\nAVCA is highly supportive of getting tough on combustible tobacco given 5,000 Kiwis continue to die every year from smoking-related illnesses. It's concerned, however, that the discussion document was light on vaping's key role in achieving smokefree. It has pushed for vaping \\u2013 the world's most effective smoking cessation tool \\u2013 to feature more in the final smokefree action plan.\\n'We've got to get more Kiwis successfully off the cancer sticks in the first place, otherwise many will head to the black market. If we can switch them from cigarettes to vaping, not only will it save countless lives, but it will put a hole in organised crime,' she says.\\nThe head of AVCA says the latest media revelation exposing the sheer scale of cigarette smuggling completely discredits recent claims by University of Otago public health experts published on 27 May.\\nTitled \\u2018Illicit tobacco trade and the Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 Goal: Arguments and Evidence', the research analysis concluded that \\u2018NZ's illicit tobacco market is small and unlikely to grow substantially.'\\n'We knew they were wrong then, but they've now been proven woefully out of touch. They argue getting tougher on legal smoking won't make much difference at the border. AVCA argues it will be an absolute nightmare for Customs, unless many more smokers are actively encouraged to switch to vaping,' says Nancy Loucas.\\nAbout AVCA\\nAVCA was formed in 2016 by vapers across New Zealand wanting their voices heard in local and central government. All members are former smokers who promote vaping to help smokers quit \\u2013 a much less harmful alternative to combustible tobacco products. AVCA does not have any affiliation or vested interest in industry \\u2013 tobacco, pharmaceutical and/or the local vaping manufacturing or retail sectors.\\nwww.avca.org.nz\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Welcome to your weekly run-down of all the big news, strange rules and interesting happenings from the world of US politics.This week, crowds of Americans packed the National Mall as fireworks exploded over the country's capital city.It was July 4, Independence Day, and a special one at that. After more than a year of horror from the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 600,000 American lives, a highly-vaccinated public was gathering together to celebrate a return to normal, according to US President Joe Biden.\\\"America is back,\\\" he said.But hanging over the\\u00a0evening was the shadow of a previous gathering.The National Mall hadn't hosted a crowd that large in almost six months, not since\\u00a0the January 6\\u00a0Capitol riot, when a\\u00a0mob of Donald Trump's supporters attempted to stop Congress from certifying Biden's electoral victory.On that day, hundreds of Americans stormed the building, sending\\u00a0politicians fleeing into barricaded rooms and causing Capitol Police to fear\\u00a0for their lives.The hunt to identify perpetrators\\u00a0is ongoing.\\u00a0The FBI has a special \\\"Capital Violence\\\" page on its website with nearly 1000 pictures and videos of 300 people allegedly involved in the break-in. They're labeled \\\"unidentified\\\".The person who planted two pipe bombs outside the offices of the Democratic and Republican national committees (a move officers suspect was designed to draw them away from Congress) is still on the run.But more than 500 people have been arrested. A few dozen have pleaded guilty, including two members of the Oath Keepers militia group who admitted to conspiring with other extremists.Only one person has been sentenced so far, an Indiana woman who pleaded guilty to unlawfully entering the Capitol \\u2014\\u00a0and subsequently\\u00a0avoided jail time. After the riot, she posted on Facebook that January 6 was the\\u00a0\\\"best day ever\\\".You probably remember Jacob Chansley, the \\\"QAnon Shaman\\\". He's in federal custody awaiting\\u00a0trial on six criminal charges.He lost a bid to be released from jail\\u00a0and is undergoing a psychological evaluation to see whether he's fit to stand trial.Congressional efforts to get to the bottom of what happened aren't progressing much faster.An effort to establish a bipartisan commission flamed out, as Senate\\u00a0Republicans used the filibuster for the first time during\\u00a0the Biden administration to shoot down a bill that had majority support.Republicans who even dared entertain the notion of further examination of the attack have been turfed out of leadership positions or are now\\u00a0facing primary contests from candidates who are raising impressive sums of money.Democrats have taken the only path left available\\u00a0and created a House select committee that will investigate the attacks, but there's much we don't know about how it will work.Will it have subpoena power? How long will it have to complete its work?Will it call former president Donald Trump to testify? If he testified, what would he even say?In the time since leaving office, the former president has moved considerably in his own views of the riots.Despite reportedly calling the rioters \\\"idiots\\\" and \\\"not our people\\\" as he watched on television on the day of the attack, he softened in March to claim there was \\\"zero threat\\\" from the people who entered the Capitol.Twice this week, Trump showed a willingness to move even further from his initial stance by asking\\u00a0\\\"Who shot Ashley Babbitt?\\\" at a rally and a press conference.As New York Magazine pointed out, Babbitt \\u2014 a former air force veteran who was radicalised by QAnon conspiracy theories and killed by police on the day of the attacks \\u2014 has become a martyr among those on the\\u00a0far right, who consider her death a sacrifice in service of a greater cause.That claim now features centrally in the strategy of a former president aiming\\u00a0to regain control of US politics ahead of the 2022 midterms \\u2026 and beyond.Today, around the US Capitol, however, some of the last fences that went up in the wake of the attacks are about to come down.The metaphorical fences erected\\u00a0between corporate America and politicians who objected to the certification of Biden's victory have come down as well, with some of the richest US companies\\u00a0turning on the donation firehoses\\u00a0again.So\\u00a0it's not just public life returning to normal as the\\u00a0pandemic winds down, but also politics, just six months after an \\\"existential crisis\\\" that \\\"shocked and saddened the nation and the world,\\\" according to Biden.The battle to define that normalcy as necessary for\\u00a0the healing of the nation, or a dangerous reframing of history, is only just beginning.Election feverNew York's long and messy mayoral primary race\\u00a0is finally over.Eric Adams has been declared the winner for the\\u00a0Democrats, and is the overwhelming favourite to take the office after the general election in November.\\u00a0He\\u00a0beat Kathryn Garcia by a narrow margin of 8,400 points, or less than one percentage point, meaning candidates may still contest the results, though no one has spoken out yet.\\u00a0The close race had the city watching the numbers fluctuate with each ballot dump, especially after\\u00a0one major ballot-counting debacle.Adams only became the clear winner after 118,000 absentee ballots went through the city's ranked choice voting system -- the first time it was employed in New York history.The race is considered the most critical measure of Democratic political opinion since the 2020 Presidential primary.US media is making a lot of Adams' background in law enforcement. New York saw a spike in shootings in the lead up to polling day (it's still so bad that Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a public emergency this week).Adams' campaign struck a balanced tone \\u2014\\u00a0advocating to rein in crime while still tackling police bias and misconduct.And that brings us to\\u00a0the key takeaway from this race: As Republicans continue to accuse their counterparts of being apathetic about crime and unsympathetic to the police, Democrats everywhere will be taking notes of Adam's successful messaging.It's still\\u2026. 2016?Russian cyberattacks against US political institutions feel too common to distinguish individually\\u00a0these days, but it's worth taking note of a pair of back-to-back hackings that happened this week.A possible breach of the Republican National Committee and the infiltration that spread to an estimated 1500 global businesses are proving a big test for President Biden.It was just three weeks ago, during his first sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin, that Biden presented a list of 16 economic sectors that, if attacked, would merit retaliation.The thing is he never really said what kind of retaliation that would be. In response to reporters' questions, he said simply \\\"he knows\\\".Biden convened a group of officials yesterday (local time) to discuss strategy, but all that's come out of it is\\u00a0a promise to deliver a message to Putin. What message? We don't know?\\u00a0So when it comes to the US-Russia relationship, it still feels like we're in the Trump era. A lot of bark, no real bite.Breaking the internetWe've known that Trump and his team have been searching for an alternative to the social media services he was booted off (and is now suing).\\u00a0RIP Parler\\u00a0and the blog-that-wasn't-a-blog.\\u00a0This week delivered the next contender to the arena, and it's going about as well as you'd expect.Gettr, which is intended to operate a lot like Twitter, chose July 4 for its splashy debut, and promised to be a \\\"marketplace of ideas\\\" with no \\\"woke tyranny\\\" and would not ban users for their views.In reality, that translated to a flood of imposter accounts, anti-conservative memes and \\u2026 Sonic the Hedgehog erotica.As the ABC's technology reporter James Purtill pointed out, Gettr ran into a problem that any\\u00a0pro-Trump social media network is going to encounter: promising not to moderate content may see\\u00a0Gettr\\u00a0booted off major app stores, but being anti-moderation is key to their product differentiation.\\u00a0Perhaps it doesn't matter. Despite Gettr being run by a former Trump aide, the former president hasn't endorsed it, which probably points to its future prospects.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Source: European Parliament\\nOn Thursday, the European Parliament adopted three resolutions on the human rights situation in Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and Iran.\\n\\nHong Kong, notably the case of Apple Daily\\nParliament condemns in the strongest terms the recent forced closure of the Apple Daily newspaper in Hong Kong, the continued freezing of its assets and the arrests of its journalists. This is yet another step by Chinese authorities to dismantle free society in Hong Kong and abolish media freedom and freedom of expression there, MEPs say.\\nThe resolution also calls on the Hong Kong authorities to stop harassing and intimidating journalists, release arbitrarily detained prisoners, and denounces any attempts to muzzle pro-democracy activists and their activities.\\nWhile urging the Chinese authorities to repeal the draconian national security law introduced last year, MEPs encourage EU countries to impose sanctions against individuals and entities responsible for serious violations of human rights and international law in Hong Kong under the EU human rights sanctions regime.\\nThey also call on the Commission, the Council and EU countries to decline invitations to government representatives and diplomats to attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics unless the Chinese Government demonstrates a verifiable improvement in the human rights situation in Hong Kong, the Xinjiang Uyghur Region, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and elsewhere in China.\\nThe text was adopted by 578 votes in favour, 29 against and 73 abstentions. For further details, the full version will be available here. (08.07.2021)\\nThe death penalty in Saudi Arabia, notably the cases of Mustafa Hashem al-Darwish and Abdullah al-Howaiti\\nMEPs strongly condemn Saudi Arabia's ongoing executions of child offenders despite its claims that it has abolished such practices. This includes the recent execution of Mustafa Hashem al-Darwish for crimes that may have occurred while he was a minor following his conviction in an unfair trial and involving a confession obtained from him under torture.\\nMembers also call on Saudi Arabia to confirm that all other child offenders in the Kingdom, such as death-row inmate Abdullah al-Howaiti, will not be executed and that \\u2018confessions' extracted under torture will be excluded from their cases.\\nWhile urging the country's authorities to genuinely abolish the death penalty for these offenders, the resolution strongly supports EU sanctions against Saudi officials responsible for grave human rights violations. All EU exports of mass surveillance technology and other dual-use items to Saudi Arabia should be suspended, say MEPs.\\nThe resolution also recalls that the Saudi Sakharov Prize laureate Raif Badawi has now been in prison for nine years and urges the EU and the international community to work towards his immediate release.\\nThe text was adopted by 661 votes in favour, 3 against and 23 abstentions. It will be available in full here (08.07.2021).\\nThe case of Dr Ahmadreza Djalali in Iran\\nParliament calls on Iran, under its newly elected President Ebrahim Raisi, to halt the imminent execution of Swedish-Iranian academic Dr Ahmadreza Djalali. He must be pardoned, released immediately and unconditionally, and be allowed to return to his family in Sweden, says the text.\\nThe resolution also calls on Iran to stop threatening Dr Djalali's family in both Sweden and Iran. The charges of other arbitrarily detained EU nationals in the country must also be immediately dropped, MEPs demand. This includes German nationals Nahid Taghavi and Jamshid Sharmahd, French nationals Benjamin Bri\\u00e8re and Fariba Adelkhah, Austrian nationals Kamran Ghaderi and Massud Mossaheb, in addition to UK nationals Morad Tahbaz, Anoosheh Ashoori, Mehran Raoof and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.\\nThe Council should consider more targeted EU sanctions against Iranian regime officials and entities involved in the arbitrary detention and sentencing to death of EU nationals, MEPs urge. The text calls on Iran to release its political prisoners, including human rights defenders, as they have been arbitrarily detained solely for exercising their fundamental rights to the freedoms of expression, belief, association, publication, peaceful assembly and media freedom.\\nFor more details, the resolution will be available in full here (08.07.2021). It was adopted by 666 votes in favour, 5 against with 16 abstentions.\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"In a fierce gun battle, Haitian police have apprehended or killed the men they suspect assassinated President Jovenel Mo\\u00efse, and have begun hunting the masterminds of the plot. Two of the men arrested\\u2026\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"In a fierce gun battle, Haitian\\u00a0police have apprehended or killed the men they suspect assassinated President Jovenel Mo\\u00efse, and have begun hunting the masterminds of the plot.\\u00a0Two of the men arrested are believed to be Haitian-Americans and one of them is purportedly a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Port au Prince.Mr Mo\\u00efse, 53, was shot dead early on Wednesday at his home by what officials said was a squad of trained killers, pitching the poorest country in the Americas deeper into turmoil.Police chief Leon Charles said in a televised briefing on Thursday that authorities had tracked the suspected assassins to a house near the scene of the crime in Petionville, a northern suburb of the capital Port-au-Prince.The firefight lasted late into the night and six suspects were taken in custody, while three corpses were retrieved, he said.\\u00a0Other reports said seven people were killed while photos showed seven men in custody.\\\"We have the physical authors, now we are looking for the intellectual authors,\\\" Chief Charles said.A Haitian judge involved in the investigation said Mr Mo\\u00efse was shot a dozen times and his office and bedroom were ransacked, according to the Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste.It quoted Judge Carl Henry Destin as saying investigators found 5.56mm and 7.62mm cartridges between the gatehouse and inside the house.Mr Mo\\u00efses's daughter, Jomarlie Jovenel, hid in her brother's bedroom during the attack, he said, and a maid and another worker were tied up by the attackers.Mr Mo\\u00efse's wife was reportedly injured in the attack.Officials have not given a motive for the killing.Two\\u00a0Haitian-Americans were among those detained, said Haiti's Minister of Elections and Interparty Relations, Mathias Pierre.He identified one of them as James Solages, a US\\u00a0citizen of\\u00a0Haitian descent, but did not name the other.Mr Pierre would not provide additional details about Mr Solages's background.\\u00a0Mr Solages described himself as a \\\"certified diplomatic agent\\\",\\u00a0an advocate for children and budding politician on a website for a charity he established in 2019 in south Florida.\\u00a0On his bio page for the charity, Mr Solages said he previously worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti.The Canadian embassy did not immediately comment. Calls to the foundation and Mr Solages's associates at the charity either did not go through or were not answered.\\u00a0The US\\u00a0State Department said it was in regular contact with\\u00a0Haitian officials, including investigative authorities, to discuss how the US could provide assistance.A State Department spokesman, however, could not confirm if any US\\u00a0citizens were among those detained.Officials in mostly French and Creole-speaking Haiti said on Wednesday that the assassins appeared to have spoken in English and Spanish.A crowd of locals gathered on Thursday morning to watch the police operation unfold, with some setting fire to the suspects' cars and to the house where they had bunkered down. Bullets were strewn in the street.\\\"Burn them,\\\" shouted hundreds of locals gathered outside the police station where the suspects were being held.Chief Charles said locals helped police track down the suspects but he implored citizens not to take justice into their own hands.Earlier on Thursday, locals brought two corpses of suspected assassins to the Petionville police station.Power vacuumA 15-day state of emergency was declared on Wednesday to help authorities apprehend the killers.But interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said on Thursday it was time for the economy to reopen and said he had given instructions for the airport to restart operations.Since he took office in 2017, Mr Mo\\u00efse had faced mass protests against his rule \\u2014 first over corruption allegations and his management of the economy, then over his increasing grip on power.The assassination\\u00a0has generated confusion about who is the legitimate leader of the country of 11 million people, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.That does not bode well in a nation that has struggled to achieve stability since the fall of the Duvalier dynastic dictatorship in 1986, grappling with a series of coups and foreign interventions.Mr Joseph on Wednesday took charge of the situation, running the government response to the assassination, appealing to foreign governments for support, and declaring a state of emergency.A presidential vote as well as a constitutional referendum that had been slated for September\\u00a026 would go ahead as planned,\\u00a0Mr Pierre said.\\\"It [the vote]\\u00a0was not for Jovenel Mo\\u00efse as president: it was a requirement to get a more stable country, a more stable political system, so I think we will continue with that,\\\" said Mr Pierre, who added that preparations had long been underway and millions of dollars disbursed to carry out the votes.He said Mr Joseph would lead the country until then.\\u00a0The United Nations Special Envoy for Haiti on Thursday said Mr Joseph would remain the leader until the\\u00a0election was held, urging all parties to set aside their differences.A UN\\u00a0peacekeeping mission \\u2014 meant to restore order after a rebellion toppled then-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004 \\u2014 ended in 2019 with the country still in disarray.\\\"There are many unknowns about what happens next,\\\" said Jake Johnston, a senior research associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.\\\"But it is important to remember that that was also the case before the assassination of Mo\\u00efse.\\\"ABC/wires\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"The Fashion Lab, a first-of-its-kind in the Kingdom, is focused on sustainable fashion, contemporary design, streetwear and accessories, and nurturing new designers who are set on disrupting the fashion status quo.Applications are now open and successful participants will get to take part in a two-week 'boot camp,' which will help them navigate through different elements to develop their brand, including marketing, supply chain management, content creation and media exposure.Fashion sales in the GCC amount to around $50 billion a year, according to a McKinsey report in December 2019, with the average spent per capita amounting to around $500 in Saudi Arabia.With online fashion sales booming as a result of people stuck at home during the pandemic, Statista estimates that the Kingdom's online clothing segment will be worth $1.484 billion in 2021 and is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 5.19 percent for the next four years.Namshi, the online e-commerce site owned by Dubai's Emaar Malls, told Arab News in February it had seen 50 percent growth in revenues from Saudi Arabia in the last year and is set to expand into a new warehouse facility in Riyadh to capitalise on surging sales. While parent company Emaar Malls recently reported a 24.8 percent fall in revenues for 2020 to AED3.51 billion ($960 million), Namshi saw sales increase 28 percent to AED1.316 billion over the same period, with the Kingdom representing 70 percent of sales.On top of the $15,000 funding, applicants may also be offered equity partnerships after the program finishes at the end of the year, and may also access the Chalhoub Group's online and in-store retail network to sell their products.Dina Sidani, chief innovation officer, said that she believed the Fashion Lab 'will have long-term positive impact in promoting innovation in the fashion industry locally, while creating young fashion champions from the Kingdom for the world.'Based in Dubai, the group has been a major operator in Saudi Arabia for more than 50 years. It is active in 14 countries, with around 700 stores and 12,000 employees.Up to five brands will be selected to take part in the Fashion Lab and the deadline for submissions for the first cohort is July 25, 2021.Applications are now open and successful participants will get to take part in a two-week \\u2018boot camp,' which will help them navigate through different elements to develop their brand, including marketing, supply chain management, content creation and media exposure.The initiative is part of a wider push to develop the Saudi fashion sector and nurture homegrown brands. On Wednesday, the Kingdom's Fashion Commission announced the finalists chosen to take part in its yearlong Saudi 100 Brands program. The initiative will include training, advice and mentorship from experts in the fashion sector.A shortlist of 400 was whittled down from an initial 1,348 applicants.The program offers a one-year brand development initiative with training and mentoring, individual and group consultancy and advisory sessions, and virtual and in-person training workshops.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"The Vintage Bar is a community that connects buyers and sellers of premium and luxury secondhand fashion. By combining digital innovation, data driven technologies and inspirational branding, we take part in making fashion circular. The Vintage Bar has been setting a new fashion standard since 2017. Challenging the prevailing idea that new is always better, we work to rewrite the narrative of luxury fashion. The Vintage Bar is a marketplace, which offers pre-owned premium and luxury fashion for less. We are offering a vast selection of authenticated clothing, bags, and accessories that are competitively priced (at up to 70% off retail!). Though primarily online, we also have a showroom in Copenhagen's city center, where we are based. Through creative branding and digital innovation, we aspire to create an experience that is inspiring, inclusive and personalized. At The Vintage Bar, we prioritize authentication, accessibility, sustainability, digital innovation, and education. Through our online and social media presence, we have created a platform that informs consumers and inspires them to shop secondhand. More than just a luxury fashion marketplace, we are a community that strives to change the industry from the inside out. A Circular Fashion Universe It is no secret that the fashion industry is not sustainable. Research shows that, after oil, it is the second largest polluting industry on the planet. Due to mass overproduction and the use of harmful contaminants in its products, much of the blame has been placed on fast fashion. However, as it encourages overconsumption, luxury fashion is not devoid of fault. In 2000, European fashion companies offered on average two collections per year, but according to the European Parliament, many increased to five by 2011. Fashion has become fixated on newness. As a result, even though they are made to last, many luxury pieces are sadly left at the back of closets. As a member of the circular fashion movement, The Vintage Bar works to break this wasteful cycle. We recirculate unwanted pieces, helping to increase the lifespan of luxury fashion. Pioneering the Power of Secondhand and More Pioneering change is in our DNA. The Vintage Bar strives to dispel any negative, outdated, and ill-informed stereotypes surrounding secondhand fashion, propelling it to new levels of desirability and demand. In recent years, the fashion world has followed suit. An increasing number of designers have delved into their archives, reintroducing styles that were originally released decades ago. Vintage and secondhand fashion is now on-trend. To revolutionize the customer shopping experience, elevating secondhand to an exclusive brand experience, we use emerging technologies. Whether in our online shop or showroom, these ensure that each customer receives personalized service. We know exactly what our customers are looking for \\u2013 even if they do not themselves! We Are More Than Just a Luxury Fashion Marketplace, We Are a Community Through our editorial, known as The Archive, we offer expert insight into the brands we carry, sharing our knowledge of their heritage and craftsmanship, so our customers make informed purchases they feel confident in. Covering everything from authenticity to DIY repairs, The Archive challenges luxury fashion's culture of secrecy. Through our Instagram account (@the_vintage_bar), we engage with our community, which is over half a million and growing! Together, we celebrate secondhand fashion and inspire others to shop consciously. After just four years, The Vintage Bar has become a premier marketplace for pre-owned luxury fashion. With the help of our community, we will make secondhand the new normal. This article does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Editors or the management of EconoTimes\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Representational image\\u00a0 New Delhi: The month of July is expected to be a busy month for IPOs on Dalal Street. Many upscale fashion brands line up their initial public offer (IPO) plans to make an entry into Dalal Street. According to a report in the Economic Times, fashion labels, including Manyavar, Fabindia, GoColours, Biba Apparels seek public listings. These fashion levels are in talks with multiple investment bankers to launch their IPOs, the publication mentioned citing industry sources. Nearly all of the brands mentioned above are backed by bulge-bracket private equity investors, including Warburg Pincus and Faering Capital. According to the financial daily, Manyavar and Fabindia are planning IPOs to raise between Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 2,500 crore and GoColours is likely to enter the market with an issue size of Rs 800-900 crore. Meanwhile,\\u00a0Biba is in initial stages of talks for a public listing, bankers told ET. Vedant Fashions, owner of Manyavar, and Go Fashion (India), which operates under the GoColours brand, have already hired investment bankers to shepherd their IPOs, one of the bankers told the publication. IPOs of most of these fashion labels will include a mix of both primary issuances and offers for sale (OFS) from existing investors, including private equity players. Kedaara Capital is one of the investors in Manyavar, while PremjiInvest and Lighthouse Funds are invested in Fabindia. Private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Faering Capital have stakes in Biba Apparels, while Sequoia and ICICI Venture are large investors in Go Fashion. Worth mentioning here is that in-store sales have been hurt at exclusive fashion retailers through the pandemic, but robust web-commerce business and increased focus on casual wear helped protect these labels. It may be noted that except for Arvind Fashions, most of the listed fashion brands have seen their shares rallying over the last one year. Shares of Monte Carlo Fashions have jumped 117% in the last one year while Aditya Birla Fashion and TCNS Clothing company have gained 76% and nearly 72% respectively in the last year.\",\n",

According to Fox News, Kalman works as an art director and has collaborated with Travis Scott and Kng Kng Records, among others. Hadid was first romantically linked to the artist in early June when they were spotted out on a lunch date together. As per reports, they were apparently introduced through friends and their relationship started up following her split from on-again-off-again boyfriend The Weeknd, who sparked his own romance rumors this week after dining with Angelina Jolie. However long the pair have been dating, the model does not seem to be keeping Kalman under wraps anymore. She posted a sweet photo of them canoodling on a balcony while travelling between Paris and Cannes for the Cannes Film Festival and Paris Fashion Week. Kalman has also done projects in the fashion industry sphere, designing logo art for Made Fashion Week and fashion brand A Bathing Ape. He was also involved with a Smoke x Mirrors eyewear campaign and worked as a \\\"fashion assistant\\\" for major publications, as per his website. He is very private about his personal life and does not have public social media accounts. But his Instagram has a number of high-profile followers aside from Hadid, like Virgil Abloh, Diplo and Fai Khadra.(To receive our E-paper on whatsapp daily, please click here.

Mary Quant: Fashion Revolutionary runs until July 11, 2021 (so be quick). It tells the story of one the 20th century's most influential fashion designers, Londoner Mary Quant. Quant's daring designs revolutionised women's fashion in the 1950s and 1960s, and were entwined with the feminist movement. Her clothes shop, Bazaar, opened on Chelsea's King's Road in 1955, and from there her boutique store grew into a fashion empire. She popularised (some say invented) the mini-skirt, and brought the jersey dress into the mainstream. She also championed tights, trousers, patterned sweaters and PVC raincoats. The exhibition has over 100 garments from 1955 \\u2013 1975, and the fun and atmosphere of the swinging \\u201860s in London is brought to life through historic videos and projections. On display also is Quant's 'Daisy' fashion doll, a rival to Barbie. A savvy businesswoman, the exhibition also explores how Quant built an empire, mass-producing her clothes and breaking into far-flung markets such as Australia. Brett Whiteley: Drawing is Everything opens on July 31, 2021 and explores critical role drawing played in the creative process for the master abstract painter. Then a new exhibition from contemporary female Islamic artists, SOUL fury, opens on August 7 and explores the nature of female agency showcasing works from leading sculptors, photographers, painters, videographers and textile artists.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Thanks to Joor, a New York online platform that brands itself as 'the future of wholesale', Pippa Small carried on selling her jewellery through the pandemic. 'We use Joor to create orders for most of our accounts, such as Twist in the US and White Bird in Paris,' says Small, who has subscribed to the business-to-business service since 2014.According to Kristin Savilia, chief executive of Joor, her company's objective is to help digital transformation across 'all categories of wholesale, including jewellery'.The platform's subscribers include luxury conglomerates \\u2014 such as LVMH, Kering and Richemont \\u2014 as well as smaller designer fine jewellery brands including Ileana Makri, Wwake and Polly Wales. It allows brands to work with any retailer they do business with (and access is free for their retailers). Retailers purchasing jewellery on Joor include Harrods, Selfridges, Liberty and Net-a-Porter. They do so by visiting virtual showrooms on the platform and purchasing digitally.Tech solutions like this, across the fashion industry, have been attracting investor attention. Last month, Joor raised $46m in funding led by Australian group Macquarie. In March, Lightspeed, a Montreal ecommerce provider, entered into an agreement to buy NuOrder, of Los Angeles, the second-largest apparel wholesale platform after Joor, for $425m. During the pandemic both platforms moved into the digital trade show space, with Passport, a service provided by Joor, hosting 17 global events last year \\u2014 including London Fashion Week. Anna Jewsbury, founder of jewellery brand Completedworks, exhibited virtually through Passport at London Fashion Week. 'Retailers that were already on Joor came across our digital profile,' she says. 'They were all smaller fashion boutiques and were interested in our fashion jewellery.' Completedworks no longer wholesales its fine jewellery but sells to clients such as Alex Eagle on a consignment basis \\u2014 a commonplace practice in designer fine jewellery.Nouvelle Box of London, the first business-to-business marketplace platform tailored to jewellery, was built with both consignment and wholesale in mind. 'The pandemic was the trigger for me,' says Darren Hildrow, previously jewellery director at agency Rainbowwave, who joined Valery Demure, an industry specialist, to launch the platform in February. Nouvelle Box specialises in designer jewellery brands that straddle the worlds of fashion and jewellery, are mostly small scale and are known for setting jewellery trends.'From the outside, people see diamonds and gold and think that fine jewellery brands have a lot of money,' Hildrow explains. 'They don't. It's hard to run a small fine jewellery brand and make ends meet, so we keep the Nouvelle Box subscription within reach of small designers.'As jewellery does not work at the pace of the fashion industry, he says the role of the platform is to smooth the shift from paper to digital, by offering tools to create consignment documents and order forms all in one place. Nouvelle Box works with a range of brands, from fine diamond-focused jewellers such as Mindi Mond of New York to Capucine H, a French avant-garde designer. Broken Snowflake ring by Capucine H Alice Cicolini, one of 30 jewellery brands to have signed up so far, says that 'instead of spending time on bits of paperwork', the platform provides a relatively seamless way to do business with a group of retailers. She also hopes it will allow her to use face-to-face time to deepen retail relationships when she returns to trade shows such as Couture.The idea is that a brand displays a profile, information and collection photographs, and opts for one of three levels of visibility. They can then contact any of the 100-plus jewellery-focused retailers they don't already work with, using a LinkedIn-style messaging system. Nouvelle Box says it is as much about 'creating community' as facilitating commerce. There is a magazine area with articles by jewellery specialists and a services section that showcases vetted professionals who offer marketing, editorial, or video services. And there are plans to create a section for personal stylists who work with wealthy clients.Nouvelle Box has also joined with Ylang23, a Texas retailer, to support its Next Now award. As a result, Pari Fine Jewels, designed by Athens-born Pari Sofianou will be showcased on Nouvelle Box, free for a year.So far, the platform seems to have won over retailers because of the sense of discovery that it offers. 'While we use a variety of platforms, we generally do not rely on them for sourcing designer fine jewellery,' says Beth Kanfer, footwear, handbag, jewellery and soft accessory fashion director of store group Nordstrom. 'However, the brand curation provided by Nouvelle Box adds value as it provides access to a diverse selection of emerging brands with authenticity and limited distribution.'Ruby Beales, jewellery buying manager at Liberty, is drawn to the site because it is so targeted. 'I love that Nouvelle Box is a bespoke platform, specifically for the jewellery business. It was founded by industry experts who know just what jewellery buyers and retailers are looking for, rather than the more one-size-fits-all approach of other platforms, which tend to work with a variety of brands across all categories.'As the world opens up, many retailers and brands expect platforms to coexist and blend with physical events, such as Paris Fashion Week or Couture.\",\n",

YonhapContenders choose styles, colors to deliver deeper messages By Kang Seung-wooWhile the presidential hopefuls are busy promoting their campaign pledges, they are also trying to appeal to voters with their fashion and style, which play a role in showing who they are, as well as in helping make a good impression on voters \\u2015 which is often nearly as important as what the politicians say. Currently, the liberal ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) is going through a preliminary primary to pick its candidate for the presidential election in March next year, while the conservative main opposition People Power Party (PPP) is scheduled to start its selection process in August.Gyeonggi Province Governor Lee Jae-myung participates in a televised debate at JTBC Studios in Seoul, July 5. YonhapGyeonggi Province Governor Lee Jae-myung, one of the leading presidential contenders from the liberal ruling bloc, appears to be seeking stability in his fashion.The 56-year-old is refining his \\\"fighter\\\" image and instead displaying a polished and hard-working appearance by not dyeing his hair black as he did in 2017 but instead leaving it grey, and by wearing tight-fitting suits and metal-rimmed glasses, versus horn-rimmed ones.\\\"The governor has received advice on how to dress through various channels, but the final decision is made by his wife,\\\" said a representative of the Lee campaign. Compared to Lee, some of the other, older presidential contenders are trying to show voters a dynamic and energetic appearance, through measures such as wearing a suit without a tie. Rep. Lee Nak-yon, the former DPK chairman and former prime minister, is seeking to shift his previous dignified image by wearing bright-colored shirts and pants, along with loafers. Rep. Lee Nak-yon of the liberal ruling Democratic Party of Korea listens during a DPK preliminary primary in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, July 4. YonhapChung Sye-kyun, another former prime minister, prefers wearing blazers and pants as opposed to formal suits, without a tie, in what seems to be a move to appeal to young voters. For example, in a video clip posted on the video-sharing platform, TikTok, in June, Chung, a former six-term lawmaker, wore a leather jacket-featured cowboy outfit and hip-hop clothing with a bucket hat to convey an image of friendliness. Choo Mi-ae, the former justice minister, prefers attire that reflects the image of a career woman and a reform politician, with a short bob haircut.Using German Chancellor Angela Merkel as a benchmark, the 62-year-old often dresses in a formal way, with her top and pants the same color, and rarely wearing skirts so as to show her activeness.Rep. Park Yong-jin of the liberal ruling Democratic Party of Korea visits the nation's largest start-up support center in Seoul, July 2. YonhapRep. Park Yong-jin, 50, regarded as a leading figure of the younger generation of lawmakers, dresses in business casual attire to show that he is a young and active politician seeking to reform politics. During the first televised debate of the DPK's presidential contenders, he was the only one who dressed down, wearing cotton pants and sneakers. \\\"Given that Park is the youngest presidential hopeful in the DPK primary, he often wears casual jackets, short-sleeve T-shirts and sneakers,\\\" said a representative from the Park camp.Rep. Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative main opposition People Power Party during a press conference in Seoul, June 29. YonhapOn the conservative opposition side, Yoon Seok-youl, the former prosecutor general who is a leading presidential hopeful, drew attention during a press conference to announce his presidential bid, last month, and at another public event, by wearing a blue tie. Given that the color has represented the liberal ruling party in recent years, the choice was seen as suggesting that he is pursuing an image of unity. It also could mean that Yoon is seeking to expand his support base to centrist voters.Rep. Hong Joon-pyo of the PPP, known for his preference for the color red in his outfits, has been converting to blue as well, as the five-term lawmaker is often seen wearing blue ties and masks, in what, in his case, seems to be an effort to ease his image as a hardline conservative politician. \\\"I am trying to change my image of 'kkondae,'\\\" he confessed in a recent media interview. \\\"Kkondae\\\" refers to people who are authoritarian and always think that what they say or do is right, while ignoring others' (typically younger people's) points of view.Yoo Seong-min, a former four-term lawmaker, and Jeju Governor Won Hee-ryong, have both been wearing casual suits to give off a friendly impression, while Rep. Yun Hee-suk, who prefers to wear a black or white vest when appearing in public, is known for dressing unpretentiously, reflecting an image of being plain and unostentatious.Rep. Yun Hee-suk of the conservative main opposition People Power Party holds a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul, July 2. Yonhap\",\n",

(Yonhap)The Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Green Seoul Citizens Committee jointly hosted a fashion show behind closed doors Friday to underscore the importance of climate variability at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in central Seoul. This year's fashion show was held without an audience under the slogan 'Dealing with climate change with citizens.' Related videos will be available on YouTube. 'I would like to thank the citizens and companies for participating in making clean and useful products from reusable plastic packaging in an era where we are confronting the global warming crisis,' said Lee Dong-ryul, a senior official overseeing the city\\u2018s environmental policy.Lee added that the city government plans to attain zero net emissions of carbon by 2050. Bags made from cactus, shorts and pants made out of waste plastic water bottles and eco-friendly outfits made from natural materials and regenerated fibers were tailored to the models who strutted down the catwalk. The ethical and sustainable items showcased during the event were sponsored by various brands, including make:D and Black Yak. Around 30 models, including 10 ordinary people, senior models and university students majoring in fashion, took to the stage to lead the runway show. Since 2012, the Seoul city government and Seoul Citizen Committee for Green Seoul have paired up for campaigns under the theme of 'cool-down dressing' to encourage using less energy by wearing clothes that keep you feeling chill during the scorching summer weather.

While technology continues to reign the world today, its beautiful ruins, age-old coliseums, and awe-inspiring sculptures remind everyone of the world's ancient charm, earning it the title of the Eternal City. That is what Fendi celebrates with its latest fashion presentation. The Italian luxury house pays homage to the city by merging its old and new sensibilities in its autumn-winter 2021 couture collection. Led by English fashion designer Kim Jones, the collection showcased men's and women's pieces featuring mosaic designs, tailored suits, romantic silhouettes, and a celebration of texture and sheen thanks to delicate embroideries, recycled fur, and mother-of-pearl embellishments. \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n To present Kim's sophomore couture collection, the fashion house created a runway setup that is true to Rome's majestic landscape and architecture, which makes a perfect backdrop for its fashion film. The stylish featurette is shot by Luca Guadagnino, the 'Call Me By Your Name' director, and is inspired by Pasolini's neorealism cinema, making it a true poetic visual experience. 'Rome is a fascinating city because it has so many pasts\\u2014and I was drawn to Pasolini because I have always been inspired by his vision of the world,' says Kim. 'He is something of an outsider in Roman history, but one whose voice remains constant. I have long admired Luca's work\\u2014and he is someone who, like Pasolini, touches on subjects which are relevant to now.'

I didn't want anyone to have to choose between clean makeup they should buy and the cool makeup they want to buy.

Apart from its beautiful color, texture and design, what's great about the silky mask is it doesn't smudge your Saie makeup, not even the new super creamy Sun Melt bronzer which the team just launched to give customers that deep summer glow.\\u00a0 \\\"Beyond good makeup, we wanted to promote a good lifestyle and brand.

The designer has taken the fashion world by storm and is now positioned to make big waves with her Netflix docuseries, My Unorthodox Life.The series documents Haart's decision to leave her established life in a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish community and branch out into embracing her own passions for fashion and design.\\\"My whole life I was forced to cover myself. So basically, the only parts of my body that were showing were my hands and my face,\\\" Haart told ET's Lauren Zima as she guided ET cameras on a tour of her impressive abode. \\\"It comes from this concept that women should cover their bodies so as not to attract male attention because he may come to have impure thoughts. And my personal take on this is, 'Why is that my problem? It's not.'\\\"As Haart showed off her expansive custom closet -- inspired by the iconic closet from the classic 1995 comedy Clueless -- she reflected on how the life choice made her feel like \\\"a time traveler.\\\"\\\"I went from the 1800s to the 21st century and that's literally what it felt like,\\\" Haart explained, adding that she managed to change her life and strike out on her own through \\\"a mix of insane stubbornness and massive ignorance -- and an absolute miracle.\\\"Moving from her conservative community and out into the world of fashion, Haart began with her own namesake shoe line, before becoming the creative director for La Perla. Now, she's the co-owner and CEO of Elite World Group, a talent management group with a roster of high-powered clients and living in a penthouse in New York City.It's an appropriate locale for the mogul and mother of four, who said she was truly inspired to follow her dreams by a TV show set in the Big Apple.\\\"The first time I watched a rated R movie, I was 38 years old. [Actually], it wasn't a movie, it was actually a TV show and it was called Sex and the City,\\\" she recalled. \\\"It was [about] women living on their own. And they were making their own money, they had their own apartments, and I was like, 'Whoa, is that a thing? People do that in that world? That is unbelievable!'\\\"My Unorthodox Life, which details Haart's unique journey and ascension in the fashion world, premieres July 14 on Netflix.

      "      \"summary\": \"AC Milan was once a football titan, dominating on the pitch and shaping the beautiful game via fashion and footwork. After a few years of obscurity, it is on a mission to retrieve its cultural credentials. Casper Stylsvig, its chief revenue officer, frankly shares how he's rebuilding the Rossoneri. Can this shrewd marketer be the hero the San Siro needs?The seven-time Champions League winners are back in the tournament for the first time since 2014, having languished in mid-table mediocrity. They last won Serie in 2011. Some of its most hardcore fans weren't even born then. Stylsvig's the man tasked with changing that. His football pedigree has taken him from FC Barcelona to Manchester United and Fulham over the last 15 years. He joined a troubled AC Milan in March 2019. The Dane says: 'We control everything outside the pitch, we don't control the performance on the pitch.'His mission is to 'win football through culture' and 'attract a younger audience'. You can't just rely on on-the-pitch successes anymore, he adds. Thankfully, those have been improving swiftly.He reflects on 'a few seasons of difficulties'. In 2017, Chinese businessman Li Yonghong bought the club from Silvio Berlusconi, media mogul and three-time prime minister whose brow-raising ownership took it to immense highs and subsequent lows. Li's mission was to make China fall further in love with the club. That didn't exactly happen. Instead the team lost contact with the businessman and current owners Elliott Management took control of what The Financial Times described as a \\u2018distressed asset' \\u2013 the club was in need of a clear goal and a good assist.Stylsvig says now the club is 'doing the right things for the right reasons' and building the solid foundations of a modern football brand. He's overseen a huge digital transformation project, and exported the club on to the metaverse via Fortnite. It now manages an esports team called Qlash, hosts virtual gigs, makes waves in the fashion world and has built a media studio to accommodate growing demand from partners. Stylsvig indicates that the club is finally ready to start delivering on its legacy in the football elite. Media consumptionFootball's changed since AC Milan was at the top of the game.Stylsvig says fans consume the sport differently. He recalls his Danish childhood watching the full 90 minutes of not so-glamorous English fixtures like Wimbledon v Crystal Palace. With limited media, that was probably the best thing on TV. In 2021, it may be the worst.'The younger generation are using several screens when they watch the game \\u2013 some might favor the highlights, so we shift in how we communicate to these young fans. They want to know everything. It is no longer just about the match.'As football clubs pick up partners and become attention vehicles, many have expanded their content output to extend the window of engagement between games. Behind-the-scenes prove popular \\u2013 younger fans 'want to know everything, they want to know how professional footballers live their lives, how they train, how they eat, how they relax'.He calls this strategy 'from Monday to match day', with a goal to be relevant every day. Being in Fortnite, where the target audience is spending a lot of its time, was one approach. 'The success we saw in that partnership was just phenomenal.' Even the stadium was filled with Fortnite characters. And then there was a virtual concert a few months ago to showcase young talent. You'll see youth crop up a lot, from the outreach to the team building. It aims to have one of the youngest teams in Europe \\u2013 with the exception of statesmanlike Ibrahimovic, who's back at the club.'We're a forward-thinking club, focusing very much on innovation. It is what brands want and it is what the consumer wants. We're a football club but we are in the entertainment business. We have to give the consumers what they want or we will become irrelevant.'Stylsvig on StyleMilan, as one of the world's fashion capitals, presents an almost unique opportunity to brands. Stylsvig admits AC Milan has a headstart here, maybe only matched by PSG.'We see there is a huge link between the fashion world and the sports world. Many footballers are highly engaged in fashion, and that makes the brands interested in football.'\\nLast year AC Milan worked with fashion group Paper Planes on an exclusive collection. The club have only just started pulling on this thread. 'It was our first real fashion interaction with Paper Planes and we sold out the line in 48 hours.'Football, fashion and commerce works \\u2013 no surprise to anyone who's been offering a thick wad of notes to their favorite clubs all these years for a jersey. 'The rest of the class are still asleep but this is somewhere we will focus a lot going forward.'SocialitesInstagram's where the club sees most of its growth, and it is apparently the app where most of the fans spend their time. TikTok's becoming increasingly important and Twitch hosts a lot of activity, particularly esports output.AC Milan's also pushing on seven Chinese apps, but Stylsvig reminds us that Serie A was being broadcast on CCTV back in the 80s and 90s and that the club's always been big in China.It is worth remembering social media growth in football is often anchored to the players, who play a dual role as influencers. AC Milan is no longer a team comprised of world-class superstars \\u2013 Kaka, Shevchenko, Cafu, Dida, Nesta, Maldini, Gattuso, Van Basten, Pirlo, Inzaghi, Guilt, Weah and, undeniably atop the pile, Ronaldinho are just a few. That's no accident. 'We're taking a sensible approach here with the players we are signing. Alex Ferguson used to say: \\u2018No player is bigger than the club.''So on the pitch and off it, AC is following this mantra. On social, every player gets a fair amount of exposure. 'In player engagement we never use the same person too much. We want to give the same exposure to everyone. We believe when you're a first team, you're all on the same level.'When AC Milan was last prominent players didn't have so much power. Social media changed that. When Ronaldo moved from Real Madrid to the hated Juventus, he reportedly vacuumed 1 million followers with him and half of the club's Instagram followers. It's a risky strategy. ContentmentTo stand a chance in entertainment and hit steep revenue goals, content is key. It's cheaper and faster to do this in-house, hence the investment in a new media studio at the start of 2021.\\nDuring the pandemic, there was increased demand for content from partners. Meanwhile, when football went silent and stadiums were strictly empty, the club had to find its audience once more online.'The pandemic fast-tracked us, we needed to be much more digital-savvy.' In a year, it doubled its content output and brought aboard roughly 14 new partners during lockdown. One campaign's now a widely-distributed TikTok case study.But when pressed on why a football club like AC Milan should be a brand's go-to, instead of a content or influencer agency, Stylsvig pauses for thought. 'We are consumers but none of us like to be sold to. If you use football as a platform to gain engagement, then you might convince the consumer.'He adds: 'We hope brands buy into our big plans and innovation, and winning people through culture by merging the team with sport, fashion and design.'The strategy has the club 'back to black numbers' and out of the red after 'a few difficult years'.For now, at least, it will remain cost-conscious and do everything it can to drive revenue. It won't be splashing 'silly' money on players anytime soon, but long-time fans will probably be enthused by the stability, and if not that then perhaps the host of new content and Fortnite skins.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"What do we mean by NFTs? \\u2018Non-fungible' means that the object is unique and cannot be replaced with something else. For example, a \\u00a3 or a $ or a \\u20ac is fungible i.e., it can be traded/swapped for another \\u00a3 or $ or \\u20ac. If you were to trade a \\u2018one-of-a-kind' asset e.g., a non-fungible asset such as a video, Tweet or picture for a different asset, you would have something completely different. The token part of an NFT signifies that the asset as a digital representation on a Blockchain; initially Ethereum was used but, increasingly, we are seeing more Blockchains offering their own version of NFTs, with the huge advantage that other Blockchains can be used at a fraction of the cost of using Ethereum.Undeniably, the fashion industry is obsessed with authenticity and exclusivity. After all, this is how it is able to justify such high prices, and an NFT able to prove authenticity and exclusivity was ultimately always going to appeal to the global fashion houses. The fact that an NFT can be used in the real world (as well as the virtual world of gaming) offers a whole new market for the fashion industry to monetise its brands accordingly. An Accenture report estimates that the global gaming industry exceeds $300billion and now NFTs can be sold and traded in the gaming industry by fashion\\u00a0brands.Gucci's \\u2018Queen Bee Dionysus' bag, was originally priced at $5.50, but with clever digital marketing and promotion by being available for just an hour day on two days, its price rocketed to $4,115. It is not simply bags though, as Gucci recently auctioned a four-minute NFT video at Christie's for $25,000, demonstrating that global fashion brands are undoubtedly beginning to pay attention to NFTs! NFTS have encouraged new fashion-dedicated NFT platforms, such as Neuno, to be established for designers and allow customers to pay with credit cards and cryptocurrencies. As the magazine Vogue mentioned in a recent article, DressX is another NFT marketplace for the fashion industry.DressX\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aThe Atari Classic\\u00a0RobeSource: DressX.comInteresting to note is that John Egan, CEO of L'Atelier BNP Paribas, predicts: 'Spending on items like digital clothes and character upgrades to grow to $129 billion in 2021 from $109 billion in 2019. Because NFTs can act as a \\u2018digital twin' of a real-life garment\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aproving authenticity and provenance\\u200a\\u2014\\u200abrands like Louis Vuitton and Nike are now actively investing in blockchain technology.'Furthermore, as the publication nssmag.com has commented, there are four reasons why NFTs are attracting the global fashion\\u00a0brands:\\u2022 'An NFT can make virtual fashion items as unequivocally \\u2018signed' and unique as tangible products, solving the problem of absolute reproducibility of digital\\u00a0clothes.\\u2022 With NFTs, the field of products that can be sold as unique is widened. A fashion brand could sell the video of its show or individual backstage photos as NFTs: there may be digital copies on YouTube, for example, but the NFT makes it possible to track down the original piece, which could therefore be purchased by a collector as an original work of\\u00a0art.\\u2022 They could be used to extend the value of physical products. They could therefore act as certificates of authenticity in the form of digital artwork to reinforce the uniqueness /scarcity of a product but also as a digital copy 'associated' with the physical product and therefore usable online for the avatars of a video\\u00a0game.\\u2022 NFT as certified could have an impact on the world of resell, not only by keeping an accurate map of the changes of ownership of a certain object but also, for example, by providing brands with a percentage of royalties every time their product is sold in the secondary luxury\\u00a0market.'Whilst sales of NFTs have fallen recently from the $2billion we witnessed in Q1 of 2021, we are equally seeing more global brands entering this sector and new NFT platforms being launched\\u200a\\u2014\\u200asuch as WENEW, founded by Beeples, who sold his NFT for $69million. WENEW is an NFT marketplace for the sports industry, history and pop culture and, to coincide with Wimbledon fortnight, it is launching NFTs around the tennis player Andy\\u00a0Murray.Interestingly, also of note is that while the Chinese have recently been clamping down on cryptos such as Bitcoin (by closing mining operations in China), according to Reuters they would appear to be encouraging NFTs\\u200a\\u2014\\u200acalling them Digital Art. Alipay, which is owned by the Chinese company, Ant Group, sold 16,000 NFTs at $1.52 each within hours. The NFT buyers of the image will appear whenever they use Alipay. If NFTs remain outside the scope of the crypto crackdown in China this ought to fuel the prices of NFTs globally only further. In June 2021, the BBC reported that there was a growing trend for the Chinese to be less conspicuous with their consumption and buying of luxury fashion brands. One wonders therefore, will Chinese buyers of physical luxury goods turn their buying power to digital goods such as\\u00a0NFTs?NFT's gathering momentum in the real and virtual worlds was originally published in DataDrivenInvestor on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"THE past 15 years have proved to be quite a bumpy ride for the country's automobile industry which has seen many ups and downs since the late 2000s. The last three years have been particularly bad for the industry which is undoubtedly one of the most protected sectors of the economy. Carmakers are often criticised for the high prices of vehicles and their poor quality and missing safety features, delayed deliveries, the exorbitant premium buyers are forced to pay and so on. Read: Carmakers delaying price relief despite duty, tax cut In their defence, the manufacturers have always blamed the massive government taxes that amount to over 40pc of the total price in certain cases and very low economies of scale as only 17 out of every 1,000 Pakistanis own a car compared to 77 in Indonesia, 281 in Thailand and 70 in India. The import of cheaper, used cars under various schemes for overseas Pakistanis is also said to have suffocated local car production. While the government has made the import of used cars difficult, it has significantly cut automobile taxes in the budget to bring down their prices. The assemblers have already responded to the initiative and revised down their prices, which is expected to push car sales in the country. The rest of the issues facing the industry, according to Industries Minister Khusro Bakhtiar, will be addressed in the new Automotive Industry Development and Export Policy 2021-26 to be announced next month. From the broader details given by the minister, the new policy can be expected to push car demand, create jobs across the supply chain, incentivise local assembly of environment-friendly hybrids, encourage localisation and value addition of parts used in car manufacturing and promote exports. Additionally, the new policy will address late delivery and high premiums, as well as force manufacturers to improve safety features. But what the proposed policy does not address is just as important, if not more. Although the cuts in tax have led to a significant decrease in prices, \\u2018entry level' small cars still remain outside the reach of first-time buyers hailing from middle-income groups. Likewise, it doesn't carry incentives for foreign carmakers to take steps for the localisation of more sophisticated engines and other hi-tech parts. Nor does it make clear if the consumers will have to pay extra for new safety features. Also, there is no compulsion for foreign carmakers to introduce their models in every engine size to create healthy competition in the market and give consumers more choices at affordable and competitive prices. The automotive industry can play a big part in growing an economy. But the government must ensure that the industry doesn't focus only on profits by catering to the needs of the moneyed segments only; the middle class should also be able to afford and enjoy a better ride.

      "      \"summary\": \"Northbrook, IL -- (SBWIRE) -- 07/08/2021 -- The automotive sensors market is projected to grow from USD 24.5 billion in 2020 to USD 40.3 billion by 2025, at a CAGR 10.5% between 2020 and 2025. Increased global motor vehicle production, rise in demand for vehicle electrification, formulation of stringent government regulations related to emissions, and increase in consumer demand for safety and comfort in vehicles are the major factors driving the growth of the automotive sensors market. Based on type, the position sensors segment is projected to account for the largest size of the automotive sensors market from 2020 to 2025. Position sensors are devices that are used for position measurement in various automotive applications such as powertrain, chassis, safety & control, and among others. They can be either linear or angular. These sensors provide information to the engine control modules (ECM), which are used in vehicles for carrying out various required actions. Primary uses of position sensors include camshaft position sensing (carried out by G-sensors), crankshaft position sensing (carried out by NE sensors), and throttle position sensing, as well as fuel level and brake fluid indication.

Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids, and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles maintained their strong momentum, jumping 139.3%, with 256,000 units sold last month. NEV makers such as Nio Inc, Xpeng Inc, and BYD are expanding manufacturing capacity in China, encouraged by the government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution. China's annual NEV sales are expected to grow more than 40% in the next five years, CAAM said last month. U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc sold 33,155 China-manufactured electric cars in June.

      "      \"summary\": \"(Photo : Pexels) President Joe Biden has set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 52 percent by 2030,\\u00a0according to The New York Times. As President Biden works on steering the U.S. towards a cleaner automobile sector and safe climate, he should ignore automakers' demands for less stringent emission and fuel efficiency rules. Instead, he should reimplement auto emissions for small vehicles, SUVs, and other light trucks to five percent annually, as directed under Obama's regulations. The president is aware that\\u00a0climate change is causing more infectious diseases\\u00a0to arise, not to mention intense drought and heat waves. And he can only achieve his goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 percent by setting strict standards for automakers to fight climate change. Below are ways the auto industry can reduce carbon emissions.\\u00a0 Speed up car electrification The auto sector aims to reduce fossil fuel consumption and carbon emission through car electrification. Over the past few years, electric vehicles have proven to be excellent solutions for minimizing the impacts of global warming and enhancing air quality. However, to ensure consumers enjoy the\\u00a0benefits electric cars offer, automakers should focus on electrifying the entire automobile fleet, from public buses to taxis. They should also aim to develop advanced vehicle charging infrastructures. Increase fuel efficiency Today's car buyers are keen to find fuel-efficient vehicles when\\u00a0evaluating features of different automobile models\\u00a0at auto shops. Ideally, consumers want cars that burn fuel more efficiently, resulting in fewer carbon emissions. Moreover, the government's clean air regulations require automakers to design vehicles that emit little to zero CO2. To meet these standards, carmakers should switch their focus to develop new engines with valves that help vehicles utilize fuel efficiently. Automakers have also embraced\\u00a0innovative tech and automobile designs\\u00a0to make the car lighter, improve fuel economy, and reduce carbon emissions.\\u00a0 Recycling materials In recent years, the auto industry has adapted green business strategies, such as recycling materials, choosing alternative fuels, and designing eco-friendly car parts. By recycling materials like plastic, aluminum, and steel, the auto industry can reduce its carbon footprint significantly. Even more appealing, most car makers have formed or joined green initiative programs to transform the auto sector into an eco-friendly industry.\\u00a0 Increasing climate change concerns have forced the government to increase pressure on carbon emitters to change their business practices. Given the auto industry accounts for the largest share of CO2 emissions, the government has imposed stern measures to ensure they reduce their carbon footprint. Currently, the auto industry is reducing carbon emissions by speeding car electrification, increasing fuel efficiency, and using recyclable materials.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"By News Desk ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday launched Pakistan's first locally-made electric motorcycle (e-bike) and said the government was working on setting out an 'eco-friendly roadmap' for Pakistan to save its future generations from the negative effects of climate change and global warming.'We will devise sustainable policies on environmental protection to materialise the vision of a clean and green Pakistan,' the Prime Minister said in his address at the launch of the e-bike, here at the lawns of the Prime Minister House.Manufactured by Pakistani company Jolta Electric, the e-bike is billed as a major step towards electrifying the country's automobile industry.The launch of e-bike was part of the government's five-year Pakistan Electric Vehicles Policy 2020-2025 approved last year envisaging an ambitious electric vehicle market with a 30 percent and 90 per cent share in passenger vehicles and heavy-duty trucks by 2030 and 2040, respectively.Khan said the governments of economically strong countries 'always work on long-term policies, rather than making decisions based on election-to-election strategy to gain votes and promote mafias'.'We have to take action today to resolve the upcoming challenges,' he said, adding that deforestation and pollution are man made problems that are leading to horrendous effects on human lives.He recalled that Lahore and Peshawar, once known as the cities of gardens, are now witnessing high levels of airborne toxins which could severely affect the health of a person 'by reducing his average age by 11 years'. The Prime Minister said the government's Electric Vehicle Policy would be export-orientated to encourage economic growth by using local raw materials to manufacture indigenous products. Besides being helpful in reducing pollution, he said, the electric vehicle sector would open up an entirely new sector in the country and generate employment opportunities.He lauded Jolta Electric Executive Director Dr Muhammad Amjad and the government's team for promoting the 'futuristic' and eco-friendly policies in the country.Minister for Industries Khusro Bakhtiar said Jolta Electric was the first to launch the initiative among three companies which were given licences by the government to manufacture electric two-wheelers. He expressed confidence that the electric vehicles sector would undergo growth in the near future and mentioned that 17 more companies had shown interest in such production.He said a regulatory framework would be outlined to manage the area of electric automobiles and the related charging infrastructure. He said Africa, Central Asia and Afghanistan would be target areas for Pakistan to sell its products in line with its auto-development and export policy.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"JULY 9, 2021 | NATIONAL SUGAR COOKIE DAY | COLLECTOR CAR APPRECIATION DAY\\n\\nNATIONAL SUGAR COOKIE DAY\\nObserved each year on July 9th, National Sugar Cookie Day honors the ever-popular and delicious sugar cookie.\\nA holiday favorite and very easy to make, sugar cookies disappear quickly once they come out of the oven. Most sugar cookies include sugar, flour, butter, eggs, vanilla, and either baking powder or baking soda. While most people have the ingredients on hand at all times, some of the ingredients should be fresh for the best outcome. Children enjoy baking and decorating anytime someone makes a batch of sugar cookies.\\nThe sugar cookie is believed to have originated in the mid-1700s in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. German Protestant settlers created a round, crumbly and buttery cookie that came to be known as the Nazareth Cookie.\\nToday, sugar cookie making and decorating has become an art form for kids and adults alike. Starting with the shape of the cookie, the dough is formed with either a cookie cutter or other methods of cutting and shaping the dough. Once the cookie is baked, the cookie artist adds colored frosting or icing. Sprinkles, edible glitter, colored sugars, and additional details may be added. Some cookies receive so much detail, it's almost a shame to eat them.\\u00a0\\nHOW TO OBSERVE #NationalSugarCookieDay\\nWhile making some delicious and beautiful sugar cookies, marvel at the skill of bakers who have mastered the skill. Learn some of their tips and tricks, or share your own. We even have a delicious\\u00a0sugar cookie\\u00a0recipe\\u00a0for you to try. For more recipes, be sure to visit the National Day Calendar\\u00ae\\u00a0recipe pages\\u00a0or share one of your own. Don't forget to give a shout-out to your favorite baker and let them know you appreciate their delicious cookies. Post on social media using #NationalSugarCookieDay.\\nNATIONAL SUGAR COOKIE DAY HISTORY\\nNational Day Calendar is researching the origins of this cookie holiday.\\u00a0However, the calendar is full of cookie celebrations! Won't you check them out?\\n\\nChocolate Chip Cookie Day\\nPecan Cookie Day\\nSpicy Hermit Cookie Day\\nGingerbread Cookie Day\\nOreo Cookie Day\\nLacy Oatmeal Cookie Day\\nOatmeal Cookie Day\\nPeanut Butter Cookie Day Each year in July we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day. This day recognizes the vital role automotive restoration and collection plays in American society.\\u00a0\\nAmericans have had a fascination with automobiles since the first U.S. horseless carriage was demonstrated in 1893 by the Duryea Motor Wagon Company. The romance of the motor took us from rough country roads to iconic highways and byways. We were also able to stretch our legs and cross the country more independently than ever before. The urge to go faster, fleeter and finer were inspirations for design and ingenuity. Additionally, assembly lines made cars more affordable.\\nThe appeal of the automobile influenced the American sense of adventure. Nostalgia, perseverance, and exploration are the topics of the day. Surprisingly, the automobile and the horse shared the road for a time causing much confusion. Stop signs and signal lights were non-existent. Rules of the road were not yet established. Still, motor companies began to tailor their designs to a public demanding a particular style.\\nToday, the collectors of these bygone eras keep history and memories alive. They restore and maintain old metal, engines, and blinkers. Crank, push-button, or throttle starters once rusting in a barn rev to life. Specialists take great care to find the right part or color, and skilled artists put their hard labor to work restoring a single collector car. They spend hours on end painting, repairing, rebuilding, and welding to recreate the final result of a pristine collector car.\\nThis day recognizes those individuals dedicated to preserving a piece of American history. We associate each era with a certain car. Whether we ride in a Prohibition-era Cadillac Sedan, a 1950s era muscle car, or in our grandfather's pickup truck, they take us back.\\nHOW TO OBSERVE #CarCollectorAppreciationDay\\nGive a shout out to a dedicated restorer you know. Recognize their talent and knowledge. Attend a collector car event or show. Share your tips and videos. While you're celebrating, take a ride in your classic car. Post photos of your collector car on social media using #CollectorCarAppreciationDay.\\nCAR COLLECTOR APPRECIATION DAY HISTORY\\nSince 2009, SEMA Action Network (SAN) has sponsored Collector Car Appreciation Day. Per the request of The SEMA Action Network (SAN), each year the U.S. Senate has passed a Resolution helping to launch the day. For more information visit\\u00a0www.semasan.com.\",\n",

Total vehicle retail for the month of June'21 rise by 22.62% YoY on a low base. When compared to June'19 (a regular pre-covid month), retails are still down by -28.32%. On YoY basis, all categories were in green with 2W up by 17%, 3W up by 22%, PV up by 43%, Tractor up by 14% and CV up by a massive 236% (on a very low base due to non-availability of BS-6 vehicles). Positive momentum from June carries forward to July. With Southern India opening up, we can expect further pickup in demand. While daily infection cases have been contained offering some respite from the debilitating second wave, however, the new virus mutants and the impending 3rd wave continue to pose as risks on a longer-term, FADA said in the note on Thursday. Commenting on how June'21 performed, FADA President, Mr. Vinkesh Gulati said, 'The month of June witnessed re-opening for most of the states except the ones in South. Due to this, the industry witnessed a high pent up demand which was stuck in the system because of statewide lockdowns. While all the categories were in green, Passenger Vehicles maintains to see good demand as customers continued to show keenness in vehicles for observing social distancing and safety of their families. Two Wheeler category though in green has witnessed a softer recovery as rural market is taking time to get back from post covid stress. Commercial vehicle segment has seen a staggering growth over last year, though on a very low base as there were product shortages due to BS-6 transition. Overall, the Industry is still not out of the woods. When compared to June'19, we are still in red by -28% with 3W and CVs taking the max hit as they are down by -70% and -45% respectively. Only Tractors continue to grow as it was up 27% compared to June'19. FADA is thankful to the Government of India and previous MSME Minister, Nitin Gadkari for bringing entire Auto Retail under the ambit of MSME. This will definitely help Auto Dealers in multiple ways, may it be lower cost of financing or lower utility rates to name a few. Positive momentum from June carry forwards to July. With southern India opening up, we can expect further pickup in demand. On a longer term, Auto Industry is yet to see retail numbers comparable to FY 19. Continued global semi-conductor shortage is impacting demand \\u2013 supply mis-match thus restricting the growth of Passenger Vehicles. On one hand, while the new virus mutants and a prediction of 3rd wave in August are effecting sentiments, the revival of monsoons in July after a pause of 2 weeks and a better vaccination drive rate continues to build some hope. We will therefore have to wait and watch how the overall economy shapes up over the next couple of months. We hence see demand to be a mixed bag and hope that recovery is back on track by the time Navratri and Diwali knocks our door. Inventory at the end of June'21 o Average inventory for Passenger Vehicles ranges from 30-35 days o Average inventory for Two \\u2013 Wheelers ranges from 20-25 days\",\n",

However, growing penetration of plastic fasteners in the vehicle interior, exterior, and other uses to replace metal equivalents are projected to be the main factors contributing to the growth of the sector over the forecast period. Besides, large amount of exportation of passenger vehicles is driving the market growth for automotive plastic fasteners. According to Invest India, by 2021, India is projected to emerge as the third largest market for passenger vehicles in the world. Also, passenger vehicle sales rose by 2.70 percent in FY 2018-19 as compared to FY 2017-18. Automotive Plastic Fasteners Market Segment Analysis - Geography Asia Pacific held the largest share with 42% in automotive plastic fasteners market in 2020. Since the Asia Pacific region is the largest automotive manufacturing area, the plastic fastener industry is globally dominated in this region. China is one of the world's largest manufacturers of cars and is hence a primary buyer of fasteners. Growing demand for automotive in the emerging economies, such as China, India, Japan, and South Korea is anticipated to drive the market in the upcoming years. According to the International Trade Administration, China appears to be the world's largest automotive sector, with the Chinese government predicting that the car production will reach 35 million units by 2025. Also, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), two wheelers and passenger cars accounted for 80.8% and 12.9% market share, respectively, accounting for a combined sale of over 20.1 million vehicles in FY20. Because of the rising production and supply of plastic fasteners for automotive in this region the demand for automotive plastic fasteners market is therefore anticipated to rise in the forecast period. Automotive Plastic Fasteners Market Drivers Rising Demand for Automotive Coupled with Growing Population in Emerging Economies will Drive the Market Growth The automobile industry is one of the most important drivers of economic growth in emerging countries such as U.S., China, and India, and is one with high participation in global value chains. The growth of the automotive sector has been driven by strong government support, which has helped to carve out a unique route between the manufacturing sectors of the different regions. The automobile produced in the countries such as U.S., China, and India, uniquely cater to the demands of low- and middle-income groups of population which makes this sector stand out among the other automobile-producing countries. The increasing usage of powertrain, chassis, and wire harnessing is also rising with the growing demand of automotive. Thus, with the rising demand for automotive industry, an increase in demand for automotive plastic fasteners is being witnessed. Increasing Demand for Plastic Fasteners in Electric Vehicles The global electric vehicle (EV) industry is developing rapidly, with the result that advanced technology is now a top priority for competing OEMs and the role of automotive plastic fasteners is crucial. As the automotive industry continues to evolve and economic and environmental factors increasingly demand a move towards lower carbon emissions and sustainable solutions, electric vehicles (EV) is one of the fastest growing markets in recent years. With vehicle mass at a premium in electric vehicles (EVs), suppliers of polypropylene (PP) are developing a variety of material solutions to extract weight out from cars and increase the range of EVs, thereby reducing CO2 emissions. In this wider context around EV, the plastic fasteners are not only necessary for the vehicles themselves, but charging units, EV battery casings and general infrastructure equipment all need plastic fasteners to provide robust and secure settings. Rising demand for EVs is also one of the major factors driving the automotive plastic fasteners market growth. According to the International Energy Agency Organization (IEA), sales of electric cars rose to 2.1 million globally in 2019, surpassing 2018 \\u2013 already a record year \\u2013 to raise the stock to 7.2 million electric cars. Electric vehicles, which accounted for 2.6 percent of global car sales and about 1 percent of global car stock in 2019, increased by 40 per cent year-on-year. Download Sample Report @\\u00a0https://www.industryarc.com/pdfdownload.php?id=503470 Automotive Plastic Fasteners Market Challenges Lacking Properties of Nylon will Affect the Market Growth Plastic fasteners made from nylon are cost effective. However, different types of plastic fasteners have their shortcomings. For instance, nylon is the mostly used material for plastic fasteners; however, its lack of reliability and durability inhibits its use in applications such as automotive, which require high strength and resilience. Nylon lacks UV resistance and yellow no matter what color it has, becoming brittle and eventually decaying. They are therefore not well adapted for engineering systems and processes. Thus, there is a need for alternatives to overcome the drawbacks of various plastic materials such as nylon used in the production of plastic fasteners. Hence, the lacking properties of nylon will further create hurdles for the automotive plastic fasteners market in the forecast period.

      "      \"excerpt\": \"No Sudden Move is set in Detroit in 1954. To what extent the film, a gangster drama with only passing reference to the auto industry, has something meaningful to say about the city and its subsequent\\u2026\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"Directed by Steven Soderbergh; screenplay by Ed Solomon Steven Soderbergh's No Sudden Move, written by Ed Solomon, is a crime thriller set in Detroit in 1954. The movie's timeframe coincides with that period when the city was at the center of global automobile production and had reached its peak population, some two million people. The genre, the locale and the era are promising. Soderbergh had already made one relatively light-hearted film primarily set in the Detroit area, Out of Sight (1998). Perhaps the director would take a more serious look this time?The new work opens with a visually striking sequence in which Curt Goynes (Don Cheadle) ambles through a gray Detroit neighborhood. Just out of jail, Curt needs some fast money. A bulky Doug Jones (Brendan Fraser) offers the ex-con a considerable sum of cash for what appears to be a straightforward job.Curt becomes one member of a trio of masked men that also includes Ronald Russo (Benicio del Toro) and Charley (Kieran Culkin). Curt and Russo are assigned to watch the Wertz family at gunpoint, while patriarch Matt Wertz (David Harbour), a General Motors accountant, is forcibly escorted by Charley to retrieve documents from his boss's safe.When it emerges that the hostage situation is a set-up, Curt shoots Charley, soon realizing that he and Russo are pawns in a bigger game. Two rival mobs are involved\\u2014one black, led by Aldrick Watkins (Bill Duke), and the other headed by Italian-American Frank Capelli (Ray Liotta). The central characters replicate this divide: the soulful and relatively decent Curt makes a favorable contrast to the alcoholic, racist Russo.It takes the movie almost three-quarters of its running time to reveal a fact that will come as a shock to very few, that auto company executives are ruthless and corrupt. And furthermore, that they have police officers, such as Detective Joe Finney (Jon Hamm), in their pocket. Meanwhile, the audience is subjected to a convoluted plot that features cheating husbands, duplicitous wives and girlfriends, and gratuitous bloodshed.With stolen GM documents (blueprints for a catalytic converter, the antipollution device) in hand, Curt ultimately faces off with the head of the Consolidated Car Association, Mr. Big/Mike Lowen (Matt Damon), who coolly remarks that Curt, low man on the totem pole, has breached 'all laws of history, nature, class\\u2014no, caste' by confronting him.Undeterred, Curt upbraids Lowen and the car companies for leveling Black Bottom and Paradise Valley, 'entire neighborhoods [where] you tore up the trolley tracks and now you have this redlining bullshit everywhere. Where are the people supposed to live, Mike?' Earlier in the film the process of 'urban renewal' has been dubbed 'Negro removal.' (Black Bottom and Paradise Valley were both African-American communities in Detroit razed in the early 1960s.)Defending the theft of GM's blueprints for the pollution-reducing device, Mr. Big glibly asserts there is 'no conclusive evidence that the automobile has anything to do with the pollution level in Los Angeles, or in any other city on the planet for that matter.' A one-time executive at Ford, he complains that the latter auto giant was 'losing sales to GM. We, who invented the whole damn thing became the underdog\\u2026 'I and others like me did create these rules in this world,' Lowen goes on. 'It's money, and I have lots of money. I will continue to have more still. It's like a lizard's tail. Cut it off, the damn thing just grows back. I work, it grows. I sleep, it grows. In fact, however we end up here, I'll go home, I'll call my banker, and I will sleep like a baby tonight.' This is the most telling moment in No Sudden Move, but it does not carry a great deal of weight when the film is considered as a whole.A postscript informs us that 'in 1969, the Department of Justice filed an anti-trust case against GM, Ford, Chrysler and American Motors for 15 years of collusion to withhold the science of pollution-reducing technologies.'Auto manufacturers settled with the government and in 1976, the catalytic converter became mandatory equipment on all US automobiles. No fines were levied.' Is this then a happy ending? The problem of the film's essential thematic timidity and blandness finds expression as a triumph of style over substance. Much has been invested in creating the look, including costumes and interiors, appropriate to Detroit at the time. The opening credits pay attractive homage to the imposing, rolling credits of Hollywood films in the 1950s, backed by a soundtrack reminiscent of Henry Mancini's effort for Orson Welles' Touch of Evil (1958).But the actors find themselves at the mercy of an overly complicated and rather banal storyline, with many left to their own devices. In an interview with Esquire, Soderbergh referred to Detroit in terms that would gladden the heart of the local Chamber of Commerce and other 'boosters,' apparently bending over backward not to offend the city fathers and others who promote the falsehood that 'Detroit is back!'The filmmaker commented that the 'face of the city has changed drastically ... and [is] continuing now to go through more changes.' It's 'such a fascinating city. It's so emblematic of a certain kind of American city\\u2014one that can only exist in America. ... It's a big, sprawling city.'This is cotton candy, puffery. Detroit is ravaged, parts of it resembling a city devastated by military conflict: decaying neighborhoods, empty lots, abandoned and boarded-up buildings, closed businesses. That the filmmakers focus on catalytic converters already reduces a tragic social process to historical small change. In any event, car pollution continues to be one of the major causes of global warming, according to Sciencing website in 2018. Detroit symbolizes, above all, the long-term decline of American capitalism and its loss of global economic hegemony\\u2014and the relentless avarice of the financial aristocracy. In 1950, Detroit was the most prosperous city in the US on a per capita income basis. Today it is the poorest. Shouldn't that transition be of interest to a major filmmaker? Instead, in No Sudden Move, Soderbergh settles for creating an impressive image of one particular moment and milieu at the expense of a far fuller, richer, more contradictory picture. The decline in auto and other jobs has been a collapse. Between 1967 and 1982, Detroit lost more than half of its manufacturing jobs. Since 1989, auto-related employment in Michigan has fallen by 70 percent. Between 1950 and 2011, the number of manufacturing jobs in Detroit proper fell from 296,000 to 27,000. The city's traumatized population has paid a high price, in poverty, unemployment, homelessness, drug addiction, disease.Soderbergh continues to get many things right, except the truly important ones.

      "      \"summary\": \"Samsung SDI may cooperate with Stellantis to tap into the U.S. electric vehicle battery market. With LG Energy Solution cooperating with General Motors (GM) and SK Innovation with Ford, expectations are growing that Samsung SDI may cooperate with Stellantis, the third-largest automaker in the United States. Stellantis held Electric Vehicle Day on June 8 (local time) and took the wraps off its roadmap for electric vehicles. Just as major automakers did, Stellantis also announced a plan to secure batteries. Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest automaker, was created through a merger between the United States' Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and France's Peugeot Citroen Group (PSA). The company has a total of 14 car brands. Samsung SDI is mentioned as a possible partner of Stellantis because FCA was one of Samsung SDI's major customers before the merger. As Stellantis said it will launch all new models as electric vehicles starting from 2025, it is faced with the task to secure a stable battery supplier. Unlike LG and SK, Samsung SDI does not have a cell production plant so cooperation with Stellantines is vital to making a foray into the U.S. market, analysts say. Although Samsung SDI is supplying batteries to some electric vehicle startups such as Rivian, it is not a large-scale supply. Industry experts predict that Stellantis will soon place orders for batteries to be used for electric vehicle models such as the Jeep and the Chrysler. They predict that the amount of supply will reach 28GWh in 2024.\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"PM says master plans of cities being revised; reviews progress on development of Agri Dashboard\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan speaks at the inaugural ceremony for Pakistan's first indigenously manufactured electric bikes.\\u2014APP ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday launched production of electric motorcycles in the country and said the government was revising master plans of cities of the country to preserve green areas and provide better civic amenities to people. 'The launch of the electric motorcycle is a futuristic step as the government's electric vehicle (EV) policy defines a direction for the future. Introduction of electric motorcycles is part of the government's five-year Pakistan Electric Vehicles Policy 2020-2025, approved last year,' the prime minister said while addressing the launching ceremony of the production of electric motorcycles. He said the EV policy was part of the larger initiative of making the country clean and green. 'EVs, particularly electric motorcycles as they are used more, will have to be introduced in cities to curb pollution,' the prime minister added. 'When you decide to keep your air, water and cities clean, you have to take initiatives like the 10 Billion Tsunami programme,' he said, adding that Pakistan was one of the few countries with minimal tree cover. PM says master plans of cities being revised; reviews progress on development of Agri Dashboard\\n The salient features of the EV policy include a phased transition of the automobile industry, as it would be covering two and three wheelers and heavy commercial vehicles providing incentives to manufacturers. The E-Bike, launched by the prime minister, has been manufactured by a Pakistani company, Jolta Electric, and is considered a major step towards electrifying the country's automobile industry. The E-Bike, to be available in different models -- including JE-70, JE-70 L, JE-70 D, JE-100 L, JE-125 L, JE-Scooty and JE-Sports Bike -- is energy efficient, can be charged overnight and has features such as no clutch and gear and low maintenance. Various models of Jolta E-Bikes have different speed specifications from 10km to 60km per hour and can cover a distance from 60km to 100km after full charge. Jolta EV, an initiative of AUJ Technologies Private Limited, the EV technology provider, has designed key components of electric vehicle kits for two, three and four wheelers. It has been through five years of product designing, development and manufacturing experience in China. The prime minister said another step that the government had taken to increase tree cover was the setting up of national parks. He said it was for the first time that measures Pakistan was taking to improve environment were being acknowledged internationally. 'The world now recognises Pakistan as one of the few countries that are leading the campaign against global warming,' he noted with satisfaction Mr Khan stressed the need for long-terming planning, terming it crucial for a country's progress. 'Countries that have progressed thought about the future,' he said, giving the example of China. The prime minister said if policies of a country kept on changing from election to election, the country would have no roadmap for future. 'Policies have to be devised for long term so that we leave a roadmap for future generations,' he added. Master plans for cities The prime minister said the government was preparing master plans for cities and regretted that tree cover even in Islamabad had reduced significantly over the years due to lack of planning. 'Therefore, we are making master plans for cities, and some of these plans are due to complete in six mon\\u00adths, focusing on water treatment, discharge of waste and installation of waste treatment plants,' he said. Prime Minister Khan chaired a meeting on the progress of the Agri Dashboard and the Monitoring Dashboard for the agreements signed during his visits to foreign countries. The meeting was apprised that with real time statistics of demand and consumption, the Agri Dash\\u00adboard for agricultural commodities would help the government identify and avoid a food crisis in a timely manner. National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yousuf brie\\u00adfed the meeting on the dashboard set up to monitor implementation of the agreements reached with foreign leaders. Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh called on Prime Minister Khan and discussed the overall political situation in the province. In a meeting with Naya Pakistan Housing Development Au\\u00ad\\u00adthority chair\\u00adman retd Lt Gen Anwar Ali Haider, the prime minister appreciated the pace of development work that continued despite the pandemic.

      "      \"summary\": \"An eco-friendly auto part made with a cellulose nano-fiber Korean paper companies are speeding up development of new products to cope with\\u00a0a decline in paper demand. On July 8, Moorim P&P introduced various products made of new materials, such as nanocellulose, pulp molds and bioplastics, at Nano Korea 2021, which was held at KINTEX in Goyang City. Nanocellulose is a substance that is obtained by dividing cellulose fibers extracted from pulp into nanometer-sized pieces. It weighs only one fifth of steel but is\\u00a0five times stronger than iron and has excellent safety and hydrophilicity. Thus, it can be used in many industries, including\\u00a0automobiles, cosmetics, and electronics. In the exhibition, Moorim P&P also unveiled eco-friendly plates, lunch box containers and paper cups made of pulp molds. Pulp molds do not have plastic coating, so they are easy to recycle and biodegradable. The company also showcased samples of wood plastics and biodegradable eco-friendly bioplastic\\u00a0products developed using pulp, wood and sawdust. These materials can be used for\\u00a0hangers, toothbrushes and cosmetic cases in place of\\u00a0plastic. Hansol Paper, another Korean paper manufacture, is also stepping up its research to develop new materials for tires and automotive parts by applying nanocellulose technology. It succeeded in commercializing biodegradable paper packaging material 'Protego' and eco-friendly paper container 'Terabas.' Protego biodegrade\\u00a0more than 90 percent and can be recycled. It can be used as a packaging material for products such as cosmetics, coffee and food. Terabas, an eco-friendly food container, is attracting attention as a replacement for plastic containers because it can be recycled and biodegradable.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"(Adds official comment, details, and background) BEIJING, July 9 (Reuters) - Auto sales in China fell 12.4% in June from the corresponding month a year earlier, industry data showed on Friday, as a global shortage of semiconductors hit autos production in the world's biggest car market. Automakers around the world have had to adjust assembly lines due to the auto-chip shortage, caused by manufacturing delays that some semiconductor makers blame on a faster-than-expected recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. China's overall sales stood at 2.02 million vehicles in June, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). The country sold 12.89 million vehicles between January and June, up 25.6% from year-ago levels. Chen Shihua, a senior official at CAAM, told an online press briefing that the global auto-chip supply shortage hit China's production hard last month, but given an overall economic recovery, CAAM is still moderately positive about domestic auto market. Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids, and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles maintained their strong momentum, jumping 139.3%, with 256,000 units sold last month. NEV makers such as Nio Inc, Xpeng Inc, and BYD are expanding manufacturing capacity in China, encouraged by the government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution. China's annual NEV sales are expected to grow more than 40% in the next five years, CAAM said last month. U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc sold 33,155 China-manufactured electric cars in June.

      "      \"summary\": \"Mint & Rose sandals. Mint & Rose Designers will be the first to admit the world doesn't need more brands\\u2014and yet we crave beautiful things that make us feel good, inside and out. As shoppers, we're always searching for our next go-t0, whether in fashion or beauty. That's why many brands today are choosing to make it all, creating a full lifestyle for their customers to dive into. These four companies are doing just that, by offering natural beauty products and apparel or accessories. Saie Saie was founded in 2019 to prove that makeup can be \\\"clean, cool and unforgettable,\\\" the brand's founder and CEO, Laney Crowell, said.\\u00a0 After Crowell left her job as a fashion editor at Est\\u00e9e Lauder, she started a blog where she wrote about health, wellness and clean beauty. She was constantly testing out products, and over time she realized there was a big gap in the color market for \\\"clean products that were high performing but also had chic, fashionable branding, weren't too expensive and were thoughtful about sustainability,\\\" she said.\\u00a0 Saie Sun Melt. Saie After having many conversations with her social media followers\\u2014who were also seeking cute, affordable and clean products\\u2014she launched Saie with the mission to change the way people approach beauty. \\\"I have always been super conscious about what I put in my body and wanted to be just as sure of what I was putting on my body,\\\" she said. \\\"I was detoxing in every area of my life\\u2014nutrition, meditation and eventually beauty\\u2014but makeup was just so far behind. I didn't want anyone to have to choose between clean makeup they should buy and the cool makeup they want to buy. I wanted to create a world where both could exist.\\\" Due to her fashion background, she has also always paid close attention to style, so she said it is very important to her that Saie has chic design and packaging that makes shoppers excited to see the products in their makeup bags. Saie Sun Melt. Saie It's because of that that she decided to offer Saie merch, such as a makeup bag in the brand's signature lilac, a tote and the Saie\\u00a0x JOON lilac face mask, which is their elegant, sustainable spin on what has now become a wardrobe staple. Apart from its beautiful color, texture and design, what's great about the silky mask is it doesn't smudge your Saie makeup, not even the new super creamy Sun Melt bronzer which the team just launched to give customers that deep summer glow.\\u00a0 \\\"Beyond good makeup, we wanted to promote a good lifestyle and brand. The merchandise we offer is a reflection of that,\\\" Crowell said.\\u00a0 Mr. Smith Mr. Smith launched on November 1, 2015, in Australia, and is now available in over 10 countries across the globe. Founder David Justin said he started the brand because he wanted to develop a hair care line that reflected his own personal values: something he would feel comfortable using on himself, that was ethical, sustainable, clean and aesthetically pleasing.\\u00a0 Mr. Smith backpack. Mr. Smith \\\"Being Australian made and owned we are lucky enough to have access to a vast selection of beautiful ingredients and it would be naive of us not to capitalize on this opportunity,\\\" Justin said, speaking of his commitment to natural products. \\\"It is really important for us to know where ingredients are coming from so we can stand by their quality.\\\" The Mr. Smith team is currently in the process of setting up their own ingredients farm and growing facility in Melbourne's Mornington Peninsula. Mr. Smith hair care. Mr. Smith Apart from shampoos, hair masks and hair pigments, the brand also sells backpacks, travel totes bag and reusable shopping totes.\\u00a0 \\\"Selling merchandise is very important, as it creates a connection between the client and the brand. As a consumer myself, I love to support the brands I use in many ways, so having high-quality merchandise, such as tote bags, bandanas and toiletry bags, is very important,\\\" Justin said.\\u00a0 Mr. Smith tote bag. Mr. Smith The founder said he often takes inspiration from what he sees coming off the runways\\u2014from the hairstyles, the hair length, cut and color, to the products used. He and his teammates are also constantly taking notes on fashion industry trends and listening to customer feedback. Soon, they hope to introduce more fashion products to support their beauty launches.\\u00a0 Mint & Rose Created in California in early 2012, Mint & Rose's philosophy has always been clear: offer impeccable craftsmanship, top-quality materials, Mediterranean-inspired designs and locally-made products. Mint & Rose orange seed oil. Mint & Rose \\u00a0\\\"If we have learned something from the past year, it is that sometimes we have to slow down our pace of life a bit, stop, breathe and think,\\\" the Mint & Rose team said. \\\"Taking care of ourselves inside and out and choosing high-quality products that are as natural as possible goes along this line.\\\" Mint & Rose sandals. Mint & Rose It's because of that, they said, that they decided to increase the brand's product range and offer their community a \\\"more complete Mediterranean lifestyle.\\\" Mint & Rose orange seed oil. Mint & Rose They now offer apparel, shoes, bags, accessories and beauty products. Their most recent launch included three body oils, a hand cream and two different scented candles\\u2014all made in Spain, like their coveted espadrilles. \\\"Taking care of yourself on the inside,\\\" the team said, \\\"is also closely related to the type of products you choose to wear on the outside.\\\" Bella Skin Beauty Bella Skin Beauty founders Diana Shneider\\u00a0and Alexandra Bella just launched a cozy waffle robe made out of 100% cotton to complement their all-natural beauty line. The mother-daughter duo\\u2014known for their luxurious body oils, serums, toners, face scrubs and more\\u2014said they created the robe because they wanted their customers to have a real at-home spa\\u00a0experience. After all, the two created their company in 2019 in order to detox their bodies after Shneider suffered from health issues for years, so full-body wellness has always been top of mind. Bella Skin Beauty waffle robe. Bella Skin Beauty \\\"We want every customer to feel like they are experiencing something wonderful while using clean beauty,\\\" they said.\\u00a0 Shneider and Bella debuted the robe earlier this month and have already gotten wonderful feedback from shoppers who said their skin care routines were enhanced by it. And because they want to keep offering their customers an entire beauty experience, the founders said they are looking to introduce more loungewear and merchandise. \\\"Here at Bella Skin Beauty we absolutely\\u00a0believe that beauty and fashion go hand in hand. Both beauty and fashion are powerful categories that help us look and feel more confident,\\\" they said, adding that they want to do everything they can to make their customers \\\"feel the power of clean beauty and beautiful fashion.\\\"\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Eric Adams\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nThe Democrats have a problem:\\u00a0They have run away from their core voters.\\u00a0And they are beginning to notice and worry.\\n\\n\\n\\nLefty blogger Kevin Drum noted this recently. He observes that Republicans have moved slightly to the right, but Democrats have moved way, way to the left on social issues.\\n\\n\\n\\nDrum says he is 'personally happy' about the Democrats' move left. But he is worried, because while the Democratic Party has moved hard left, the voters it relies on to attain power haven't.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nThus, in the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump \\u2014 despite being called a white supremacist and a Hispanic-hater by all the mainstream media \\u2014 picked up black and Hispanic votes.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne reason for this is that racial polarization went down, but 'education polarization' went up.\\u00a0The Democrats are increasingly the party of the college- and graduate-school-educated white gentry class. The Republicans are increasingly the party of the working class, which includes a lot of . . . blacks and Hispanics.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust look at the issues the Democrats are pushing:\\u00a0defunding the police, which hurts mostly poor and working-class neighborhoods; critical race theory, which mostly interests woke white activists (and rich-and-guilty Dem donors) but which actually sends a message of inferiority to minority youths; gender ideology, which plays less well among the more traditional and more religious working-class minorities; environmental policies that produce higher gas prices and lower employment, while pushing food prices up; open borders that drive down wages for downscale workers;\\u00a0and so on.\\n\\n\\n\\nDonors and activists love this stuff. They live in neighborhoods that are mostly insulated from urban crime and disorder.\\u00a0Their kids will still be privileged, regardless of what theories on race are popular. Transgender issues make them feel hip and cutting-edge. Higher gas and food prices won't affect them.\\u00a0And illegal immigration makes sure they don't have to pay too much for a nannies and gardeners.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a long time, the Democrats were able to have it both ways, pretending solidarity with the working class while promoting policies that undercut it.\\u00a0But they have overdone things, and now people have noticed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe voting shift of 2020, they fear, was just the beginning.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn example is the recent Democratic Party primary in New York City, where Eric Adams triumphed over more radical opponents. In most cities Adams would be a lefty himself, but these days, simply opposing crime and disorder is enough to get you tarred as a 'conservative.'\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nAdams lost in Manhattan, the wealthiest and whitest borough in New York. He won in all the others. His support came from the working class.\\u00a0As journalist Michael Tracey tweeted, 'It's so funny that an alliance of the New York Post, ethnic whites and outer-borough blacks was the winning formula for the New York City mayoral race.'\\n\\n\\n\\nOr as Adams himself put it: 'This wasn't simply a campaign, it was a five-borough movement of working-class New Yorkers coming together for a safer, stronger, healthier city.'\\n\\n\\n\\nA safer, stronger, healthier city \\u2014 and for that matter, a safer, stronger and healthier America \\u2014 is what most voters want. It's just not what the Democrats' activist core wants.\\u00a0Otherwise, the Democrats would be supporting policies that would produce that result.\\n\\n\\n\\nThings like controlling street crime, homelessness, public defecation and drug use, etc. used to be no-brainers for politicians. How many voters, after all, are in favor of those things?\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in Mayor Bill De Blasio's New York, and in the Democrats' version of America generally, those things aren't priorities. Heck, they're not really even goals.\\n\\n\\n\\nVoters are pushing back, in the Big Apple and across the country.\\u00a0Democrats are on the defensive, going so far as to try to deny that they supported things like defunding the police, or teaching critical race theory in schools. But voters aren't that dumb.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the GOP is smart \\u2014 I know, a big if \\u2014 it will run on these issues.\\u00a0Give the voters what they want: An idea so crazy, it just might work.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Beauty supplements \\u2013 those you consume for your skin, hair or nails \\u2013 are more than just health supplements. Dr SK Tan, founder of IDS Clinic, an aesthetics clinic, says it may be better to call them skin supplements, as they 'usually contain antioxidants or vitamins shown to benefit skin'. These include photo-protection, skin barrier repair and, sometimes, skin brightening. Co-founder of supplement brand Miriqa, Winthrop Wong, who is also a pharmacist and director of Wellchem Pharmaceuticals, says supplements can benefit your beauty routine. 'The health of our skin and hair is a reflection of our diet, and inadequate intake of certain nutrients may affect our hair and skin.' Sounds good \\u2013 but isn't your daily serum or moisturiser enough? Wong says this 'dual approach' gives your skin 'optimal benefits': Apply skincare on the surface and, from the inside, supplement skin with what your body lacks from your diet. And while some ingredients do get destroyed in the stomach before they reach the intestines where they can be absorbed, here's where R&D comes in. 'Dosage of the ingredients matters,' says Wong. Two brands might use the same ingredients, but the concentration might be far more optimal in one than the other. So check the ingredients list \\u2013 the one with the higher concentration will be listed higher up. Dr Tan says you can also look out for ingredients that help with absorption, such as black pepper extract (piperine), found in IDS Lyco-White Ultra skin supplements. The patented ingredient is 'suitable for improving gastrointestinal absorption', and encourages the total use of the nutrients in the formula. Some sceptics may ask: Why can't I take multivitamins instead? Theoretically, you could. But Wong says it depends on the type of antioxidants used, how well it gets absorbed, and if it has clinically proven results. Take Miriqa Hair. It uses tripeptide collagen, which has a molecular weight small enough to be easily absorbed by the body, while Miriqa Skin uses tomatoes with colourless carotenoids, which have been backed by clinical studies as potent antioxidants for the skin. Whether you choose capsule, powder or liquid form, it doesn't matter as Dr Tan says the difference in absorption rates aren't significant. And more is not merrier either, he says. Pick what you need based on your main concerns. Wong adds that while most supplements can be taken together, some may have overlapping ingredients. To ensure that the combination stays within safe limits, check with your doctor or use the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) as a guide. New beauty supplements to try These six options feed your skin, hair and nails. Miriqa Skin contains antioxidants from non-GMO tomatoes, olive extract and l-cysteine to brighten and protect skin, while reducing flare-ups. Miriqa Hair contains tripeptide collagen, tocotrienol, biotin, saw palmetto berries and keratin forte to improve hair health. At www.miriqa.com 2.

      "      \"summary\": \"July 09, 2021published at 4:57 AMByPei YingRenonation.sg The minimalist style, while somewhat off the radar in the interior design scene for a while, is now back on trend. And homes in Singapore have embraced it more than ever. Sometimes surreal, often serene, but always stylish, minimalist homes are the answer to our very hectic and cluttered lives. They may look easy to design, but a well-thought-out minimalist sanctuary requires plenty of attention to details. We seek out some of the best, highlighting the details that have gone into the design of these minimalist homes. 1. Bishan Apartment by D' Initial Concept Design highlights : White plastered walls with recessed shelving in the living room and the bedroom offer display and storage space. Minimalist design, but making a strong visual statement with curves and arches. You see it in the arches to break up the lines in the communal areas, customised curved doors, the curved kitchen peninsula counter, the curved-edge shoe cabinet bench, and the curved privacy screen in the bedroom. Unlike the rest of the spaces, which come with screed-like flooring, the kitchen features wood flooring to warm things up in the cooking space. Textiles and a gorgeous solid wood dining table were used to create warmth in the rest of the space. 2. Sumang Walk Apartment by The Local Inn.terior Design highlights : Lots of cleverly hidden lighting to create mood, design interest and warmth in this neutral-hued home. Our favourite has to be the hallway's recessed lights and the foyer's concealed lighting. Concealed storage panels near the entrance of the home to hide away clutter and everyday life. The TV wall, with the TV and media units recessed, features a curved element to break up the expected. A dedicated vanity space concealed within the walk-in wardrobe in the master bedroom. 3. Bukit Panjang Apartment by In-Expat Design highlights : A monochrome theme, the epitome of minimalism. The dining space is defined by swathing the nearby walls black. Thanks to its location near the window, this eating area doesn't feel too closed in or dark. Wood floors and furniture, greenery and leather furniture bring a sense of nature into the home. Metallic finishes throughout the flat lend a sense of opulence. Worthy of note are the custom wardrobe handles as well as the painted glass kitchen backsplash. ALSO READ:\\u00a07 luxe minimalist homes in Singapore that we wish were ours 4. Yishun Apartment by Kuro+Kagi Design highlights : Rather than interpret minimalism as an absence of colour, this designer made use of warm and subtle hues, including olive, navy and mustard, to enliven this minimalist space. Wood was also predominantly used amidst the white foundation to create textural interest and to bring in warmth. Recessed shelves in the living room feature a wood base to draw parallels to the wood-clad built-in storage located next to them. Floors are cement screed for a pared-back look. In the bedroom, the bed sits atop a wooden platform that features a lean table by the side to serve as a nightstand and a casual workstation. Rather than opt for off-the-rack pulls or knobs, the cabinet and wardrobe handles were specially designed and crafted from the same carpentry work in line with the minimalist style. 5. Bukit Panjang Apartment by Authors Interior & Styling Design highlights : Using light woods and white to bring about a soothing atmosphere to this home. The kitchen cabinet handles were designed to run the length of the cabinet so they appear like an extra design detail rather than a handle. Part of the island features fluted details for extra interest. The edge is carved out as legroom in order to provide a comfortable spot for casual dining. A hefty marble grain vanity offers a sense of luxury amidst the black-and-white bathroom. 6. Henderson Apartment by Van Hus Interior Design Design highlights : In the living room, the study is enclosed behind full glass panels. The black borders offer extra support for safety without impeding the sleek appearance. A granite backsplash pops against the chic, all-black kitchen. This style is similarly replicated in the bathroom, with the marble grain vanity counter as well as the recessed shower shelves. Long strips of LED lights are found throughout the home, lending form as much as function. The built-in wardrobe is embedded with an ironing board, making it extra convenient to stow away clothes after ironing. The wardrobe also features a vertical strip of open compartments for displaying the homeowner's collection of designer bags. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Feel comfy and productive at home with these minimalist 'infit' picks 7. Apartment by The Association Design highlights : To make the entrance into the bedroom less jarring in the living room, the door was made to blend in with the fluted TV feature wall. This was similarly done for the common bathroom entrance in the kitchen. A variety of wood tones and textures were used to avoid a monotonous look in the apartment. The kitchen is a minimalist, sleek space, with a single island dominating the area. The full-height storage, concealed home bar and pantry (behind pocket doors) and the built-in appliances keep it looking neat and clutter-free. Fluted details appear once again in the bathroom, standing out against the concrete-like tiles. A petite workstation was designed at the end of the built-in wardrobe in the bedroom.

      "      \"summary\": \"Buying a pre-owned car is a rational choice in the face of Singapore's high car prices, but doing so is not without its pitfalls.\\u00a0 Second-hand cars are a perfectly viable (some say sensible) route to car ownership in Singapore.\\u00a0 Not only can you get a vehicle that's in good working condition, you can also avoid the dreaded depreciation, which is most pronounced during the first or first two years of the vehicle's lifespan.\\u00a0 And all that at a fraction of the price too! Another reason to buy second-hand: It allows you to get the car you want at a discount, which means you might be able to afford a pre-owned version of that high-end sports car you've been lusting after.\\u00a0 You can also think of it as taking over a vehicle that has been 'battle-tested' by the previous owner, with all the kinks worked out.\\u00a0 While it's an attractive concept (especially given the sky-high car prices in Singapore), buying second-hand cars isn't completely without its pitfalls. Here's what you need to know about buying a second-hand car in Singapore.\\u00a0\\u00a0 What to look out for when buying a second-hand car How old is the car? COEs in Singapore last 10 years, so the vast majority of pre-owned cars are somewhere in that age range. When choosing a used car, you'll want to go with the Goldilocks option \\u2013 not too new, and not too old either. [[nid:500047]] Newer used cars (in the one- to two-year-old range) tend to command a higher price, as their owners will try to bank on the fact that they're still 'new', and that the vehicle is still in perfect working condition.\\u00a0 Cars that are approaching the end of their COE period, on the other hand, (i.e., seven years or older) will have prices that are more reflective of their lifespan, which you may find more palatable. However, depending on the car's mileage and usage history, you could find yourself facing an unexpected issue, and having to spend extra money to get it fixed.\\u00a0 Hence, as a general rule, cars that are sitting in the three to seven years old bracket are generally favoured by second-hand drivers.\\u00a0 What's the mileage of the car?\\u00a0 If the age of the car speaks to its outer aesthetics, then the mileage is all about its condition under the hood.\\u00a0 Mileage tells you how many kilometres the car has been driven, which gives you an idea of the wear and tear suffered by its engine and internal components. This metric, coupled with the maintenance and servicing history (see next point), will help you decide if the asking price is worth it.\\u00a0 The car's mileage is just as important as its registration date (some would say even more so). Afterall, a five-year-old car that spends most of its time sitting pretty in the owner's garage is likely to be in better condition than a three-year-old one that has covered every single road and expressway in Singapore multiple times over. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Tips to get the best price when selling your car to used car dealers! What's the servicing history? Car manufacturers have a recommended schedule for servicing their vehicles, which may be based on mileage or time elapsed. (For example, it's good to change your engine oil every 10,000 km or twice a year).\\u00a0 Hence, when considering a used car, it's good to check on its servicing history, based on its age and mileage. If the frequency of the servicing deviates too far, it could be a cause for concern. Also, pay attention to the maintenance and service reports for the vehicle. If you see a repeated pattern of fixes for a particular issue, there's a chance you might have to confront the same problem somewhere down the road. (Or, you know, go on a gremlin-hunting mission.) What are the accident records (if any)?\\u00a0\\u00a0 The seller may understandably be reluctant to share such information with you, but it's important to know if the vehicle you're considering for purchase had been in an accident before. Knowing the full facts can help you avoid purchasing a problematic car.\\u00a0 If you find the owner or dealer being less than forthcoming, try checking insurance records for a fuller picture.\\u00a0 ALSO READ:\\u00a0https://www.asiaone.com/lifestyle/used-car-buying-guide-singapore-where-buy-and-what-check What do the warning lights say? Another often overlooked source to check is the car's dashboard panel.\\u00a0 Such panels are designed to provide status updates to important car components at a glance, so you might be tempted to give it just the quick once-over.\\u00a0 However, doing so may cause you to miss noticing any missing or blinking lights \\u2013 which could be a clue telling you there's something about the car you need to pay attention to.\\u00a0 5 popular used car brands and models in Singapore Brand and model Engine capacity\\u00a0 Selling price* Depreciation (per year) Honda Fit 1.3L A 1.3 L $47,000 (approx. three years old)\\u00a0 $6,746 Volkswagen Scirocco GP 1.4 TSI 1.4 L $56,000 (approx. six years old $11,084 Honda Civic 1.6A VTI 1.6 L $66,880 (approx. five years old) $10,860 Nissan X-trail 2.0 CVT 4WD 2.0 L $72,800 (approx. 4.5 years old) $11,338\\u00a0 Mercedes Benz SLK 200 Kompressor A 1.8 L $76,000 (approx. two years old) $9,413 1. Honda Fit 1.3L A A sporty hatchback known for its compact size and nimble handling, the Honda Fit is a popular choice among many Singaporean families.\\u00a0 This is surely due to its generous storage capacity belying its small form, which can be further enhanced by its multiple seating configurations. A great choice whether you're looking to pack your buddies in for a road trip or to ferry a multi-generational household around. 2. Volkswagen Scirocco GP 1.4 TSI\\u00a0 The Volkswagen Scirocco GP 1.4 TSI features a supercharged engine, 7-speed gearbox and smooth power delivery, befitting its status as a budget-friendly racer.\\u00a0 This updated model also has the stylings to fit its sporty ambitions, with gauges that sit in individual binnacles, and auxiliary meters for boost pressure, elapsed time and oil temperature that is sure to get the Fast and Furious crew breathing heavy. Adding to the sleekness are the redesigned air-con vents, which now sit flush with the dashboard. Tasteful use of metal applique adds a dynamic flourish to complete the look. If you've been wanting to get behind the wheels of a sports racer, but can't quite bear to pay full price, this second-hand model should make for a satisfying compromise. 3. Honda Civic 1.6A VTI Another popular car among Singaporean drivers is the Honda Civic, which has long captured imaginations for being a mid-sized sedan with power to spare. The 1.6A VTI variant however wins fans for another reason: it's built more for sensible driving rather than full-throttle action, but in return, rewards with great fuel economy somewhere in the range of 15km per litre.\\u00a0 A fun family vehicle that offers fuel efficiency underneath that trademark Civic look. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Why I bought a car in Singapore: What every first-time car buyer should know 4. Nissan X-trail 2.0 CVT 4WD The Nissan X-trail is a well-rounded SUV with plenty of storage and seating, equally comfortable prowling the city streets, or exploring wild terrain.\\u00a0\\u00a0 It has an optional third-row, which means it can seat up to seven people comfortably and safely, or transport large amounts of cargo. Meanwhile, its four-wheel-drive capabilities offer smoothness, power and control even in off-road conditions. An SUV made for those who work in the city but are prone to impromptu road trips once the weekend approaches.\\u00a0\\u00a0 5. Mercedes Benz SLK 200 Kompressor A As noted in the opening of this article, one of the biggest reasons to buy a second-hand car is the chance to drive a model that would otherwise be out of your price range.\\u00a0 If you've always wanted a top-tier luxury vehicle, why not consider a pre-owned Mercedes Benz SLK 200 Kompressor A? The vehicle's trademark exaggerated bonnet evokes jet-fighter vibes, which is a fitting motif for the top-of-the-world feeling you'll get when you drive off with a pre-owned model at a fraction of the original selling price. Whichever model you go for, if you're ready to take the plunge on a second-hand car, be sure to keep yourself and your car protected with a reliable car insurance plan.

      "      \"summary\": \"With a career spanning over two decades, Belinda Lee has captured the hearts of many Singaporeans with her work as a host and actress. Her most notable works are infotainment shows such as Find Me a Singaporean and Renovaid where she wasn't afraid to get herself dirty to uncover stories of people around the world, especially those who are in less fortunate circumstances. Beyond her professional life, Belinda spreads positivity on social media, and is a champion for social and humanitarian causes, further fuelling her likeability. In celebration of her 44th birthday on July 8, here are 10 lessons we can learn from Belinda on love and life. 1. Don't give up on love [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B4LzYe5g0lE/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] If you didn't know, Belinda got hitched on October 27, 2019, to American architect David Moore. Prior to her marriage, Belinda was engaged for six years before the relationship concluded in 2011. Faced with such a predicament, Belinda revealed in a 2019 interview with Jade Seah that she was disheartened to find love and even swore off marriage and dating. Still staying hopeful, however, Belinda eventually met David at church camp. They got married a year later. On the relationship with David, Belinda said that 'all the waiting for my soulmate was worth it. It is never too late to discover love.' 2. Love sees no boundaries [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B4q8cJVAI20/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Being with someone over a decade older than you can lead to people talking and making unnecessary comments on the relationship \\u2013 and Belinda has bore the brunt of such judgments. This was revealed in a 2021 interview with Phyllis Quek, who coincidentally also a married Caucasian man with the same name and is over a decade older than her. Both stressed that the age and nationality differences were never factors that affected their relationships, and that chemistry was paramount. Belinda added that David was 'one of the biggest blessings in her life'. In a separate interview, David credited Belinda as the one who helped him heal from his late wife's passing. 3. Live life on your own terms [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CCTJKGcAFpi/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] In this day and age, unfortunately, there are still pressures for women to get married and have kids. Judgments are often cast on those who don't conform. Belinda isn't excused from such pressures and judgments too. On the issue of having children now that she's married, Belinda's answer is simple: 'If a baby comes along, you know, I'm very open to the idea of anything, so it's fine as well for us. There are also lots of other children out there in the world who need love and care, and we are also open to the idea of caring for other children.' 4. You don't have to overshare your relationship [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Y2XEyAgOJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] It sometimes seems as though everyone is posting everything about their lives on social media and you may feel pressured to do the same. Being a public personality, the same pressure felt by Belinda could be many times stronger. The couple, however, has chosen to keep their relationship low-profile, adding that 'we felt that we could really have a very wonderful and healthy, honest relationship, just like everyone else, without having the public speculate about it.' 5. Give back whenever you can [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B3RMhz1AZur/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Fronting shows such as Find Me A Singaporean and Renovaid, Belinda has cultivated an on-screen reputation as being a humanitarian. Did you know that off-screen, Belinda was named a Goodwill Ambassador of World Vision Singapore? On this nod, Belinda stated that the nod reflected her wish 'to give back and to speak out for the voiceless'. Her compassion extends beyond humans too. Her late dog Man Man was adopted from a pet shelter where Belinda later nursed her back to health. Man Man, unfortunately, succumbed to cancer weeks before Belinda's wedding. She was slated to be the ring bearer and the wedding venue was even chosen as it was pet-friendly. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Life 401: Quan Yi Fong shares 4 enlightening words of wisdom 6. Radiate positivity as much as you can [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CQpnkEDrX1J/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Belinda published a book titled Larger Than Life: Celebrating The Human Spirit that delved into the touching stories and inspiring people she has met while filming Find Me A Singaporean. She later shared in 2015 to The New Paper that one of the reasons for publishing the book was that 'there are enough negative reports in this world now. I think people need to hear positive, uplifting stories that will restore their faith in humanity.' In fact, scroll through Belinda's Instagram and you'll find her sharing uplifting messages, quotes and captions to her followers. This post, for example, is accompanied with the caption: 'Sending you positive thoughts and vibes to kickstart start your week right! Stay happy, peaceful, healthy and kind always!\\ud83e\\udde1' 7. Find meaning in what you do [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BhZH-lpl_U5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Prior to joining Mediacorp in 2002, Belinda was the first MTV Asia VJ from Singapore. During that stint where she rubbed shoulders and interviewed major stars such as Andy Lau and Aaron Kwok, Belinda professed that 'I could interview the biggest star and come home feeling empty because I felt like that wasn't enough. I didn't find any meaning in it.' She later realised that the party girl lifestyle that she was leading, while seemingly glamorous on the outside, was not giving her meaning and purpose in life, and left her in a constant search of discovering who she is. This brings us to the next point\\u2026 8. Step out of your comfort zone [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CNhJvl7AOnf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Later, Belinda joined Mediacorp and was with them till her departure in 2016. In the introduction of Larger Than Life, Belinda shared that while her career with Mediacorp was initially 'exciting and new', she felt 'sad and a little empty' as she wasn't fulfilling her deeper purpose. She added in the interview with Phyllis Quek that she reached a point in her life where she gained self-awareness on what worked and made her happy, and what did not. As such, she decided to leave, despite some protests, to 'find a happier self' while gaining control of what projects she could work on. Belinda concluded that she is very happy with the decision to leave her comfort zone. In short, Belinda stresses the importance of finding happiness and meaning in what you do, even if it means leaving your comfort zone to seek it out. 9. Appreciate what you have [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BudwPpogT4U/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Living in Singapore, we tend to travel to places with similar conditions for comfort and familiarity, with cities such as Tokyo and Taipei being popular choices. Belinda, on the other hand, has travelled the world, going into areas such as slums and rural villages where she met with people of different backgrounds living in a wide range of conditions. In a 2017 interview with The New Paper where she recounted various cherished travel memories, Belinda imparted this nugget of wisdom: 'Be open-minded and stop complaining, because once you step out of Singapore, everywhere will smell, look and feel differently.' Belinda encourages people to 'go off the beaten track', to enjoy what the world has to offer, free of judgments, and have fun. 10. Your self-worth is not dependent on your job title [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CMOkDfIgDLD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] In a competitive, meritocratic society like Singapore, we can easily be caught up in comparing and competing for careers, income and status levels with our peers. Belinda, however, believes the contrary that your job title shouldn't matter. She shared that her travels 'taught me that whether you are a cleaner, a teacher or a caretaker, it's not about how much you earn, it's about how much value there is in your job.'

      "      \"summary\": \"The Democrats have a problem:\\u00a0They have run away from their core voters.\\u00a0And they are beginning to notice and worry. Lefty blogger Kevin Drum noted this recently. He observes that Republicans have moved slightly to the right, but Democrats have moved way, way to the left on social issues.\\nDrum says he is 'personally happy' about the Democrats' move left. But he is worried, because while the Democratic Party has moved hard left, the voters it relies on to attain power haven't.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nThus, in the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump \\u2014 despite being called a white supremacist and a Hispanic-hater by all the mainstream media \\u2014 picked up black and Hispanic votes.\\nOne reason for this is that racial polarization went down, but 'education polarization' went up.\\u00a0The Democrats are increasingly the party of the college- and graduate-school-educated white gentry class. The Republicans are increasingly the party of the working class, which includes a lot of . . . blacks and Hispanics.\\nJust look at the issues the Democrats are pushing:\\u00a0defunding the police, which hurts mostly poor and working-class neighborhoods; critical race theory, which mostly interests woke white activists (and rich-and-guilty Dem donors) but which actually sends a message of inferiority to minority youths; gender ideology, which plays less well among the more traditional and more religious working-class minorities; environmental policies that produce higher gas prices and lower employment, while pushing food prices up; open borders that drive down wages for downscale workers;\\u00a0and so on.\\nDonors and activists love this stuff. They live in neighborhoods that are mostly insulated from urban crime and disorder.\\u00a0Their kids will still be privileged, regardless of what theories on race are popular. Transgender issues make them feel hip and cutting-edge. Higher gas and food prices won't affect them.\\u00a0And illegal immigration makes sure they don't have to pay too much for a nannies and gardeners.\\nFor a long time, the Democrats were able to have it both ways, pretending solidarity with the working class while promoting policies that undercut it.\\u00a0But they have overdone things, and now people have noticed.\\nThe voting shift of 2020, they fear, was just the beginning.\\nAn example is the recent Democratic Party primary in New York City, where Eric Adams triumphed over more radical opponents. In most cities Adams would be a lefty himself, but these days, simply opposing crime and disorder is enough to get you tarred as a 'conservative.'\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nAdams lost in Manhattan, the wealthiest and whitest borough in New York. He won in all the others. His support came from the working class.\\u00a0As journalist Michael Tracey tweeted, 'It's so funny that an alliance of the New York Post, ethnic whites and outer-borough blacks was the winning formula for the New York City mayoral race.'\\nOr as Adams himself put it: 'This wasn't simply a campaign, it was a five-borough movement of working-class New Yorkers coming together for a safer, stronger, healthier city.'\\nA safer, stronger, healthier city \\u2014 and for that matter, a safer, stronger and healthier America \\u2014 is what most voters want. It's just not what the Democrats' activist core wants.\\u00a0Otherwise, the Democrats would be supporting policies that would produce that result.\\nThings like controlling street crime, homelessness, public defecation and drug use, etc. used to be no-brainers for politicians. How many voters, after all, are in favor of those things?\\nBut in Mayor Bill De Blasio's New York, and in the Democrats' version of America generally, those things aren't priorities. Heck, they're not really even goals.\\nVoters are pushing back, in the Big Apple and across the country.\\u00a0Democrats are on the defensive, going so far as to try to deny that they supported things like defunding the police, or teaching critical race theory in schools. But voters aren't that dumb.\\nIf the GOP is smart \\u2014 I know, a big if \\u2014 it will run on these issues.\\u00a0Give the voters what they want: An idea so crazy, it just might work.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Italian fashion house Fendi used soft colours and marbleised patterns for its haute couture collection on Thursday, presenting a line of luxurious gowns and outfits. Designer Kim Jones said he looked to late Italian film director Pier Paolo Pasolini's depictions of Rome, where Fendi is based, for inspiration. He presented the line digitally with a film by Italian director Luca Guadagnino. Models including Kate Moss and her daughter Lila Grace wore embroidered dresses, satin gowns in marbleised prints, embellished jackets and mosaic-like designs. Netflix expands deal with 'Bridgerton' producer Shonda Rhimes \\\"Pasolini observed Rome become modern - and that is what is interesting to me: connecting eras, the old with the new, the past with the present,\\\" Jones said in a statement. \\\"Rome is a fascinating city because it has so many pasts.\\\"The British designer stuck to a mainly neutral colour palette, showing plenty of white, cream and shades of brown for his second couture collection at Fendi, which is known for its fur designs. Models also wore strapless see-through gowns with embroidered florals, ruffled frocks, short lace dresses, printed coats and trouser suits adorned with acorn depictions. One voluminous dress in soft grey was adorned in floating feathers, while other evening looks included sparkly sequined creations. Jones, also at the helm of menswear at French fashion house Dior, is artistic director for womenswear and couture at Fendi, part of luxury conglomerate LVMH. Red Notice: Netflix announces release date of its biggest movie ever featuring Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot He works alongside the founding family's scion Silvia Venturini Fendi, who looks after menswear and accessories. While haute couture week has seen the return of in-person shows as lockdown restrictions ease in France, some brands, like Fendi, have opted for digital presentations.\",\n",

Six am to 10 am is \\u2018Kapha' time and the energy is ruled by the elements of water and earth and hence we want to bring in the opposite qualities to create balance,' said Vara.\\nShe listed down the six principles in her post on Instagram.\\n Eliminatehttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png\\nBowels, bladder, and anywhere else toxins have accumulated overnight (ears, nose, mouth).\\nTongue scraping\\nGently scraping the tongue helps clean it.

Initial feedback from the industry has been very good and we expect a large in-water line-up of boats and an exciting collection of marine products and luxury lifestyle in the marina-side exhibition hall,' said David Hayes, CEO of organisers JAND Events.\\n\\nVisitors will be able to see the latest launches from the world's most iconic boat brands. Yachts of all sizes, both power and sail, will be on display in-the-water ranging from dinghies and day trippers up to superyachts. Onshore visitors will be able to purchase the latest boating tech, marine products, gadgets and widgets, while also enjoying luxury properties, autos and lifestyle brands on display in the 2,500sqm air-conditioned exhibition hall, the town square and other areas within Royal Phuket Marina.\\n\\nBrought into the JAND team as the Boat Show Consultant, Grenville Fordham \\u2013 co-founder of PIMEX, Thailand's first boat show, and himself a former Phuket boat show exhibitor \\u2013 said, 'After 20+ years working in different aspects of the region's yachting industry, it's an exciting time to be back in the boat show business. And working with a professional event organiser like JAND Events, I know next January's show is going to be the first of its kind \\u2013 and the best yet.'\\n\\nThailand's status as the marine leisure hub of Asia remains undiminished despite the challenges of the pandemic. Famed for its islands, stunning offshore seascape and tropical beaches, Thailand is the favoured destination for boat owners in the region and a popular choice for marine leisure tourists from all around the world. An industry valued in the billions pre pandemic, the Thailand International Boat Show will kickstart its revival and be a valuable economic driver for Phuket and Thailand going forward.\\n\\nBilled as A Luxury Lifestyle Event, the Thailand International Boat Show will be held at the SHA Plus+ certified Royal Phuket Marina. 'I believe this will be the most successful boat show yet. Not only are JAND Events professional event organisers, but they have gone to market much earlier than others have in the past,' commented Gulu Lalvani, Chairman of Royal Phuket Marina.\\n\\n'This will be the first boat show in Asia in two years and there is a lot of pent up demand for boats. Globally, boat brands are reporting record sales and as Phuket is the home of boating in Asia, I expect to see all the international boat brands and more displaying at the Thailand International Boat Show in January 2022,' Mr Lalvani said.\\n\\nA bustling Boardwalk with restaurants and bars, and an extensive social programme is also planned by organisers JAND Events.\\n\\n'To complement the in-water and onshore displays, we will be curating an exciting programme of social events for visitors to enjoy during the day and into the evening. From launches and parties to waterside entertainment, the Thailand International Boat Show will be an event not to be missed,' added Mr Hayes.\\n\\nThe Thailand International Boat Show will take place at Royal Phuket Marina on Jan 6-9, 2022.

      "      \"summary\": \"A large number of people struggle with migraines at some point in their lives. Migraines typically involve moderate or severe pain, usually on one side of the head. If you're looking for easy ways to treat migraines, specific lifestyle changes can help ease the pain or prevent headaches, even before they start. Your lifestyle has a deep connection with your health. With lifestyle changes, you can prevent or at least ease frequent headaches.\\nSleeping routine: Follow a healthy sleeping routine. About eight hours of sleep is necessary to restore the brain. Sleep helps keep your immune system strong, relieves anxiety and depression. Lack of sleep not only increases your risk of migraine, but also puts you at risk of many other health ailments.\\nRegular meals: If you are a frequent diet skipper, then you should not do this even while following a weight loss regime. Skipping meals and fasting both induce migraines. Staying hungry for a long time can cause headaches. Fasting deprives the body of essential nutrients.\\nMeditation: Stress can be a major reason behind your regular migraines. To prevent it, practice yoga, meditation and deep breathing, as it can relieve your stress and help in preventing migraines.\\nNo alcohol and no smoking: Alcohol is a migraine trigger in some people. Similarly, smoking also induces migraines in some. Excessive consumption of alcohol and smoking can affect your body from the inside, making it weak. It can also increase headaches and other symptoms.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Not too long ago, a Singapore-based company released a card game specifically centering on the food culture of Singapore called Hawker Wars. And before that, they have also produced the well-received The Singaporean Dream that focuses on the aspects that most Singaporeans face. Now, it seems like another card game is set to join the Singapore-themed shelf of tabletop games. Launching on Kickstarter on July 10, the new addition is created by The NSXperience, a group of friends who have come together to bring the experiences of Singapore's National Service Basic Military Training to the table (literally). Named Chao Recruit!, it incorporates the culture, lingo and stereotypes of the two-year service that recruits have undergone. The team's rationale behind this card game creation is to produce a bonding experience on the topic of National Service between Singaporean family and friends, regardless of whether they have served or not. In the box, players will receive 65 Action Cards, 8 Character Cards, 32 Experience (XP) Cards, 21 Kena Cards and the Rule Book itself. The objective is to complete three sets of cards that total 5XP, either by using XP cards that range from 1 to 4 XP, or Kena Cards, which brings -3 to -5 XP. As long as the combinations end up with 5XP, the collection is considered a complete set. At the start of the game, each player is given an identity card with its own talent that they can use to their advantage when it's their turn. Five cards will also be given randomly to each participant which can be used during their respective rounds. On each player's turn, they are given three actions to make: play an action card and use your ability, place an XP Card or Kena Card in your own XP zone, or move an XP or Kena Card across different sets in your own zone. Do take note that only a maximum of three different sets can be made in your XP Zone. Here is a more detailed explanation of the gameplay for Chao Recruit!: The whole game is pretty straightforward, especially for those who are already familiar with Monopoly Deal, which was the source of inspiration behind this project. Seeing that the game is catered specifically to the Singaporean audience, the team ensured that the game is entirely manufactured within the little red dot, from its design to its packaging. If you'd like to support Chao Recruit!, do check out their Kickstarter once it starts on July\\u00a010.\\u00a0Additionally, you can also check out their official website as well as Instagram for more information about the card game.

      "      \"summary\": \"\\u00a9 Provided by Lifestyle Asia \\n\\nPost-pandemic tourism will soon become a reality, thanks to the establishment of travel corridors. Also known as travel bubbles or corona corridors, these entail the opening of travel borders between neighbouring countries that allow their citizens to travel on certain routes to and from places with low COVID-19 infections and avoid mandatory isolation or quarantine period. Many countries have opened travel corridors to other countries via exclusive partnerships and seen considerable success in re-establishing connections with each other while combating COVID-19 within their borders. The travel corridors are seen as a way for economic recovery across various sectors. While many countries have released a list of destinations that are open to travel, most of them will require proof of vaccination or coronavirus test results upon entry. Here's a look at some countries that have opened travel corridors to selected nations, and their entry requirements. European Union (EU) EU has published a list of epidemiologically safe third countries that have a low rate of infection and people from these countries can enter the Schengen area from 18 June 2021. (Note that the safe list is reviewed periodically and is subject to change amidst changing infection rates and emerging variants) You can view the updated list here. The EU commission has opened travel from outside of the European Union and is easing restrictions for non-essential travel as well. Visitors will, however, require proof of vaccination. The EU is also set to launch the Digital Green Pass which to restore travel within Europe. The digital pass is free of cost and will be officially implemented from 1 July 2021. The latest list of third countries exempted from the entry ban for non-essential travel since 18 June 2021 includes Albania, Australia, Chinese regions of Hong Kong and Macao, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, New Zealand, Republic of North Macedonia, Rwanda, Serbia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States of America.

      "      \"summary\": \"If you have a baby on the way, then it's time to make sure that your home holds up against his or her growth spurts and curious mind. Expert share that you should child-proof your house a few months before your due date, since you'll likely have your hands full once you bring your baby home. Child-proofing your home is not an easy feat \\u2014 between costs and latching every cabinet with a lock, it's important not to cut corners so that you can ensure the utmost protection for your child in your home. To help you get a head start on creating a safer space for your baby, we discuss 7 easy ways you can babyproof your home. 1. Baby proof your baby bed As your baby becomes more comfortable with their legs, they'll begin to test boundaries like climbing over their crib rails. Since they can start as early as 15 to 18 months , it's important to ensure that the crib's railing is height appropriate for their age so they can't easily climb over it. When buying a crib, you can look at adjustable types which allow you to customise the railing placement. While you can expect to pay an average price of $192 for a baby crib, some of the big-brand cribs can cost as high as $1,666 . Another thing to keep an eye on as your baby gets older is your over-head baby mobile, which might actually cause more harm than good. Once your baby learns to stand, your baby mobile becomes more of a choking hazard than a sleep aid. With this in mind, make sure to remove any small toys or decorations from the nursery when you notice your baby growing into their legs. 2. Lock and secure windows and doors As a parent, it's natural to worry about your child's safety when it comes to the outside world. However, even places like your living room or bathroom could cause harm to your child if not properly secured. By child-proofing doors, cabinets, and windows, you can cross off many potential harms like drowning or poisoning from your list of worries. As your baby begins to walk, they'll become curious about more areas of the house and learn to turn knobs and open doors at will. With this in mind, you should baby-proof the door knobs of bathrooms and laundry rooms to ensure your baby doesn't get access to any tubs, detergents or buckets of water. A door knob cover can lock a door knob in place with a child safety feature, so that your baby can't open a door without your help. A pack of two to three\\u00a0covers costs approximately $9.14 from shops like Qoo10 and Baby Gates Safety. Similarly, you can use child-proof latches to secure your kitchen cabinets and other doors in your home. A two to three\\u00a0pack of cabinet locks is priced at an average cost of $11.85 . With this security, you can ensure that your baby doesn't get into areas that hold toxic cleaning supplies or other types of hazardous products. Lastly, you'll want to secure your windows with child-proof latches so that your baby can't open it, with the risk of falling out. This is especially true if you are on higher floors in your building. A pack of one to\\u00a0two\\u00a0window latches runs at about $4.64 , which will go a long way in ensuring that your baby stays safe in your home. 3. Anchor heavy items in your house Before your baby comes home, you'll want to take stock of all the heavy items in your house, like a lamp, TV, or dresser. These everyday furniture items pose a new risk, especially once your baby begins to walk and open drawers or reach for items in high places. To prevent a major accident, you can anchor heavy items in your house to the wall or the surface it's sitting on. One to two packs of furniture straps go for about\\u00a0$11.96 online from retailers. With these straps, you can secure a dresser in your baby nursery to the wall, so that it has no chance of falling onto your baby. Similarly, you can use a metal wall anchor or strap to fix your TV to the wall. If you have an item like a vase that can't be anchored, then it might be a good idea to find a new place for it while your baby is in its learning stage. ALSO READ:\\u00a04 costs to consider for a home renovation as a parent 4. Watch out for electricity Another rule of child-proofing your home is to keep electronics and electrical outlets out of reach from your baby. This means you'll need to organise your wires, keep vases with water away from electrical applications, and most importantly, cover your outlets. To avoid electrocution, you should use outlet covers to create a barrier between your curious baby and an electric socket. You can buy a two to four\\u00a0pack of socket covers for about $4.23 from e-commerce sites. 5. Gate off areas for baby safe spaces A gate can help you child-proof your home in a few ways. First, a tension-mounted gate can be propped up at the top and bottom of your staircase to prevent your baby from accidentally falling down. These gates go for an average cost of $117.53 , but you can find some simple gates as low as $17.90 from websites like Qoo10. Second, you can use adjustable gates to create a safe space for your baby where they can play, crawl, or sleep while you take some time to complete other tasks. These play yards run 83 per cent higher than your average tension or wall-mounted gate at around $215 . However, your final cost will come down to material of the gates to size of the play area that you wish to wall off for your baby.

Cover sharp corners and hard edges When it comes to baby-proofing, something as small as your table corners is important to cover. To prevent any head injuries, you should soften the sharp corner and hard edges of furniture in your home, starting with your tables. Thankfully, there is a surplus of corner guards and edge tape for purchase. With corner guards, you can blunt any hit on your baby's head when they are learning the ins and out of your home. A one to four\\u00a0\\u00a0pack of corner guards goes for about $13.46 , though it's important to ensure measurements fit your intended furniture before buying. Similarly, edge tape made of a foam material can help soften a blow if your baby were to accidentally hit their head against a side table. You can buy a roll of furniture tape for about $14.79 online. Consult with multiple baby safety guides There are many ways to baby-proof your home outside of this list and it's important to note that you should double down on your child-proofing tactics as your baby gets bigger. We recommend that you do your due diligence far in advance so that you are ready to welcome your baby into a safe environment. Here's some final tips that you can keep in mind when child-proofing your home. Switch out window looped cords with claw or wand cords to prevent accidental asphyxiation. You can also buy safety cord wraps for your window's cords, which keeps them out of harm's way of your child. Test small objects in the house with a toilet paper tube \\u2014 if the item can fit, then your baby can choke on it. If the item fails this test, make sure to keep it out of spaces that your baby will be in. Be careful with tablecloths on your table. Your baby could pull them, which would result in all the tabletop contents falling over, potentially hurting your child. Even with a baby-proof home, accidents can happen anywhere, at any time. As your baby gets older, they will test the world outside of your comfort zone, which may lead to bumps, bruises, or more. With this in mind, you could consider a personal accident insurance plan to protect your child against accidents or poisoning. With the right plan, you can rest your anxieties knowing that your baby is covered, whether they meet an accident outside or within your home.

      "      \"summary\": \"More from us: mbcn.com.ph Much like an open-air museum, Rome is a city that is teaming with history. While technology continues to reign the world today, its beautiful ruins, age-old coliseums, and awe-inspiring sculptures remind everyone of the world's ancient charm, earning it the title of the Eternal City. That is what Fendi celebrates with its latest fashion presentation. The Italian luxury house pays homage to the city by merging its old and new sensibilities in its autumn-winter 2021 couture collection. Led by English fashion designer Kim Jones, the collection showcased men's and women's pieces featuring mosaic designs, tailored suits, romantic silhouettes, and a celebration of texture and sheen thanks to delicate embroideries, recycled fur, and mother-of-pearl embellishments. \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n To present Kim's sophomore couture collection, the fashion house created a runway setup that is true to Rome's majestic landscape and architecture, which makes a perfect backdrop for its fashion film. The stylish featurette is shot by Luca Guadagnino, the 'Call Me By Your Name' director, and is inspired by Pasolini's neorealism cinema, making it a true poetic visual experience. 'Rome is a fascinating city because it has so many pasts\\u2014and I was drawn to Pasolini because I have always been inspired by his vision of the world,' says Kim. 'He is something of an outsider in Roman history, but one whose voice remains constant. I have long admired Luca's work\\u2014and he is someone who, like Pasolini, touches on subjects which are relevant to now.'

      "      \"summary\": \"Baking soda has been touted by numerous guides as the number one cleaning agent to have at home. I'll admit, I've always been sceptical of its cleaning prowess \\u2014 \\u2018huh. Isn't that powdery fluff only an occasional necessity in baked goods?' But what do I know? So I've decided to put those claims to the test, cleaning everything from bathroom grout to the kitchen sink. Here are the results. Claim 1: Removes stains on bathroom taps Method : Sprinkle baking soda on tap. Use a wet sponge to scrub away stains. Results : Success! Although the really stubborn stains needed a bit more elbow grease. Claim 2: Removes coffee and tea stains in mugs Method : Make paste with equal parts of baking soda and water. Use sponge to scrub. Results : Complete success! No more having to reach out for a magic sponge the next time I want to remove these stains. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Laundry hacks you should know Claim 3: Deodorises smelly kitchen sponges Method : Soak smelly sponge in a solution of 4 tbsp baking soda + 1-litre water for two hours. Results : Didn't work. My sponge still smells like last night's pasta. BUT it did look cleaner. Claim 4: Brightens tile grout Method : Make a paste out of 1 part water and 3 parts baking soda. Apply it onto grout. Leave to rest for 10 mins. Then rinse. Results : This did brighten my grout somewhat, although I think you will need to do a little bit of scrubbing to remove the stubborn stains. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Useful hacks using salt to keep your home clean during the coronavirus outbreak Claim 5: Deodorises fridge Method : Place baking soda in a small bowl and leave it in the fridge. Results : I could definitely smell the difference. My refrigerator usually reeks of whatever raw meat I place in there, but just a couple of hours after placing the bowl of baking soda in there, there was zero smell. Incredible. Claim 6: Freshens up white towels Method : Place \\u00bc cup of baking soda in a pail of water. Soak towel in pail overnight. Then wash in normal load. Results : Stains on my white towel faded just a twinge, but it still didn't look as a good as new. ALSO READ:\\u00a046 home hacks that will make our lives easier Claim 7: Cleans kitchen sink Method : Sprinkle baking soda on a half of a lemon and use it to clean stainless steel sinks. Results : A sparkling clean sink that smells great! Although it was difficult to get to the edges of my sink with the half lemon during cleaning. Claim 8: Remove burnt marks on stainless steel pot Method : Make a baking soda paste and scrub on the burnt marks. Results : Burnt marks didn't dodge, despite extra elbow grease. ALSO READ:\\u00a010 useful household hacks for everyone Claim 9: Toilet bowl cleaner Method : Sprinkle about a cup of baking soda onto the sides of the toilet bowl and wash it off with about two cups of white vinegar. Leave it for approximately 15 mins and then scour the toilet bowl with a toilet brush. Results : My toilet bowl has never been cleaner. Bonus: The baking soda reacted with the white vinegar to produce a fun, fizzy chemical reaction (see video). Claim 10: Removes smell on silicone spatula Method : Soak spatula in equal parts baking soda and water overnight. Results : Didn't remove smell.\\u00a0 So turns out, baking soda does have a ton of cleaning abilities! While not all the purported cleaning hacks worked, most actually did. I'll definitely be keeping a box of baking soda on hand the next time I'm doing housekeeping. This article was first published in Renonation.sg.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"HONG KONG (AFP) - With their heads in the clouds and their hands in the soil, a group of office workers are busy harvesting the fruits of their labour on the roof of a Hong Kong skyscraper.\\nInvisible to those below, a sprawling garden of radishes, carrots and rhubarb is flourishing at the top of the 150m tall Bank of America tower, a stark and colourful contrast to the monotone shades of concrete, steel and glass of the city's financial district.\\nThe farm is among more than 60 that have sprouted across the space-starved city since 2015 - on decommissioned helipads, shopping mall rooftops and public terraces - thanks to initiatives such as Rooftop Republic, a local social enterprise which promotes urban farming. Cofounder Andrew Tsui sees the rooftop farms as a way for people to reconnect with how sustainable food can be produced in what he calls the current \\\"instant-noodle city lifestyle\\\" that sees so much waste.\\n\\\"What we are looking at is really how to identify underutilised spaces among the city and mobilise the citizens, the people, to learn about food,\\\" the 43-year-old told Agence France-Presse during a blustery site inspection of the skyscraper's garden.\\nMr Tsui believes that Hong Kongers need to re-establish a relationship with what they eat that has been broken \\\"since we started outsourcing our food and relying so much on industrialised production\\\". According to government statistics, Hong Kong throws out some 3,500 tonnes of food waste a day - the equivalent weight of 250 double-decker buses. Less than a quarter is recycled.\\nAnd around 90 per cent of the food eaten by the city's 7.5 million residents is imported, mostly from mainland China.\\nBut while Hong Kong is one of the most densely packed places on earth, there is still considerable space to grow food locally.\\nMr Tsui said some seven million square metres of farmable area is currently cultivated. But more than six million square metres on the city's rooftops remain unused. \\\"So we could have the potential of doubling the supply of land for growing food,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"The challenge for us is to design urban farming as a lifestyle to integrate into our daily life,\\\" he added. \\\"And the first step for that, of course, is to be accessible.\\\"\\nTo incorporate urban farms into the blueprints for office buildings, Rooftop Republic closely collaborates with architects, developers and property managers.\\nMajor companies are signing up.\\n\\nRooftop Republic urban farmers harvest vegetables grown on a farm at the top of the Bank of America tower in Hong Kong on April 9, 2021. PHOTO: AFP\\n\\nAs well as the Bank of America garden, financed by property consultancy giant JLL, Singaporean banking giant DBS has partnered with Rooftop Republic to set up an academy that runs workshops for beginners as well as professional courses.\\n\\\"In Hong Kong, most of the people focus on the commercial value of the properties. But we want to promote the concept of sustainability,\\\" said Mr Eric Lau, the group's senior director of property management.\\nUrban farmers say the projects also help build community spirit among those who cultivate the crops. After retiring from the public service, Ms Lai Yee-man said she turned to farming to connect with nature and her neighbours.\\nThe 60-year-old initially learnt techniques and tricks from professionals to develop her farming plot in the New Territories region of Hong Kong - a rural area close to the border with mainland China.\\nBut now she is passing on her knowledge to fellow residents working the Sky Garden, a 1,200 sq m facility on top of a mall.\\n\\nAt the Sky Garden, residents grow edible flowers and fruit trees and can attend lifestyle classes such as mindful gardening. PHOTO: AFP\\n\\nThere, residents grow edible flowers and fruit trees and can attend lifestyle classes such as mindful gardening.\\n\\\"People attach greater importance to their health now, they will buy organic food,\\\" said Ms Lai.\\n\\\"Here, we teach them not to waste...and to cherish their food,\\\" she explained, adding that the majority of what the mall farm grows goes to local food banks.\\nMr Tsui recognises that few young Hong Kongers currently have an interest in learning how to grow food.\\nBut younger people are often concerned about the environment and climate change, so the opportunity to generate enthusiasm is there for the taking.\\n\\\"If coding is the skill set to learn for the 21st century, growing your own food is a necessary new skill that we all need to learn to ensure a regenerative and green planet,\\\" he said.\",\n",

Sushruthi KrishnaBut, in 2016, Sushruthi entered the Femina Miss India contest where she was adjudged the first runner-up, and that win changed her trajectory in life.'This opened me up to a world of fashion and also gave me a deeper understanding of the influencer community and their strength in driving commerce. I became interested in influencer/celebrity-led brands, and I felt that there is a lot of scopes for them to be built differently in India. That's when my journey in building D2C brands started, and I have stuck to it since then,' Sushruthi tells HerStory.Her affinity for design led her to the brand-building space, where Sushruthi found a great synergy between her love for design and the ability to build a scalable business around it.\\u00a0Celebrity-led brand Samantha AkkineniSushruthi started Merch in April 2020 to build multiple direct-to-consumer brands in fashion, lifestyle, and other emerging categories.She explains, 'Ethnic wear and fusion wear is a massive market with close to 85,000-90,000 crore turnover, coming from both organised and unorganised markets. Despite that, we don't see a lot of brands operating directly to consumers online. We want to take advantage of this gap, coupled with a celebrity angle for tapping into wider regional distribution networks that aren't buying online. We believe it is a massive opportunity to unfold.'\\u00a0Merch's first brand Saaki \\u2014 launched in September 2020 \\u2014 is a celebrity-led fashion and lifestyle brand in association with actor Samantha Akkineni.\\u00a0While ideating the brand, she reached out to Samantha with a pitch via a common connection.'She really liked the idea, and we met to explore how we could build this together. We aligned on the design sensibility and brand voice; she liked the vision I had for building this as a landmark brand. We found a lot of synergies and she jumped on board,' Sushruthi says.Samantha is the Co-founder and Chief Style Editor of Saaki.From wearing Saaki outfits at home, during her travels, and even shoots, the brand has become an integral part of Samantha's lifestyle.\\u00a0'She also tries on every single sample before it goes into production. She is involved right from the ideation of designs to the shoots and to marketing the products very closely. The team works closely to incorporate her thought process into what we are building on all levels,' Sushruthi adds.Sushruthi works with a 14-member team out of Saaki's office and studio in Bengaluru.The clothes designed by the designers are produced by an exclusive manufacturer in the city. The brand has also tied up with factories across India, which develops the designs.Led by a social media community Samantha Akkineni in SaakiThe brand offers different kinds of apparel \\u2014 sarees, kurtas, sets, dresses, tops and tunics, bottom wear, and accessories, available at prices starting from less than Rs 1,000.While its customers are largely from India from across Tier I, II, and III cities, it is also seeing a lot of demand from overseas. It ships products to 15+ countries across the world, including the US, the UK, and Australia.\\u00a0Saaki has raised angel funding from prominent investors.\\u00a0'We have grown steadily and aim to turn EBITDA-positive in the next three to four months. We are looking to grow 2-3X in revenue in FY22 and are well on track to achieve the same. We intend to grow into a Rs 200 crore brand in a four-year window,' she says.Sushruthi believes the key to Saaki's success has been a strong digital community of women on social media who play a pivotal role in making brand decisions.\\u00a0'Everything \\u2014 from picking brand colours to finalising our logo to what kind of styles we make \\u2014 is strongly led by our social media community, who constantly help us in ensuring we bring out the right products for them,' she adds.At present, the brand is focused on offering only apparel wear. However, Saaki intends to expand and move into offering a complete wardrobe solution \\u2014 accessories, skincare products, and a few other emerging categories.Having come from a family of independent women, Sushruthi says she didn't have to face many challenges in her entrepreneurship journey.\\u00a0'Even though we have come a long way, we still have miles to go before we have an equal representation of women entrepreneurs in the business world. Don't let anyone tell you what you are capable of. You are your own master, and as long as you have an unwavering belief in your ability and calibre, nothing should stop you,' concludes Sushruthi.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"MEADVILLE, Pa. (PRWEB) July 09, 2021 'A Philadelphia Christian in Beelzebub's Court': a faith-based call to worship. 'A Philadelphia Christian in Beelzebub's Court' is the creation of published author S. C. Cundiff, a loving husband and father who founded LivingStones Fellowship in Lewiston, Idaho. He is currently the Senior Pastor of Bethel Community Church in Bethel, Oregon. Cundiff shares, 'This book is a treatise for God, who is deserving of a family of holy people. It is for God, who commands a holy lifestyle from those for whom His Son died and rose again. This book clearly explains how most Christians have been taught erroneous things regarding a holy lifestyle over a period of the last seventy-five to one hundred years. By comparing the charges Christ gave to the seven churches or church ages, in the book of Revelation, we see positive and negative blueprints for the types of Christians living today. Christ gave this direct revelation to the apostle John with the intention that the comparison should strike the hearts of believers and allow them to see that there are positive church types living then and today (Smyrna and Philadelphia) and negative church types living then and today (Ephesus and Laodicea). If any of today's believers in the latter group are sadly justifying their lives, they need to know that there is still time to change.' Published by Christian Faith Publishing, S. C. Cundiff's new book is an engaging discussion of modern Christianity. The author presents a powerful argument for considerations in church reform with respect to biblical teachings.

But how did she do it? Well, Sheila\\u00a0shared her secret with her followers and it is a practical tip that will come in handy for parents who often struggle to convert their picky eaters into healthy chompers.\\u00a0 Sheila Sim's nine-month-old now loves broccoli! The actress shared the cute video on Instagram where her daughter is seen holding on to a broccoli and then chomping on it like a champ. She clearly needs no help and the little one knows what she's doing and loving it too! But this wasn't always the case with Layla. In another video a few months ago, she couldn't even stand the smell of the vegetable. Her head could\\u00a0be seen wobbling as she attempted\\u00a0to bring the broccoli close to her mouth, but she immediately recoiled because of its smell.\\u00a0 [[nid:533573]] So how did Sheila\\u00a0successfully convert Layla into a broccoli lover? Well, the answer is simple: patience and persistence.\\u00a0 Sim continued to feed Layla the greens, even though she rejected it initially. This led the little one to give it a few more shots before she developed a liking for it. Well done, mama! This time tested technique truly is the backbone of getting children to become healthy eaters. But broccoli in particular can be a tricky one to get used to. Which is why you must explain its many benefits to your little one and also try the other techniques we list below.\\u00a0 6 broccoli benefits for baby You can introduce broccoli as soon as your baby is ready to start solids. This is generally around six months of age. Broccoli, as you may know, is a nutritional powerhouse and a one-stop shop for vitamins and minerals that your baby needs. It is rich in vitamins A, C, K, B6 and folate and comes loaded with iron and zinc, as well.\\u00a0 Here's why your baby needs broccoli It is rich in calcium and aids in the growth and development of your baby's bones and teeth. It has vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant and helps to boost your developing your child's immune system. They are high in Omega 3. They help babies with inflammation and allergic reactions. Broccolis are rich in protein and iron that aid in the treatment of anaemia in infants. The vitamin K in broccoli will help in developing the child's memory. The fibre present in broccoli will help avoid constipation and will facilitate good bowel movement.\\u00a0 ALSO READ:\\u00a0Woman shares a clever viral hack that stops her kids from eating junk How to make your kids love new food If you're finding it hard to get your children to eat not only broccoli but other vegetables, a new scientific study may have the answer. As part of the study,\\u00a0researchers\\u00a0doubled the amount of corn and broccoli on children's plates served at a meal,\\u00a0from 60 to 120 grams. The results were astonishing. Experts found that kids ate 68 per cent more vegetables on their plate, which is around 21 grams extra. But, they have also highlighted one potential problem with doubling the vegetable portions, which is it may increase wastage if they don't eat it.\\u00a0 Sometimes we try to season the vegetables thinking that it may appease our kid's taste buds. But, the study highlighted that seasoning the veggies with butter and salt does not affect the children's consumption rates. \\u00a0 So try the following tricks to feed your babies greens, specifically broccoli. Keep serving a new food multiple times It is important for your kids to understand the taste of the food. So you may need to serve a new food multiple times before they learn to accept it. It is okay if they reject them. But be persistent till they actually dig into it. If your child rejects the taste of a new food like broccoli for the first time, you shouldn't stop serving the food to them. Sociologist Dina Rose says that kids need to taste a new food somewhere between 10 and 15 times before they'll finally accept it. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Nutrition for kids: Which vitamins are essential for children? Invite them to taste the food Dr Rose recommends that instead of asking your kids \\\"Did you like the food that you tasted?\\\" invite them to taste the food and share their views. You can ask questions like, \\\"How is the texture of the food?\\\" \\\"Is it crunchy or smooth?\\\" \\\"How does the food look?\\\" You will find that the more your kids get accustomed to tasting different foods, they less fear they'll have in their minds. Only when kids manage to eliminate this fear, will they let go of their inhibition of trying out new foods.\\u00a0 3 delicious broccoli recipes you\\u00a0can prepare for your baby Lemony Broccoli Ingredients Broccoli (1 head) Lemon Olive oil Butter Steps Cut florets away from the stalk.

You can add some salt to the boiling water so that it gets into the pasta. Cool it until the pasta is soft Then steam the broccoli and finely chop them Drain the pasta and then add it to the broccoli. Mix the egg yolk and the butter as well at this stage.\\u00a0 You can add milk, cheese and mustard. Keep stirring until the cream melts. Add the broccoli, salt and pepper and mix the pasta well. Note: In order to minimise the risk of choking, chop the broccoli into small pieces. Steam the florets until they are soft and then slice each floret in half lengthwise along the stalk. Remember that steaming helps to retain the nutrients of the broccoli as compared to boiling. You can also roast the broccoli, but for younger babies, steaming is usually the safest option. When your baby becomes an advanced eater (12 - 24 months), you can decrease the amount of time you are steaming.\\u00a0 So try these recipes and follow Sheila's\\u00a0secret: persistence and patience to convert your picky eater into a healthy one.\\u00a0 This article was first published in theAsianparent.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"The stakeholders could do more to secure the future of our children\\nThe concerns expressed by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) over growing attacks on schoolchildren, as well as child abductions in Nigeria, should be taken seriously by the authorities. No fewer than 950 students have been abducted in the country since last December, according to a statement by UNICEF Executive Director, Ms. Henrietta Fore. About 500 of these children were abducted within the past six weeks. 'It is not enough to condemn these crimes, not when millions of children face a worsening protection crisis,' said Fore. 'Children living in these areas need concerted action to ensure that they can safely live and go to school or fetch water without fear of being attacked or taken from their families.'\\nWe agree with UNICEF on the urgent need to tackle this growing pattern of roving genocidal gangs who target schools and homes to abduct innocent children. We challenge the federal government and the authorities in many of the states concerned to do a little more than the usual display of incompetence and blame game that have deepened our insecurity. Indeed, repeated attacks on schools in recent years have created fear in many vulnerable students and their parents, especially in some sections of the country and is affecting the attitude to education. The implication of this unfortunate state of affair is damaging and enduring. Dozens of students and five teachers were recently abducted from Federal Government College, Yauri, Kebbi State in a third of such mass kidnappings within a month. They reportedly killed one of the police officers on duty, broke through the gate and went straight to the students' classes. Meanwhile, the number of students abducted from Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna State in the early hours of Monday have been put at 121 with their captors threatening that the students would starve to death if their parents do not supply foodstuff before negotiations could begin on payment of ransom.\\nHowever, while we urge the authorities to move quickly to ensure the safe return of all our children that are in captivity, including in Niger State, payment of ransom and doing deals with criminals cannot be a sustainable approach to handling a challenge that borders on law and order. When a school is under attack and students become targets, according to Manuel Fotaine, West Africa Regional Director of UNICEF, 'not only are their lives shattered, the future of the nation is stolen.'\\nWhen gunmen enter school premises almost at will to cart away children, government must understand that it is dealing with a serious problem. From Federal Government College, Buni Yadi where no fewer than 58 male students were brutally assassinated to Government Secondary School, Chibok where more than 100 girls are yet to be accounted for seven years after to Government Girls' Science and Technical College (GGSTC), Dapchi where Lear Sharibu remains in captivity on account of her faith three years after her colleagues were released, these criminals not only target the most vulnerable of our citizens, there is also a calculated attempt to further polarise the country.\\nSince we cannot afford to leave our children at the mercy of criminal gangs who are bent on truncating their future, there is an urgent need to go back to the drawing board on how to keep the schools safe. As Fore argued, 'every effort must be made to reverse the spiralling protection crisis for children' who have now become sitting targets for criminal cartels. When parents can no longer send their children or wards to school without the fear that they could be abducted, the future of our country is in jeopardy.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"In her new column for The Drum, Ally Owen catches up with individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to understand how she can become a better ally. Emmanuella Owusu-Ansah is her latest guest.In this series, you'll get to meet a talent who will share their individual story so we can gain a deeper understanding of their experience and the interventions that will make us a better ally to them.Today, my latest guest is Emmanuella Owusu-Ansah, currently a programmatic activation executive at Manning Gottlieb OMD.Emmanuella shares her challenging journey into the industry and mixed experiences, from turning her Zoom camera off due to the discomfort of being the only Black face in a sea of white to feeling valued and respected.It's key that we remember it's a privilege to be able to educate yourself around racism and learn from another's experience, rather than experiencing it yourself.Ally: So Emmanuella, thank you for taking the time to speak to me about your experiences. Can you tell us a little bit about your journey into the industry?Emmanuella: My journey into the advertising industry brought a lot of frustration, to be honest. I felt like no matter how hard I tried, doors were always being closed. I invested my time and energy going to interviews, and was promised feedback that I never got.It often felt like employees were lacking in the decency to tell me what I could do better, and it meant I couldn't learn from the mistakes I was making \\u2013 and that everyone makes when they're starting out. Everyone's hiring system is different so it's hard, and each person hiring has their own perception of what they want, regardless of what is written in the job description.You did have some older friends in the industry already, which is a rare bonus \\u2013 what did they do?One was a creative, and another worked in CRM. They would both help coach me so I'd get interviews. And I did get interviews but I didn't get the roles. And as the time passed, I needed money \\u2013 I live in London!Also, while I was a front desk receptionist, I met an executive creator director and we still talk today. He gave me loads of encouragement and tips. He allowed me to sit in meetings and give ideas on briefs. It was so refreshing! He believed in me and saw potential in me. It helped me believe in myself a bit more, after all the rejections. I'm interested to know if you have ever had an occasion where you were taken advantage of, despite having a sense of the industry already through these relationships?Yes! I once worked for an entertainment company and got to know the marketing manager there. A small festival couldn't afford their services so she suggested they speak to me at reception. I jumped at the chance.I was told I would be paid to work on their social media in my spare time. I naively thought I would get paid, and didn't understand I should have had a contract. However, after discussing my ideas with them and starting to create posts for them I found out they already had a social media agency on retainer. After the festival, I asked for payment continuously but I was ignored. I wasn't paid a penny.It's so important that the industry does more to protect those seeking experience and internships from financial abuse. I really admire how you took control of a terrible situation. So how did you come to finally enter the industry?I knew I wanted to get into advertising, but I didn't know how. I did the 2020 Change \\u2018I AM CHANGE' program. And there was an induction for BFS and there I realized, the \\u2018how' turned out to be BFS. I knew I loved advertising and how stories can relate to different types of people and there wasn't enough representation. I wanted to be part of the change, whether that was on screen or in the industry behind the images we see. When you see someone like you on screen it's so important. You see someone like yourself and don't feel invisible. It made a difference for me and I wanted to help others see themselves too.Then Covid-19 hit and being put on furlough allowed me to do BFS. I then did an internship and started working at Manning Gottlieb OMD, and I am now in the position where I am able to recommend talent to them. This has resulted in two other Black girls who were my contacts getting into programmatic!When you entered the world of programmatic, did you see an immediate need to improve diversity at all and are you a part of that change?I could see MGOMD is diverse as a company, but in what I do specifically, in programmatic, there weren't many Black or Asian people from what I could see. I knew I was in, so I could get girls who look like me in as well. It's the little things I can help do when it comes to diversity.I always thought I would have to be chief executive or director before I could enact change. But the director asked me, and as I set a good example, they trusted me to refer. I gave them seven people all together \\u2013 they asked me about the process and who I thought was best, and they interviewed everyone and picked two. Talking about it now I realise I've minimized it in my mind.You've completely minimized it! Did MG quickly understand your value?Yes they have! And I feel valued and part of them rather than being the \\u2018other'. Hearing friends' experiences, they will say: \\u2018Because I am the only one everyone thinks I speak for all Black people.' But every Black person's personal experience is very different, so no one Black person speaks for all.Do you feel you have to ask for respect that others are automatically given?Yes. When I've been in a senior position, others from a different ethnicity have ignored me unless I've brought someone else in. I often found myself becoming rude or standoffish as I was being demeaned and that was the only tone they would respect.Now I stay calm and don't play into it. Also, I have in the back of my mind that if I don't do well in what I am doing the next Black person might not be given a fair chance because of me. I don't want that. So I'm my sister's/brother's keeper.What a burden and a lot of pressure. Did you ever have an ally in these moments?In the past I had a manager who was Black, and he would do what he could, but he was experiencing the same. He would ignore those that disrespected him if they asked him for something in the office. He had got to the point of \\u2018you have no respect for me ever, so I do not need to speak to you'.From my knowledge, many people feel like if they report something to HR that has to do with race, not much will be done. Especially if the disrespectful person was senior. You learn to navigate around these people. Our manager did his best to protect us, he spoke up for us.How has this injustice affected you?It led me, in past internships, to deciding not to turn my camera on so colleagues wouldn't see I was Black on Zoom meetings. Especially when I was in spaces where I was the only Black face. You see your face standing out against a sea of white. You stand out. Post-BLM, it's a sensitive time \\u2013 it's not helpful to be the only one. That's definitely not the case now. I do feel confident in showing who I am, even if I am the only Black person on the call.It must be very painful to be in that situation. What does the industry need to be doing to improve?Ultimately it's about hiring more Black people and other ethnicities, recognizing that there is a problem and checking in to see if people are OK.A colleague once said to me: \\u2018Seeing you has made me think I should employ more Black people into the company.' It shouldn't have taken seeing me in a sea of white to realize what a problem they had. But then I realized that a lot of people don't put energy into things that don't affect them. If it was the other way round...It's also about having a proper plan in place and not running with the excuse that the company is busy. But it's about the people at the top. If they aren't fixated on change then it won't happen. Companies are there to make money, but you need to make sure the people who make you that money are OK. As well as it being right to treat all employees with equal respect, a contented workforce is much more productive than a distressed one. It's good business. If I want to get the best out of you at work, I need to make you happier.What has your experience been like at MG?It's been great so far! I'm happy there. The thing that gave me so much reassurance was that when I put on my LinkedIn that I got a job there, a number of Black people from other companies reached out to me and said it was a good place. That made me feel much more confident.I think it's important for the industry to realize our networks do talk about companies and we don't signpost talent to places where we know they won't thrive. Do they not realize we can choose too? It would be stupid to think we don't talk. I've been told to avoid places and have a list of places where I know there aren't safe spaces at this point in time. People seem comfortable with being part of the majority and I have to deal with being part of the minority.Have you seen a slowdown of changemaking post George Floyd?Yes, definitely \\u2013 a huge slowdown. Though there are still companies and programs like BFS and 2020 Change that are actively making a choice to try.Those in power should reach out/respond to those who are reaching out without power. Lean into one Linkedin message request, and leverage that power to help someone else who doesn't have the same start as you.Finally, do you have any resource recommendations for people to explore to help them be a better ally?The Trusted Black Girl: Challenging Perceptions and Maximizing the Potential of Black Women in the UK Workplace is a book I recommend you read to understand the experience of Black women in the UK workplace. There are also a number of really great podcasts as well, such as Black Women Working, Adulting 101 and To My Sisters \\u2013 give them a listen!Ally Owen is an industry changemaker and founder of Brixton Finishing School.If you would like to share your entry-level experiences with Ally and provide further insight into the industry's practices, please fill out this confidential questionnaire.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Friday, 9 July 2021 00:04 - \\u00a0 \\u00a0 - {{hitsCtrl.values.hits}} The pandemic may have brought about many negatives for the Government, whether it be managing the economy or the countries creaking healthcare system, but one \\u2018positive' has been the cover it has seemingly provided for them to pass legislation away from the public gaze.\\nEarlier this year, it was the Port City Commission Bill which scarcely provided room for debate, and the latest is the Kotelawala University Bill, which has many stakeholders up in arms.\\nThe Bill proposes to allow the existing General Sir John Kotelawala National Defence University (KNDU), which at present trains primarily defence personnel, to award degrees, charge fees and invest the profits in any business considered suitable by the university's administration, as well as being able to admit students and partner with other private and foreign institutions.\\nControversially, the Bill also places the management of the university under the Defence Ministry, with a senior officer of the armed forces as the university's head or vice-chancellor, not under the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, as is the norm.\\u00a0\\nThis is the point which many have taken umbrage to, with the latest protest this week resulting in several arrests, including that of Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) student protestors and Ceylon Teachers Union Secretary Joseph Stalin. That the arrests have been conducted under the pretext of the protesters violating pandemic-related guidelines on large gatherings, is problematic in and of itself, but is discussion for another day.\\nRather, it is important that we take a closer look at the grievances these protesters have against the KNDU Bill, namely, that it could lead to militarisation of higher education in Sri Lanka. This is indeed something even the JVP has brought up in the past, stating that 'the proposed management and regulatory structure for the KNDU proposed in this Bill relies primarily on military personnel and offers minimum space for external accountability and overview'.\\nThat said, the fact remains that changes are undoubtedly required in Sri Lanka's higher education system \\u2013 especially when it comes to Universities.\\nOnly about 17% of students who qualify for university entrance actually gain admission to a State university in Sri Lanka, leaving hundreds of thousands of promising youths behind. State universities' inability to absorb all deserving students has resulted in an inequitable situation where students are forced to either resit the Advanced Level examination or seek alternate means of tertiary education or find employment via some form of vocational training.\\u00a0 Successive governments have attempted to find a balance between public and private universities but have found little success.\\nSri Lanka should seriously consider following a system such as that found in Australia where universities are graded for transparency and local students are given prominence, but the system is so effective and efficient there are plenty of foreign applicants as well and the universities attract highly qualified teachers and administrators.\\u00a0\\nWithout such a transparent and independent regulatory system and investment mechanism, higher education in Sri Lanka is at risk of being sold to the highest bidder \\u2013 or in the case of the KNDU Bill, the potential militarisation could pave the way for rapid militarisation, commercialisation and a decline of quality, standards and fundamental goals and objectives of university education in the country.\\nThis is especially problematic as education will be a key decider of the living standards of future generations and the growth trajectory of the entire country. Saddled with an aging population, Sri Lanka needs to make the most of its human resources.\\u00a0\\nHopefully the Government can find a way to negotiate a better return for everyone keeping in focus the capacity to achieve universal social mobility as the ultimate indicator of the success of a university education.\",\n",

As a former educator I find it appalling we would not want our students to be exposed to a more balanced set of facts. Not opinions, facts.

The author of the introduction, Nikole Hannah-Jones, won a Pulitzer. I haven't heard anyone ask to replace current history curricula with these programs, but to use them as supplements.I went to college in the 1970s never hearing about the Tuskegee syphilis experiments in the 1930s, or about redlining in federal housing policy, or the fact that Black World War II veterans were unable to obtain equal access to the GI bill or VA loans, or about the Tulsa Race Massacre, or how nearly all the toxic industries in our country are located in the parts of cities occupied by mostly black and brown people, or about the thousands of lynchings that occurred between 1880 and 1950, some of which happened in Iowa and Illinois.In the 1990s I was required to take a multicultural course and found it challenged some inaccuracies in my training and made me rethink some assumptions.Don't we want our students to be critical thinkers? Isn't that what education is really all about?\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"There is an educational divide by race in Chicago, as federal data shows wide gaps in advanced placement courses, segregation and discipline between African-American, Latinx and White students. Even in the face of that data, Chicago Public Schools officials say Black and Latinx students have made tremendous academic strides, which has led to educational experts noting CPS as 'one of the fastest-improving districts in the country.' Still, the district said there is much work to be done to address the impacts of centuries of disinvestment in all facets of life that students still feel the impact to this day. Just ask college student Styles Avant-Pinkston. The University of Illinois-Chicago junior said when he was growing up in West Austin, some families made the decision to send their children out of the neighborhood to get a good education. 'If you're not in a good elementary school, you're gonna most likely go to a middle school that's not good and then when it's time to take a test to get into these good schools in Chicago, you haven't been trained for this,' said Avant-Pinkston. Avant-Pinkston is now is studying history and secondary education and said he wants to teach in his childhood neighborhood. 'We need to make sure that these neighborhood schools are being the best, they are the best of the best,' Avant-Pinkston said.\\u00a0'I shouldn't have to take a fifty minute bus ride to go to a good school.\\u00a0 I should be able to just walk to a good school.' Black and Brown students make up the large majority of CPS students, and yet a ProPublica analysis of 2015 federal data shows white students are 2.3 times more likely to be enrolled in at least one advanced course as Black students. 'We're dealing with a hundred years of really intentionally exploitative economic policies towards Black communities and policies that explicitly created a segregated school system,' said Alexios Rosario-Moore, Ph. D of the UIC Department of Education Policy Studies. According to numbers released by the US Department of Education, in 2017, Black students made up just over a third of CPS's student population, but more than three quarters of CPS students who were expelled were black. Chicago Public Schools opened its Office of Equity in 2018 to address educational equality. 'Chicago Public Schools is deeply committed to improving outcomes for all students and closing the opportunity gap between white and students and Black and Latinx students is among our highest priorities,' said CPS spokesperson James Gherardi.\\u00a0 'While the root causes are systemic and it will take time to fully address, the district remains committed to continue doing everything in our power to ensure students in every community have equitable resources and educational opportunities.' CPS said in 2020, students achieved a record-high five-year graduation rate of 82.5%, an accomplishment spearheaded by strong gains from Latinx and African-American students. Additionally, CPS said it has restructured admissions to selective enrollment high schools to ensure access from high performing students in every corner of the city.\\u00a0 The district added disciplinary action continues to improve for the district, including a reduction of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, police notifications and student arrests taking place on school grounds. Still, Rosario-Moore said it is important to examine school policies to make sure disparities can be mitigated. \\\"We're in the single digits for graduating young black men from four year colleges and we know that there's a strong association between four year degree completion and wealth,\\\" said Rosario-Moore. UIC said it's Call Me MISTER (Mentors Instructing Students Toward Effective Role Models) initiative is to increase the pool of available licensed teachers from a broader, more diverse background.\\u00a0UIC said the initiative supports undergraduate students who want to teach and serve as role models in urban elementary schools to positively impact the lives of children.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"By Tanushree SenThe Cooke Town community donated towards the education of three little girls, an initiative spearheaded by two Good Samaritans of the neighbourhood It all began when Deepti Nair moved to Cooke Town in April this year. She would go for walks and was often accompanied by three little Nepali-origin girls, and she befriended them and started talking to them. That's when she understood that the girls were missing out on their education due to financial constraints, and so, with the help of her neighbour, Pamela Parashar, an animal activist, they decided to pitch in and do something for them.\\n 'I had just moved in here in April and Geeta Didi (their mother) used to work at my home. The three little girls would often accompany me for walks when I would go out with my pet. After talking to them, I realised that they were not going to school because of financial constraints,' says Nair. According to Nair and Parashar, their father -- who also works as a security guard in the nearby buildings \\u2013 had been unable to provide the school fees for more than a year, and so, the kids could not attend their sessions. The fees had a backlog of a year. 'It didn't help that the father had a mentality where he thought that the girls did not need an education,' adds Nair. 'The Marie Niketan School principal told us that they had called the parents several times to come to the school, but there was not much of an effort.'\\n And so, the two women decided to do something. Nair posted on social media last week, asking for donations to fulfill the pending fees of Rs 1 lakh. And the response was overwhelming, she says.\\nDeepti Nair Within one day, donations had come in \\u2013 some from the Cooke Town community and some from the nearby neighbours and some from Nair's and they got more than what they wanted. One lakh, 10 thousand was the collected amount and after paying the fees, the women bought books and items for the little girls, studying in the fifth, third, and first grade respectively.\\n 'The girls are super smart and disciplined, and if you meet them and speak to them, you will know what I mean. They are very enthusiastic and already have their goals set in mind,' adds Parashar. 'I'm really glad that we did this and the community also did their best.'\\nPamela\\nHowever, while the girls' fees have been paid for now, they will again have to pay the fees the net year. The women hope that some initiative is started which will take care of their education in the long run. \\nIf you wish to donate or help these three little girls, you can write to nair.deepti15@gmail.com.Are you an East Bengaluru resident?

      "      \"excerpt\": \"5G has a lot to offer in education. How can the integration of 5G networks into education delivery revolutionize the global education community and transform teaching and learning?\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"Source: Background vector created by Starline | www.freepik.com.This post is the first of a two-part series on 5G systems.\\u00a0 Imagine a world with no wires or cables, where virtual reality is always present and accessible. In the post-COVID-19 era, the educational landscape has sped into digitalization. Most classrooms have adopted some form of virtual learning, requiring video conferencing and other devices, but that has not come without technical difficulties. The lack of access has amplified the technological gap in parts of the world.\\u00a0 However, the integration of 5G networks into education delivery has the potential to revolutionize connectivity issues and streamline classroom logistics while improving the quality of the entire learning experience. 5G will help teachers across all educational levels facilitate an enhanced experience for learners. So, what is 5G, and how can the global education community use its capabilities to transform teaching and learning now and into the future?\\u00a0 What is 5G?\\u00a0 5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology, is the fifth iteration of cellular network operations. It differs from 4G, the most prevalent wireless technology, due to latency \\u2014 the delay between sending and receiving information. With its extremely low latency rate, 5G allows educational delivery to be faster, more reliable, and smoother\\u00a0. For example, when compared to a 4G cell tower, a 5G cell tower can hold and support about 10 times as many devices. This is highly relevant in an educational scenario since lower latency and greater available bandwidth will support superior levels of communication over larger distances.\\u00a0 Take the university campus, for instance. An expanded campus reach can improve accessibility to wireless networks, and some universities have already begun the integration. The University of Miami first brought this technology to its campus, making it easier for students to access classes and engage in academic pursuits. 5G can also improve the quality of video conferencing, add haptic response capabilities, strengthen immersive learning experiences using virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), and allow for the personalization of education. For example, the AR app Froggipedia allows students to study a frog's internal organs without harming any real frogs. It also enables students to visualize the transformation of frogs from tadpoles into their adult form. Another example, in continuing education, is VirtualSpeech, a VR tool that helps individuals work on their public speaking skills in a more effective and realistic manner.\\u00a0 How can 5G transform the global classroom? Let us now look at the five main benefits of 5G for learning: 1.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Improved interaction between teachers and learners and collaboration among peers\\u00a0\\nWhen you log into Zoom, there is a high propensity toward lagging and breaks in connectivity, which negatively impacts educational delivery. With 5G, video conferencing platforms will improve in quality and reliability around the globe. Therefore, instead of waiting for programs to load, time will be better spent connecting teachers with learners, even in remote settings. Teachers will save time by not having to work around delays in connectivity or breaks in audio and video connections and instead focus on the learner. Students will be able to download videos and learning materials faster and even have holograms of guest speakers in their classroom without dips or delays. Also, since 5G allows more data to be transferred, communication among peers for group projects will happen faster and with less lag \\u2014 almost as if people across geographies are sitting in the same room. 2.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Accelerated quality and adoption of immersive learning\\u00a0\\nSome skills, such as lab work and hands-on experiences, require extra tactile stimulation to engender the same level of learning online as in real life and real-time. Those interested in learning new skills and visualizing abstract concepts in an interactive way can benefit from the integration of AR and VR into immersive classrooms. 5G will provide a greater network capacity and seamless experience that allows learners to explore complex concepts through zooming, pinching, and even touching. Further, haptic responses (that reproduce the feeling, touch, or motion of interacting directly with a physical object) could introduce tactile forms of learning to a classroom through traditional video conferencing platforms, making interactions richer.\\u00a0 3.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Personalized learning experiences\\nEducation generally follows a one-size-fits-all approach that many say could hinder growth. 5G has the capability to change that! It will improve personalization by creating intelligent systems to understand the unique needs of each student and create targeted learning journeys. For example, virtual teaching assistants could allow cohorts to access different sets of lessons and assessments depending upon the profile and preferences of learners. This has implications for skilling and upskilling as well as technical and vocational education and training (TVET). 4.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Boosted on-the-go learning\\u00a0\\nAs 5G expands to reach more aspects of daily life, it will make learning on-the-go easier, providing greater responsiveness and speed across all devices, especially mobile. Imagine the increased flexibility given to busy students and professionals who want to (and need to) learn outside the classroom. 5.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Leveled playing field5G will accelerate the promise of democratizing access to quality education in inclusive and affordable ways, thus leveling the playing field, especially for under-resourced communities.\\u00a0 For example, the 5G-enabled Verizon Innovative Learning classroom brings learning to life through immersive worlds. It has the power to change the way all of us learn.\\u00a0 5G clearly has a lot to offer in education. In the next installment of this series, we will examine some of the challenges facing the rollout of the technology for learning and how it might contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 4\\u2014Quality Education.\",\n",

Education guides attitudes, leads to positive activities and help the entire society live cordially with one another. The education sector has been the engine room of all other sectors but of recent, it is suffering setbacks caused by incessant kidnappings carried out by bandits. The first incident of students' mass abduction occurred in 2014 when over 200 students of Government Girls' Secondary School, Chibok were kidnapped by insurgents.From that time, academic activities, especially in secondary schools, are carried out in phobia and uncertainties of where is the next target. Parents in rural areas that were forced to enroll children in schools are using students' abduction as excuse for preventing the kids from going. Increase in students' kidnappings has become a big threat to the future of students.To end kidnappings in its entirety, governments should employ or enroll repentant kidnappers. Discriminating against repentant kidnappers does nothing but pull them back to their ignoble activities. It is necessary for everyone to treat them with love, care and concern. People should live within their means. Excessive lust for money and luxuries often times leads to regrets and it is pertinent to live a contented life. If arrested kidnappers are found guilty, they should be punished according to the provisions of the law irrespective of who they are or who they know.Mukhtar Garba Kobi, 08100358411.YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNEWe Have Not Had Water Supply In Months \\u2015 Abeokuta ResidentsIn spite of the huge investment in the water sector by the government and international organisations, water scarcity has grown to become a perennial nightmare for residents of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.

      "      \"summary\": \"Under a budget proposal currently sitting in the California Legislature, UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego would cap out-of-state or international admissions to no more than 18% in the next three years. The rationale behind this nonresident cap is that seats at UC campuses should be saved for California taxpayers. But a troubling paradox emerges: While capping the number of nonresidents would create 4,500 additional seats for California students, it also would likely decrease the quality of education and opportunity for all UC students, Californians included.\\nA quick fix to inequity in education access is enticing but not realistic. We oppose the nonresident cap.\\nFirst and foremost, the UC system might not be able to afford it. According to Chancellor Carol Christ, the current state allocation for each California student fails to meet the actual cost of instruction, so the UC system relies on the inflated tuition paid by nonresident students. While the budget proposal offers to cover that shortfall, it creates vulnerability to recessions or future budget cuts.\\nIt's also worth noting that nonresident students are not eligible for California or UC financial aid. A decrease in nonresidents might prompt an increase in everyone's tuition, pushing a UC degree further out of reach for lower-income admits. The gap filled by nonresidents benefits all students on campus, whether they grew up in the East Bay or were raised an ocean away.\\nStudent culture benefits from a diverse student body composed of people from all backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses and geographic origins. Instead of feeling pitted against one another based on where they are from, students should be able to celebrate the opportunity to learn with peers from all over the planet.\\nFinally, UC Berkeley is not turning down in-state students at a higher rate than other American public universities. While UC Berkeley historically has accepted more nonresident students than any other UC campus, the most recent available data shows that it still has a nonresident student population that is considerably smaller than the average at other U.S. public schools.\\nThose who support the nonresident cap might correctly recognize the inherent class stratification bred on most college campuses. Admitting more nonresidents inherently favors those who can afford out-of-state or international tuition. Non-Californians who leave their home state to pursue a UC degree often gain access to more opportunities and a higher quality of education than others back home, exacerbating inequality through generational wealth and privilege. But this is the product of a larger, all-encompassing issue of unequal distributions of opportunity and education \\u2014 one that a nonresident cap is unlikely to fix.\\nUltimately, everyone should have the ability to receive a quality education, regardless of geographic origin or socioeconomic status. Creating additional barriers to entry for non-Californians works against that ideal.\\nEditorials represent the majority opinion of the editorial board as written by the summer 2021 opinion editor, Sarah Siegel.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"by Karen Schoen\\nA fact is a piece of information that can be proved with concrete evidence. An opinion is a view or judgment about something and can change often. Education is supposed to immerse the individual in facts so that whenever a decision is needed, the individual can make the most logical, common-sense decision.\\nHistorical Facts: Thousands of white people died in the Civil War trying to end slavery. The voting rights act was passed in 1965. The Great Society Legislation passed in 1964-65, spending millions on urban renewal, medical care, housing, and transportation for rural and inner-city blacks.\\nSensible conclusion: Discrimination/oppression of black people ended a long time ago.\\nWhile a fact refers to something true or real, which is backed by evidence, documentation, etc. Example: the moon's temperature ranges from -298F at night to 224F during the day, which has been determined and confirmed by astronomers, scientists, and lunar landings.\\nOn the other hand, opinion is what a person believes or thinks about something. Example: I think the moon is made of green cheese; it sure looks like it on a cloudy night, don't you agree?\\nFacts make use of the left brain, and by using proper skills, the individual can reason, prioritize, and come to a logical conclusion. Once these skills are realized, the individual can make quick, common-sense decisions. Example: If in multiplication 5 x 3=15, then in division 15 divided by 3=5. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacts are universal and only change when solid, verifiable evidence is found that refutes the fact. Example: For centuries, wise men believed the earth was flat. When explorers returned with evidence there is no end-point, the earth is round, and you can circumnavigate it, the fact was changed.\\nOpinions use the right brain where emotion will guide the decision, often making judgments without basis. Emotion is a learned response to a particular situation. Emotions are abstract and often personal, so they are easily changed.\\nA person can only think of one thought at a time. If only the left brain is developed, then the individual has little time for issues that involve emotional responses, i.e., art, movies. If only the right brain is developed, the individual can not reason, lacks common sense, and will often make decisions based on how things look rather than how they operate.\\nIt's very difficult to understand the relationship between SEL, CRT, and CRT because they are three different approaches to the same thing, Emotionally controlling the people. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCritical Race Theory: CRT is a Theory, a system of rules, procedures, and assumptions used to produce a result. Who's opinion, who's assumption, what if I disagree? Many common tactics in CRT training, including segregating people by race, race-shaming, ascribing certain attributes to people based on race, and ' claims that by virtue of race, a person is inherently racist or inclined to oppress others.' You must assume things to be true.\\nSocial-Emotional Learning: SEL forces the child to see all issues under an emotional lens, often shutting down the right brain to logic and reason. Too often, the child gets so emotionally charged that they become unruly (so involved in their emotion) and no longer have the ability to express themselves. They no longer have the ability to listen to an opposing viewpoint because it doesn't make them 'feel better.' So Johnny, who had a bad feeling from reading about the boy who lost his life getting hit by a train, gets mad at the engineer instead of asking why the boy was on the track to begin with. Emotion overplays logic. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe purpose of school is to disseminate factual information for a person to store in their brain and use at a later time when needed to make informed decisions, i.e., common sense. However, a person thinking through emotion will never have a firm footing. They will constantly be thinking, how do I feel about that? How am I making others feel? Decision-making becomes a horror. Emotion changes constantly. Because Facts rarely change once the individual knows facts, they become more secure in their decisions.\\nA student taught to think of everything in terms of SEL will become an emotional person incapable of having a conversation with an opposing perspective. They lack common sense and don't have the ability to draw conclusions logically. They allow others to make decisions for them rather than risk hurting someone else.\\nJohnny White, Suzie Black, Jose Brown were in class. The teacher asked what 2 plus 2 is. Johnny knows the answer but is afraid to raise his hand because the rest of the students will think he has white privilege. Suzie thinks she knows the answer but won't say anything because what if she is wrong and the others laugh at her and hurt her feelings\\u23e4she will just want to die. Jose knows the answer but won't talk because he will get a passing grade for coming to school. How does this create excellence?\\nAnd the answer is\\u2026IT DOESN'T. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the goal is not excellence, the goal is division. The ruling class of Globalists doesn't want people to come together as Americans. They don't want the populace to think logically or to think factually. They don't want people to communicate because they might have an opposing view. They don't care about the truth because the ends justify the means. They want the populace to be trained to think about how they have designed the world to think emotionally. Emotional people are easier to control \\u2013 no opposition. They want the people to 'stay in their lane.'\\nCulturally\\u00a0Responsive\\u00a0Teaching is a pedagogy that recognizes the importance of including students' cultural references in all aspects of learning. CRT is a fancy term for multiculturalism (dividing people by ethnicity) which means stay in your tribe. No exploring America or American values of being the best you can be, you must be the same as everyone else in your tribe. Instead of students learning the 'new ' ways of American exceptionalism where they can make their own choices, they must choose from what the rulers have offered. Instead of people coming together as Americans, they stay apart based on ethnicity. CRT will constantly divide the population. Culturally Responsive Teaching | Teaching Diverse Learners \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inability to make clear decisions based on facts too often pushes the person into an emotional dilemma. I am stuck, they think. I can't make a decision. I am an emotional mess. Where are my pills? If I give the right answer, will my compatriots think I am a racist? I'll kill myself rather than be called a racist. There is a reason why the suicide rate is climbing.\\nBy eliminating facts, skills, and morality, the person never has a firm footing. Things change all the time. Not being on a secure footing destroys confidence and self-esteem.\\u00a0 This type of training is now filtered throughout all disciplines. ELA, MATH, SS, Science are all seen through an emotional racial lens called diversity, inclusion, reparations, equity, social justice and etc.\\nThey can't eat, sleep. Can't cope? Not to worry, there is a syndrome, psychiatrist, and drug for that. Must be something wrong with you\\u23e4need a sex change?\\nSocial-Emotional Learning (SEL) is the vehicle used to guide CRT into the conversation. By claiming everything in life is dictated by racism CRT, students are inhibited from speaking, expressing their true feelings. Maybe Suzie Black gets the answer wrong because she didn't do her homework, which is nothing to do with race. Johnny White is stuck because he will be called a racist exercising his white privilege if he gives the right answer. Everyone will think I am a racist. So rather than giving the right answer, the student is prompted to think\\u23e4is this answer going to offend someone else? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(OR) The teacher asks the question, who knows what two and two are? Johnny thinks, why bother answering\\u23e4they will just call me a racist. I'll just play with my blocks; besides, if I don't answer anything, I'll pass anyway, and that is safer.\\nRather than answer #4, learning the fact and moving to the next fact, children are now fearful of giving the wrong socially acceptable emotional response that someone they don't know decided they should have. They are inhibited and are learning to keep quiet even when they are right. So if they can't be right when they know they are, they will do something else to get attention \\u2013 drugs, sex, pink hair, body piercing, drinking, etc. Children will do anything to get the attention they lack from being right in school in front of their peers.\\nSEL and CRT are just fancy names for behavior modification. A psychological trick used to elicit the appropriate required response for an action. All the child does is learn the responses approved by the textbook company. If you follow procedure, you will get the correct OUTCOME.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0No innovation, no creation, no competition, no thinking outside the box. Now every child must think inside the box. There is no room for individuality which is its purpose. No wonder why the STEM attendance is so poor. No thought, just stimulus, response, stimulus, response, training for Pavlov's dogs, not people.\\nWe are not graduating individuals. We are graduating clones who, given the right stimulus, will give the right response. No reading, writing, or math is needed. Just respond the way you were taught. White people are bad and the cause of your problems. If you are a minority, you are the victim and can blame someone else for your problems.\\u00a0You can riot without consequences.\\nThere is a reason why Collier Co. Schools are failing and graduating students who are only 34% college-ready. Focusing on emotion, not facts, does not prepare an individual for worldwide competition. Focusing on emotion does not enable a child to learn to read, write and do math which is the purpose of education. Every text regardless of subject contains CRT. Please do not adopt these texts.\\u00a0 We need a real pause to find great texts and curricula for Florida's students.\\nBased on the four domains of the Social Justice Standards (Identity, Diversity, Justice and Action) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9 2021 Karen Schoen \\u2013 All Rights Reserved\\nE-Mail Karen Schoen: [email\\u00a0protected]\\nWebsite: http://www.karenschoen.com\\nThis content is courtesy of, and owned and copyrighted by, https://newswithviews.com and its author.

      "      \"summary\": \"The University of Otago has once again topped the key Government indicators that measure the educational performance of students at New Zealand's universities.Released today by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), the annual Educational Performance Indicators (EPIs) examine course and qualification completion rates, retention rates and progression to higher levels of study.Qualification completion measures the percentage of students who have gone on to complete a full qualification (e.g. a degree) within a specified number of years of commencing their study. Course completion is the pass rate for the component courses/papers that make up a qualification.According to these measures, Otago ranked a clear first for overall student qualification completion, first year retention, and progression. In the other measure, course completion, the university ranked third.Assessing performance over 2020, this being the most recent complete academic year, this excellent result follows Otago topping all four measures in 2019, topping three out of four measures in 2017 and 2018, and earning a clean sweep of all the key indicators in 2016.Otago also ranked first in this latest round for M\\u0101ori in three of the four measures and second in the other. It ranked first for Pacific students in one of four, second in two and third in one.Otago's acting Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic), Professor Pat Cragg, welcomed the strong showing of Otago in the latest indicators.'Supporting our students to achieve to their potential is an enduring point of focus here at Otago, as our ongoing EPI performance aptly demonstrates.'It has been most pleasing to achieve such a strong result for 2020, a year so obviously disrupted by the COVID\\u201119 pandemic. Our latest result is testament to the huge amount of effort and dedication both staff and students put in during a year that was exceptionally challenging.'Otago's showing in the latest TEC performance measures:Course completion rate (91.2 per cent)First-year retention rate (84.3 per cent)Qualification completion rate (73.3 per cent)Student progression rate to higher level study (95.2 per cent)Educational performance indicator reports (TEC website)\",\n",

On Legal Education as Training for Justice and the Rule of Law (Against the \\u2018Dark Sides of Legality') (Netherlands Journal of Legal Philosophy, Volume (50), Issue 1, 2021, pp. 3-12) on SSRN.\\u00a0 Here is the abstract: To quit or stay? To co-operate or to push back? Indeed, lawyers are sometimes faced with these thorny dilemmas. In this editorial essay the author draws on David Luban's recently published 'Complicity or Lesser Evils: A Tale of Two Lawyers' and the comments provided by Leora Bilsky and Natalie Davidson arguing that these difficult dilemmas not only occur in \\u2018illiberal regimes', but they also regularly occur in liberal legal orders. This claim is illustrated by a discussion of the Dutch Childcare Benefit Affair and the troublesome role of lawyers therein. What role do law schools have in developing a professional ethical compass on the part of future lawyers that allows them to deal responsibly with such dilemmas? Shouldn't we in response to large-scale injustice and in addition to the question 'where were the lawyers? not also seriously address the question: \\u2018where were the law schools'? In line with Bilsky and Davidson, the author argues that as part of a realistic legal education more attention should be paid to the \\u2018dark sides of legality'. Recommended!\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"As I sat down to write my annual self-evaluation for the past academic year, it dawned on me that my experience was a shared one: From kindergarten to graduate school, students and teachers all endured the same tragedy and triumph. Here's my take as I wish all of us a safe and successful start to the upcoming school year as we reboot education for 2021-22. Academic year '20-'21 will most likely be recorded as 'The Lost Year.' The COVID-19 pandemic effectively shut down traditional education for an entire academic cycle, an absolutely unprecedented event with consequences that will reverberate for years, possibly decades, across all levels. With in-person instruction impossible, nearly every educator was required to rapidly pivot to online instruction, deploying a dizzying combination of self-authored materials, pre-packaged lessons and the instantly\\u2013ubiquitous Zoom conferences. It was a difficult, heartbreaking and frustrating year for students and teachers. However, despite the tragedy, most of us still gained tremendous experience in teaching online and, perhaps most importantly, in compassionately guiding students who were enduring the same tragedy we were. My opinion remains hopelessly mixed. There were victories: I came to trust Zoom as a communication platform after a very rocky start. I wrote the equivalent of three textbooks worth of curriculum. Students praised the well-organized Blackboard lessons and lauded the fact that all late penalties were waived. I'm not alone in these accomplishments. Most educators work hard to help students succeed. But failures abounded as well. Working from home often proved nearly impossible. I don't have a home office space, so sitting for hours in a living room chair was harmful to me physically. I lost energy, gained weight, and gradually developed repetitive-motion injuries in both elbows. I struggled to put in anything like a full-time schedule. Real-world distractions constantly pulled me away from the less solid reality of online teaching. The 'virtual' versions of meetings and professional seminars that usually provided networking opportunities were tedious at best, unbearable at worst, and I began skipping them altogether. This created ongoing professional isolation. I haven't seen most of my colleagues in 18 months. Students were equally mixed in their successes and failures. Their adaptability amazed me. These kids had to rapidly learn new software and new communication modes while simultaneously coping with a nearly apocalyptic social catastrophe. Yet last year students produced some of the best work I've ever seen. Two of them actually got professionally published. These folks discovered and embraced the benefits of online education, enabling them to balance their busy, stressful lives and still achieve their education goals. For many, attending school online was wildly successful. Yet at the same time, deep sadness and anxiety pervaded. I saw front-line health care workers Zooming during their lunch breaks, masks on, eyes wide in exhaustion as they tried to discuss their writing topics while sick patients waited just outside the break room. Single mothers tried to homeschool while taking class, apologizing constantly for falling behind, incessantly thanking me for not punishing them for being overwhelmed. And I had first-timers, equally terrified of both the virtual world and the real one. Many of these just disappeared. They logged in once or twice, got swamped and sank. So I can't tell if the year was a triumph or a total flop. In some ways, we are completely burned out; in others, it's still Spring Break 2020. We have pressing questions to answer. What did this last year do to us all? Which changes should stay? The goal remains as clear as ever: serve students as well as we can. But how do we make education more compassionate, adaptable, and accessible without letting distractions, trauma, and inexperience wreak havoc? I'd like to think that all will be well as long as we stay focused on that goal. And yet, as August draws near, I sense a growing anxiety: Maybe the system is broken for good. Maybe I've forgotten how to do my job. Most likely, I'll have nightmares in late August. Most likely, I'll be fine by September. Here's hoping that you find your way as well.

      "      \"summary\": \"By Yasmine Regester, Peacemaker Staff Writer / July 8, 2021 Share this article: The Guilford County Board of Education has received threatening emails over the last two weeks, filled with racial slurs and derogatory language.\\nThe messages were sent through the school district's 'Let's Talk' messaging program, which allows the public to send comments directly to district leadership. Some of the emails, which are now public, called the board members, 'single-cat ladies' and called for Guilford County Schools (GCS) Superintendent Dr. Sharon Contreras' termination.\\nOne of the messages was attributed to an email address that included a reference to the Proud Boys, the far-right group whose members have been associated with both the 2017 White supremacist torch-bearing rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack.\\nDr. Sharon ContrerasIt was followed by another email that suggested that Guilford County Schools create a \\u2018Thank You White People Day,' in order to 'celebrate their enormous generosity,' because, 'They allowed millions of poor non-White immigrants (expensive) from all over the world to immigrate to their country and enjoy a high standard of living even though they're going to become a minority in the United States.'\\nOn June 10, during a regular school board meeting, members of Take Back Our Schools-GCS staged a protest outside of the school district offices. Take Back Our Schools-GCS (TB) is a local conservative coalition of parents and community members who have advocated for an increase in school resource officers, protested an appeals process for suspensions and now oppose critical race theory.\\nThe group returned to the board's June 17 meeting where there were reports of yelling through a megaphone during the meeting that took place, as well as banging on the windows. School board members and school staff have expressed that they feel their safety is at risk with the amount of vitriol that has been aimed towards them recently.\\nIn person meetings have been closed to the public for more than a year now due to the pandemic, with all meetings being held virtually. The public is allowed to submit comments online. The meetings are scheduled to reopen to a limited number of the public at its next meeting on July 13, while still following state social distancing guidelines.\\nIn the emails, people also argue against Critical Race Theory (CRT) being taught in schools. However, GCS leadership maintains that CRT is not part of the approved curriculum and is not taught in schools. Guilford County Schools Board of Education chair, Deena Hayes-Greene noted that 'dog-whistle words' are being linked to CRT, such as 'race' or 'white.'\\n'It's unfortunate and troubling that we have local people here under the guise of caring about all children. The agenda around all of it has all been in opposition to everything the superintendent has done, all the way to calling for her termination. The group has engaged school board members to get her fired. It's elicited some very dangerous characters. I don't minimize what this could lead to,' she said adding, 'Our ultimate goal is safety.'\\nDeena Hayes-GreeneDistrict leadership has commented that the emails have been handed over to local law enforcement and the situation is now under investigation.\\nIn response to the emails and recent events, Take Back Our Schools-GCS said they are not behind the emails.\\n'There is a great divide in our country about CRT. The perspectives and definitions of CRT can be seen with two vastly different lenses. TB holds that endorsing or perpetuating racism of any kind is unacceptable. TB has never threatened anyone, ever. Whatever alleged threats that were made to anyone at GCS were not by anyone in this group to our knowledge. If anyone was a part of any kind of threatening, we would remove them from the group immediately as well as report them to authorities. There have been publications that have twisted and manufactured incorrect information about TB to form a narrative. TB is a platform for parents and community supporting strong learning environments and safe schools for all,' the group said in a statement to the Carolina Peacemaker.\\nCritical Race Theory or CRT is an academic concept developed in the 1970s by a group of legal scholars, intended to study how racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice, but also something embedded in legal systems and policies.\\nAcademic experts, such as Dorinda Carter Andrews, professor and chairperson, Department of Teacher Education at Michigan State University's College of Education, assert that critical race theory is not an ideology or a political orientation that assumes White people are bad; it assumes White supremacy is bad in all of its forms. It's a practice or approach that provides language and a lens for examining racism at institutional and structural levels. Underlying this is the premise that racism is endemic to American society and those White supremacist ideals and practices should be dismantled.\\nCritics of CRT assert that the theory leads to negative dynamics, such as a focus on group identity over universal, shared traits; divides people into 'oppressed' and 'oppressor' groups; and urges intolerance.\\nOutside of CRT, Hayes-Greene who is also cofounder and managing director of the Racial Equity Institute LLC, an organization that specializes in racial equity training, says she does not feel that students are learning enough about race in schools.\\n'Brown vs. Board of Education was not about reviewing and transforming our education system to reflect what we say our American values are: equal opportunity, life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. We have never been accurately historical about our history. We have not done a review of our curriculum or education standards so they (students) have never received an accurate history of the United States.'\\nShe also said that over the years, the school board has discussed enhancing the curriculum, but that it is a complex structural issue.\\n'We have tried to integrate reading material and information that is reflective of the diversity of our district and nation and that's been challenging,' said Hayes-Greene. 'And we can't ask teachers, on top of what they are already asked to do and teach in the classroom, to then take a crash course on facts and information that they haven't been exposed to. There needs to be a cross-systems effort that looks at the college level, educational testing services, textbook publishers, schools of education\\u2014so it's just not that simple. But it is long overdue to have that conversation,' said Hayes-Greene.\\nAlthough the emails have been worrisome, Hayes noted that the school board has also received support from the community that spans across racial and socioeconomic lines.\\nAccording to the N.C. Public Instruction, CRT is not taught in any North Carolina schools. But the discussion of CRT being taught in elementary schools has now become a national discussion.\\nOn Tuesday, July 6, Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the second largest teachers' union in the U.S., put her support behind teachers being able to teach 'accurate history' during opening remarks at the union's biennial TEACH professional development conference. She noted that CRT is not taught in public schools and the union has a legal defense fund ready to defend any teachers who are accused of teaching it.\\n'Let's be clear: critical race theory is not taught in elementary schools or high schools. It's a method of examination taught in law school and college that helps analyze whether systemic racism exists,' said Weingarten.\\nShe went on to add, 'Culture warriors are labeling any discussion of race, racism or discrimination as critical race theory, to try to make it toxic. They are bullying teachers and trying to stop us from teaching students accurate history. This harms students. These culture warriors want to deprive students of a robust understanding of our common history. This will put students at a disadvantage in life by knocking a big hole in their understanding of this country and the world.'\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday stressed on adapting higher and technical education to the changing environment and emerging challenges and asked centrally funded technical institutions to reinvent themselves and develop innovative models to meet future needs.Interacting with over 100 heads of institutions via video-conferencing, the PM called for building an ecosystem of technological education in Indian languages and translate global journals into regional languages. Modi described the education sector as a social investment, and asserted that 'access, affordability, equity and quality' should be driving higher education, with focus on the youth, women and those from deprived background.Union minister for education and skill development Dharmendra Pradhan, ministers of state Annpurna Devi, Rajkumar Ranjan Singh and Subhas Sarkar were also present during the interaction.Modi noted that \\u2018Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' will form the basis of dreams and aspirations of India in the coming 25 years when the country celebrates 100 years of Independence and technological and R&D institutions will play a major role in the upcoming decade which, he added, is also being called as 'India's Techade'.He lauded the research and development work done by these institutions towards meeting the challenges posed by Covid-19 and appreciated the efforts of young innovators towards providing quick technological solutions.In a post-interaction tweet, Modi said: 'Had an enriching interaction with directors of leading IITs and @iiscbangalore during which we exchanged thoughts on a wide range of subjects including making India a hub for R&D, innovation and popularising science among the youth.' Modi said the country's higher educational and technical institutions need to prepare the youth for continuous disruptions and changes, keeping in mind the fourth industrial revolution.He underlined the need to progress towards education models that are flexible, seamless, and are able to provide learning opportunities according to the requirements of the learners and appreciated the improvement in the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education in the past few years. Pradhan said India has got a New Education Policy after a period of 34 years and the Indian education system has taken a giant leap in fostering an environment for a futureready 21st century India. During the interaction, Professor Govindan Rangarajan of IISc Bangalore, professor Subhasis Chaudhuri of IIT Bombay , Professor Bhaskar Ramamurthi of IIT Madras and professor Abhay Karandikar of IIT Kanpur gave presentations to the PM and highlighted various ongoing projects, academic work, and new research being done in the country.\",\n",

During his administration, dormitory housing was offered for the first time, enrollment reached a record high of 892, the faculty nearly doubled, and a new library/classroom wing was constructed. Christianson was also very active in community affairs. He was president of the Junior-Senior P.T.A., the Coeur d'Alene Campfire Council, the Coeur d'Alene Wildfire Confederation, and the Coeur d'Alene Kiwanis Club. He also served two years on the Coeur d'Alene City Council followed by three terms as the mayor of Coeur d'Alene.

At present, schools, colleges and universities in Haryana are closed due to the second wave of COVID-19. \\\"As of now, the COVID-19 curve is flattened. Therefore, while ensuring strict adherence of COVID-19, the educational institutions should be reopened at the earliest,\\\" said the chief minister in an official release here. The chief minister presided over a review meeting regarding the implementation of the National Education Policy(NEP) in Haryana here. Khattar said the state is already leading the way to ensure successful implementation of the NEP by 2025. \\\"Since the announcement of NEP, dedicated efforts have already been made by both the state and Central governments for spreading extensive awareness among the teachers, stakeholders, but making each child who is the real beneficiary of this policy aware is the need of the hour,\\\" Mr Khattar said. During the meeting, top officials of four departments -- Women and Child Development, School Education, Higher Education and Technical Education -- apprised the chief minister about the blueprint of the successful implementation of NEP by 2025 as announced by him during the Budget session 2021. The chief minister was apprised that the recommendations of NEP have already been placed in practice in Haryana and even the recommendations made by Haryana have also been included in NEP. He said possibilities of opening one school in each district offering foreign languages should be explored and the number of these schools should be increased according to the demand. He said these schools should be opened with residential facilities. A cluster plan should be made for these schools, the chief minister said. Khattar was apprised that out of the 4,000 play way smart schools, as announced by him, 1,000 are ready to start the admission process as soon as the educational institutions are reopened.

Photograph: ANI Photo. Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi's expansion of the Union council of ministers on Wednesday, July 7, was unlike other ministerial reshuffles he has undertaken since he came into office in May 2014.\\nIn inducting 43 new ministers in his government, Modi has empowered OBCs and SC/STs. 27 of the new ministers come from Other Backward Classes, 12 from the Scheduled Castes and eight are from the Scheduled Tribes.\\nTo find out the impact of Modi's ministerial caste churning, Syed Firdaus Ashraf/Rediff.com spoke to social scientist Badri Narayan whose books Republic of Hindutva -- How Sangh is reshaping Indian Democracy and Fascination Hindutva: Saffron Politics and Dalit Mobilisation are a must read to understand how the Sangh Parivar is reshaping India's caste super-structure.\\nAs a political scientist how do you see this jumbo expansion of the Modi ministry?\\nIf you read my book Republic of Hindutva you will understand exactly what happened in this expansion. This expansion will help the Bharatiya Janata Party expand its social roots. Now they are inclusive in their governance.\\nYou are talking of inclusion, but where are the stalwarts like Arun Jaitley or Sushma Swaraj in the Modi government?\\nWhat is democracy? Democracy is the politics of aspiration. And whichever government rules in a democracy is itself a reflection of democracy.\\nGovernments and ministries will have to reflect that. Till now it was not done because democracy did not progress that way in our country.\\nWe will have leaders from the lower strata in the future and you might not get a leader like Arun Jaitley in our Parliament.\\nWhat you are saying is that the English-speaking elite has made way to others?\\nIndia is a country of such people and only they must get representation. We have illiterate people in our masses and they will have to get representation.\\nBut then there are professors and learned people too in this Cabinet. I am only saying that in the 1960s there were many Congress leaders and ministers who could not even sign their name and they used to be in power.\\nIs this the first time that such a large caste base has been included in the Union council?\\nYes, I think so. This is the first time that such a huge community alliance has been formed and provided space in governance.\\nWhich is a good thing so long as government efficiency is not sacrificed at the altar of social re-engineering.\\nYes, it will be efficient because many times a simple village man is more efficient than people like us.\\nWhy do the English-speaking class feel they are the only ones who are efficient in work?\\nMy own mother was from a village and she was more efficient than me. She used to handle crises better than me.\\nWe will have to come out of our elite perception of governance.\\nDon't you feel Modi has expanded his government keeping only elections in mind and not governance?\\nWhat is democracy? Democracy is only elections and governance. They will run the government in a good way and also benefit in elections due to this Cabinet expansion. What is wrong in it?\\nThe exit of Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar was shocking, they were the face of the government.\\nIn inclusion of social communities or marginal communities, it does not matter who is in and who is out.\\nYou don't need good-looking ministers on television.\\nYou also don't need ministers who speak well on TV. You need ministers who can deliver on governance.\\nLet us wait and see how these newly appointed ministers perform.\\nAs far as Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar are concerned, the BJP must be having some plan for them. They do not do anything just for the sake of doing. The put a lot of thought behind every political move they put in. The BJP is a very well-planned party.\\nIs this exercise akin to Rabri Devi's induction as Bihar chief minister in the mid 1990s?\\nNo minister of the Modi government is like Rabri Devi and secondly, Rabri Devi was not a bad chief minister in terms of governance.\\nThere was lawlessness for sure, but it was more during Laloo Yadav's time vis-a-vis Rabri Devi's rule. Laloo was an BA and MA. In her (Rabri Devi's) time, crime didn't grow in Bihar.\\nHow do you take India to the future when we still go by religion and caste in matters of governance?\\nDid you see any religious person among these ministers? Every minister was looking modern in their outfits, and like family men or women. I didn't see anyone wearing a tilak, except maybe a Telangana minister.\\nThe BJP is like us. They are just like you and me. They wear and eat the same things as we do.\\nMoreover, it is not a guarantee that only educated people can run the government well.\\nGovernance needs a different kind of wisdom. In many democratic countries it was found that not so educated people have ruled very well.\\nAny example you can think of in India?\\nKarpoori Thakur (chief minister of Bihar in 1970-1971 and 1977-1979) was not very well read, but he did well. He was not someone like (Madhavrao) Scindia who studied abroad and came to India. He was a decently educated and ran the state very well, and so did Mulayam Singh Yadav who ran Uttar Pradesh well. He was hardly a BA, I think. He did well in governance.\\n\\nKarpoori Thakur and the power of street politics\\n\\nMulayam Singh did carry out the Yadavisation of UP politics.\\nI know where you are coming from because caste is different and governance is different.\\nIs it true that the Modi government, while not sharing the data on OBC population with their opponents, is using it to their advantage in politics to win elections?\\nIndian society is like that and politics will be played on those terms. We can talk hi-fi things, but on the ground level these things (make you win elections).\\nLike in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been seeking statistics on the OBC population from the Centre which the Modi government is not willing to share.\\nAgreed, this statistics everyone needs.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Tribune News Service New Delhi, July 8 Prime Minister Narendra Modi today interacted with directors of centrally funded technical institutions and stressed on the need to adapt higher and technical education to the changing environment and emerging challenges. Interacting with over 100 heads of institutions via video-conferencing, he advocated a robust and upgraded research and development culture, which will boost the country's campaign for self-reliance. 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan will form the basis of dreams and aspirations of India in the coming 25 years when it celebrates 100 years of Independence,' he said. 'Our technological and R&D institutions will play a major role in the upcoming decade \\u2014 \\u2018India's Techade'', the PM said. He said the desired paradigm change in the country's education matrix would need institutions to reinvent and reevaluate themselves and develop alternative and innovative models. The PM lauded the R&D work done by these institutions towards meeting the challenges posed by Covid. He appreciated the efforts of young innovators towards providing quick technological solutions. 'Our higher educational and technical institutions need to prepare our youth for continuous disruptions and changes, keeping in mind the fourth industrial revolution,' he said. He underlined the need to develop an ecosystem of technological education in Indian languages and translate global journals into regional languages. The Prime Minister noted the improvement in the gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education in the past few years and observed that digitisation of higher education could play a big role in increasing GER. Modi batted for focus on developing futuristic solutions in fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, defence and cyber technologies. He stressed on the imperative of good quality infrastructure in higher educational institutions to ensure that products associated with artificial intelligence, smart wearables, augmented reality systems and digital assistants reach the common man.\",\n",

The Universal Service Fund (USF) under the Ministry of Information Technology awarded a contract Rs154 million to Jazz for providing high-speed mobile broadband services in Multan and Khanewal districts of Southern Punjab. The minister said information communication technologies (ICT) and global connectivity were important to enhance human development, eliminate digital divide and build knowledge societies. Qureshi said promotion of ICT could prove helpful in poverty alleviation by making markets digitally accessible for farmers and improve food security. He said the efficient use of information communication technology was an effective measure to combat the COVID-19 situation by raising awareness campaigns through mobile networks, data collection and analysis, epidemic geo-fencing, and vaccination records. He recalled that during the coronavirus pandemic, the government gave away Rs203 billion to 15 million poor families through digital cash system under the Ehsaas Emergency Programme.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Image: Marvel's Spider-Man (Insomniac)\\n\\n\\nLike many others have, I spent some time \\u2014 maybe too much \\u2014 playing Spider-Man.\\nWhile I thought I'd be taking a break from chemistry research, I found myself web-swinging through virtual research missions all over New York City. I collected samples of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Hell's Kitchen, studied vehicle emissions in Chinatown and determined the chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter in Midtown.\\nSpider-Man has many of these eco-friendly research missions. But what I found most encouraging is that the game also includes tools that can potentially teach advanced concepts in chemistry and physics. These tools include adjusting the wavelength and amplitude of radio waves, rewiring circuits to meet target voltages, and what will be examined here, using absorption spectroscopy to identify unknown chemicals.\\nBeleive it or not, the millions of people playing Spider-Man have been unwittingly introduced to principles of quantum mechanics. There is a lot of veiled science to this aspect of the video game. Perhaps more importantly \\u2013 as a chemistry researcher and university lecturer \\u2013 I believe the game represents an interesting opportunity to teach science in a fun and engaging way in higher education.\\nSpectroscopy and \\u2018Spider-Man'\\nTo better understand the scientific technique that players simulate in 'Spider-Man,' it helps to have a short primer on what absorption spectroscopy is. The interaction of light with matter is the most powerful means scientists have to understand what matter is made of. When matter does not interact with light, we are quite literally left in the dark. This problem is made obvious in the still unknown composition of dark matter that constitutes the vast majority of matter in the universe.\\nUsing light to study ordinary matter like atoms and molecules is a broad field of science known as spectroscopy. It is an important part of university courses in chemistry and physics. There are currently many different types of spectroscopy. However, the underlying concepts are almost entirely the same as the original version that began in the 17th century when Isaac Newton first dispersed sunlight with a prism.\\nAs famously illustrated on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon\\u00a0album cover, dispersing the white light of the sun with a prism reveals its continuous colour spectrum extending from violet (higher energy, shorter wavelength) to red (lower energy, longer wavelength). However, if this is done carefully, you would find that this continuous spectrum is patterned with intermittent dark bands.\\nWhile the origin of these dark bands was not fully understood until the 20th century, scientists now know that they are due to absorption of specific wavelengths of light by atoms and molecules present in the sun. In fact, this kind of spectroscopy led to the discovery of helium in the solar spectrum before it was identified on Earth. This is why it derives its name from the Greek 'helios' meaning sun. So what causes this phenomenon? Atoms and molecules have a set of energy levels that depend on how their electrons are arranged. The absorption of light \\u2013 which remember is energy \\u2013 can cause the electrons to rearrange into these different levels. The catch is that the energy \\u2013 or wavelength \\u2013 of light must exactly match the energy difference between two electron arrangements in an atom or molecule for absorption to occur. This set of energies is unique for each chemical and leads to a distinct absorption spectrum much like a fingerprint from which it can be identified.\\nIn Spider-Man, the player identifies unknown substances using simplified versions of these spectra.\\nThe goal is to match the pattern in the spectrum using the fragment inventory provided to give the absorption spectrum of the unknown substance. Unfortunately for chemists everywhere, determining the chemical structure of an unknown molecule is much more complicated.\\nStill, there is a significant amount of science conveyed in the video game version of what a spectroscopist would call assigning this spectrum. Only slight modifications and additional explanation could make these parts of the game an excellent way to teach these concepts to undergraduate science students. But are video games ever used in higher education?\\nVideo games in higher education Video games for teaching more elementary skills like arithmetic or spelling are common. Similarly, universities are increasingly infusing video games into their coursework.\\nIn a recent publication in the journal Nature Chemistry, researchers presented a modified version of Minecraft\\u00a0called 'PolyCraft World.' In this game, the player learns polymer chemistry by crafting materials in the game. Preliminary results showed that students learned real chemistry through the game even though they weren't doing it for grades or getting regular classroom instruction.\\nIn the popular game Kerbal Space Program, the player builds their own space program by successfully launching rockets into orbit. The game was not originally intended for educational purposes but implements rigorous orbital mechanics in its physics calculations. It is so accurate that NASA joined the game's developers to create new missions, and it now has a teaching-ready standalone game that could be used directly in university physics courses.\\nA unique approach has been taken with the biochemistry-based game FoldIt. This game serves as both an educational as well as a citizen science platform. In the game, players manipulate the structures of real proteins to search for the 'best' or lowest energy structures. Results published in the journal Nature showed that the player's search methods can be successfully combined with computer-based algorithms to solve actual scientific problems.\\nThe use of video games in higher education is a real possibility and could even have a promising future in higher education given the advantages of delivering educational content through a video game format. These advantages include things such as remote access, personalized student progress and immediate feedback. However, creating an engaging video game from scratch is challenging, costly and time-consuming. As indicated by the creators of PolyCraft World, finding existing games to modify for educational purposes \\u2013 like the research missions in Spider-Man \\u2013 could be the best way forward.\\nAaron W.

      "      \"summary\": \"Children (and adults, too) need to learn the principles of ecology (how life works in community), and they need to see the connections between human beings and the rest of Nature. The urgent timeframe of global climate change means that any learning that doesn't contribute to these understandings could be considered part of the problem.\\nIndeed, the environmental crisis can be attributed in part to the inability of human beings to come up with sustainable ways of living together.\\nHere are some ways to 'ecologicalize' teaching which is being practiced by the Cordillera Ecological Center in the Philippines:\\n1. Education programs sometimes include icebreakers, warm-up activities, initiative tasks, cooperative games, or physical adventure elements. Helping people work together better will always be a good thing, and creating a sense of community is essential for being eco-friendly. But how can we integrate environmental learning into these activities without drastically changing program elements and while still contributing to group dynamics and character building? It's not easy, but it's simple: We just need to stretch what we do to include mention of and learning about the rest of our natural 'place' and community.\\n2. Ecologicalizing education means looking for principles of ecology and connections with the rest of Nature in as many of our learning activities as possible.\\n3. Follow up to any learning task that demands group work or cooperation can lead to discussion of the behaviour of fish in schools or birds in flocks. How did participants communicate to each other? Why? How do the strategies they came up with to meet their challenge compare with fish or birds dealing with a challenge such as a predator?\\n4. A group activity that demands cooperation can lead to participants discussing the similarities between humans and other social animals. For example, you can help your students learn how wolf behaviour can act as a metaphor for effective group functioning, character development and leadership. That so many roles need filling to keep a classroom working well exemplifies the connectedness of the living web \\u2014 what happens to the 'web' within the physical and emotional space of the classroom if one participant falls down on the job? And how does this compare with losing one species or degrading one aspect of an ecosystem? Let's talk about these things with students.\\n5. If your education programming already includes lots of hands-on Nature connecting, you can highlight and reinforce ecological understandings by pointing out or asking for evidence of Nature's gifts or ecosystem services in action. This could be an ambulatory activity (one you do while walking between classes or travelling to different venues), or an ongoing project throughout the year.\\n6. Nature abides by rules. Games work well and reflect Nature if they combine rules with cooperation and some 'friendly competition' (in the sense that every individual is doing his or her best). Beware of overstressing competition \\u2014 the goal, it seems, of our culture. Ecology relies on mutualism (living things relying on each other), and life is all about synergistic symbiosis. In Nature, 'the fittest' is the one who fits into its ecosystem best. This is a lesson our students desperately need to learn.\",\n",

Now he's using what he's learned about turtles over the years to help them thrive. \\\"I'm very passionate about it. It's something I enjoy doing and I love giving back,\\\" he said. Yonkers learned a few things about wildlife rehabilitation when he was working as a veterinary technician and eventually he became a licensed turtle rehabilitator in Michigan. He brought a few of the turtles he's nursed back from injuries to a presentation in Muskegon Thursday night. The presentation covered identifying the 10 species of turtles in Michigan, their habitat, and some of the rehab work he does for injured turtles. Yonkers also talked about conservation efforts. \\\"Michigan does have four species of protected turtles. Those are protected largely because their populations are declining with habitat being destroyed or developed for houses or other things. Their environments are limited and some of these turtles might have to be 20 years old before they're at breeding age so that definitely hurts their environment quite a bit,\\\" he said. Yonkers says one of the best things people can do to help turtles is to know what to do if you see a turtle crossing the road. \\\"Move it in the same direction it's heading. Don't take it home. Don't take it to an environment you think is better for it. Just help it cross the road. The less interaction the better,\\\" he said. Since 2004, Michigan has been home to a Herp Atlas Project. It's a citizen science program create to document the state's amphibians and reptiles and help measure trends in their populations. The Michigan Herp Atlas relies on observations of amphibians and reptiles being submitted to the project's website. \\u25baMake it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.

      "      \"summary\": \"A Source\\u00a0Of Passion\\u00a0\\nJoshua Olatunji AYENI\\nA Nigerian student in China\\nAlthough there may be some drawbacks of taking part in extracurricular activities such as conflict of interest, time management and extra costs, the joy and fulfillment that students derive from pursuing their passions through these activities far outweigh the concerns surrounding the notion that extracurricular activities bring extra stress to the students mentally and the parents financially. This thought is nothing but phantasmagoric; as long as the activities are not forced on students, and they choose them based on their interests and capabilities.\\nIn my adolescent age, I was not deeply involved in extracurricular activities, not because of lack of interest but due to misinformation on how such undertakings could filch my time and significantly affect my studies. As time went by, I discovered that this reasoning was faulty and indirectly created some behavioral gaps and aversion in me. As I began to see the opportunities that have eluded me, I deeply regretted not participating earlier in such activities.\\nThanks to fate, I later joined some activities related to academics, volunteering and religion. Although these activities could be easily combined, my energy was focused on academics and religion. Besides peer tutoring, I was engaged in various competitions and club societies, and the experiences were thrilling and rewarding. Beyond equipping me for any form of academic challenges, extracurricular activities have helped me come in contact with dignified personalities.\\nExtracurricular activities have numerous positive impacts on the people that participate in them. They can change an overly ingenuous, introverted and reclusive person to an outright socializing individual. Since passion drives determination and commitment, extracurricular activities can bring about creativity, self-confidence, social inclusiveness, team spirit, leadership management and organizational skills.\\nThey also help students find their innate strengths, what their passions genuinely are and link them to like-minded persons.\\n\\u00a0\\nA Supplement to School Teaching\\u00a0\\nLi Shuhui\\nA civil servant in\\u00a0Jiangxi Province\\u00a0\\nThe value of extracurricular activities is recognized in China, because they provide experiences not available at school. But when it comes to extracurricular classes, especially those targeted at improving students' academic performance, opinions vary.\\nPersonally, I have benefited from these classes. When I was little, I took extracurricular piano and dancing classes at weekends. It was relaxing after a long week of study. Though I later stopped attending these classes and failed to become master of either art, I still enjoy playing piano after work sometimes.\\nThe reason I gave up was that I turned to extra mathematics and geography classes for additional tutoring in these subjects in high school, when I found it hard to keep up with the pace of school teaching. These classes did help raise my test scores.\\nSo, based on my experience, extracurricular classes are necessary and helpful when they cater to the interests and specific needs of students. But if these classes have added burdens to students, they may play a negative role to children's growth. The Ministry of Education recently set up a new department to regulate the development of the industry.\\nI think the main reason is that instead of serving as a supplement to school education, they have been trying to compete with schools by providing services that are similar to schools, but are ahead of school schedule or beyond the stipulated scope of teaching. The active promotion of their programs has made Chinese parents, who are known for caring about their children's academic performance, anxious. Those who don't want to see their children lag behind would spend a lot of money and time on these classes. I hope with government guidance, the industry can have healthy development.\\nSchools also have a part to play. I hope that in the future, schools in China can better respond to individualized needs and provide more diverse courses for students to choose from, so that students don't have to attend extracurricular classes.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Posted Friday, July 9, 2021 1:15 am Indiana marked the one-year anniversary of the Hands Free Driving Law on July 1, and local law enforcement officers find they are still working to educate the public. Deputies with the\\u00a0 Montgomery County Sheriff's Office have written 24 warnings and issued two citations since the new law took effect last year. Numbers were not provided for the Crawfordsville Police Department. Motorists who violate the law can be subject to a fine and can result in a Class C infraction. Moreover, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles has started adding points to driving records under that state law. The purpose of the law is to prohibit drivers from holding mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, in their hands while driving. In 2019, Indiana Criminal Justice Institute found that using mobile devices while driving led to at least 1,263 crashes and three fatal crashes. The state hopes the law reduces distracted driving and improves safety on the Indiana roadways. Drivers are instead recommended to use devices having any hands-free technology such as Bluetooth. GPS and other map apps are allowed only provided through hands-free technology. Drivers are expected to pull off the road safely at an appropriate location and bring the vehicle to a complete stop before holding a phone. Devices are only allowed to call 911 to report a true emergency. The state has been dealing with distracted driving for a long time. Indiana had a no text while driving law since July 1, 2011. However, there were problems with it. 'Before with the texting law, you had to really be able to see that the person was trying to communicate,' Crawfordsville Police Chief Aaron Mattingly said. 'Police officers essentially needed to see the thumb moving or something like that before you could really enforce it.' Furthermore, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals determined the law was unenforceable. However, the new hands-free law makes it easier for police officers to stop drivers. 'It is pretty straightforward,' Mattingly said. 'Whether drivers text, they are prohibited to hold the devices first of all while driving.' Montgomery County Sheriff Ryan Needham said the new law was a good idea because people are too involved with their devices. Although there are still some people who do not know about the new law, both local departments continue to educate people. They use social media platforms, and when necessary, explain to violators how the new law is important to maintain road safety. 'If someone does not understand why that is important, the officer can just simply explain,' Mattingly said. There is no statistical data yet to determine whether the new law has contributed to a decrease in car crashes in Indiana. However, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, states that have passed hands-free driving laws have seen a nearly 20 percent decrease in traffic deaths in the two years after passing the law. 'My expectation would just simply be to pay attention to the road and be mindful because that is a shared thing,' Needham said. 'We hope that people will comply with that.'\",\n",

This was an oversight on our part, and we conveyed our personal apologies in our communication with the government,' it said.The World Bank said the report was already 'temporarily' removed from its website.'Recognizing the inadvertent release of the report, we have taken steps to temporarily remove it from the website,' the World Bank said.The statement came after Education Secretary Leonor Briones on Monday demanded a public apology from the World Bank for releasing an 'outdated' and 'insulting' report on the supposedly poor education quality in the Philippines.The World Bank said it has reached out to Briones for a dialogue with DepEd with regard to the 'opportunities and challenges' in the Philippines' education sector.'We are aware of the Department's various efforts and programs to address the challenge of education quality,' it said. 'We agree with the Department that the issue of quality has a long historical context, and support its demonstrated commitment to resolve it decisively.'The World Bank report said around 80 percent of Filipino students fall below the minimum proficiency levels as 'they do not know what they should know in school.'Its report was based on the three assessments participated by the Philippines, including the Program for International Student Assessment (Pisa) in 2018, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in 2019, and the first cycle of the Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics (SEA-PLM) in 2019. The three global assessments, the World Bank said, showed that only 10 to 20 percent of Grade 4, 5, and 9 students in the Philippines posted scores 'at or above minimum proficiency.'The World Bank also said there is a 'crisis' in Philippine education 'which started pre-Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019)' and 'have been made worse' by the coronavirus pandemic.As of press time, the World Bank's report on Philippine education is 'being processed or is not available.'
