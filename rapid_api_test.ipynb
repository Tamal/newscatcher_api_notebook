      "      \"summary\": \"LoadingMs Berejiklian said she appreciated the message delivered on Friday was shocking, but that she needed 'everybody to be shocked'.'NSW is facing the biggest challenge we have faced since the pandemic started, and I don't say that lightly,' she said.'Unless there's a dramatic turnaround in the numbers, I can't see how we'll be in a position to ease restrictions by next Friday.'Do not leave your home. Do not leave your home unless you absolutely have to. That is what a lockdown is,' she said.Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said 43 people were currently in hospital due to COVID, with 10 people in ICU, four of whom are being ventilated.'Of the 10 people in ICU, one is in their 20s, one is in their 30s one is in their 50s, five are in their 60s and two are in their 70s,' she said.'This trend has to be turned around and the only way we can do so is by seeing a decline in numbers.'Dr Chant said people in suburbs like Kareela, Sylvania, Hurstville and Maroubra needed to stay particularly vigilant and come forward for testing.South-west Sydney remains of heightened concern, including suburbs like Bossley Park, Smithfield, Fairfield, West Hoxton, Bass Hill, Greenacre, St John's Park, Bonnyrigg, Bankstown, Canley Vale, Chester Hill and Edensor Park.Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday announced 300,000 extra vaccine doses would be fast-tracked to NSW to boost inoculations in south-west Sydney, targeting the 'most vulnerable in the community.'The doses will comprise equal components of both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines.Mr Morrison on Friday told Seven's Sunrise that Australia's vaccine troubles to date needed to be put into perspective.'We are in a global pandemic, it's as simple as that. Sadly, the program has had its challenges but ... when it comes to fatalities, deaths from COVID, that is the statistic, obviously, where Australia leads the world,' he said.'Just the other day, they had more cases in the UK in one day than Australia has had in the past 18 months. I think you've got to look at these things in balance'.A number of new western Sydney locations were added to NSW Health's list of COVID-19 exposure sites on Wednesday night, among them retail stores, cafes and supermarkets.Eleven of those are close contact sites, meaning anyone who attended at the relevant times must immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days no matter the result.The venues include Aldi and Kmart in Merrylands, both on Monday, July 5, between 1.30 and 3.30pm and Australia Post in Merrylands on July 5, from 2-3pm.Other venues include Kathmandu Burwood on July 4, from 12.35-1pm, Beds r Us Wetherill Park on July 5, between 2.30 and 3.15pm, as well as food outlets in Auburn and Smithfield.Sydney's hospitals are standing by to mobilise COVID-19 surge plans in preparation for the possible influx of people needing urgent care, with more than 10 per cent of the state's cases now in hospital.As the number of cases in intensive care climbs, the Australian Medical Association has warned the health system would be overwhelmed if the Greater Sydney lockdown was eased before spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant is contained.Stay across the most crucial developments related to the pandemic with the Coronavirus Update.

      "      \"summary\": \"Commentary\\n BC Pires \\n 2 Hrs Ago BC Pires - \\nTHANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY\\n\\n\\nBC PIRES\\n\\nLAST THURSDAY, 18,000-odd 11-year-olds sat the Secondary Entrance Assessment, all hoping to pass for a 'prestige school' which, in Trinidad, means one where the teachers are more worried about their students getting nine CXCs under their belt than they already having TEC Nines in their book bags. \\nLast Friday, I did the maths section of a Newsday practice test. Today I will wrestle with what we now call 'language arts' because we're too ashamed of how poorly we do 'English.' \\n\\nLanguage Arts. Section I. \\n \\nTask 1. Correct the six spelling mistakes:\\nSimba sirveyed the bed below him. The new dog, which the humans affectionatly called 'Chino,' was sleeping contently on it. Simba wanted to play! He swished his tale, wiggled and pounced on the creature. Chino howled and jumped! Simba felt satisfyed. The spelling mistakes are obvious, apart from 'contently' for 'contentedly,' which modern 11-year-olds will think isn't a mistake at all, because they will think it refers to 'content,' ie, any stupid 15-second video they post on TikTok, but you have to look for the cultural/socio-economic errors. Unless Simba and Chino are pets in a stoosh household, eg, what the firetruck are they doing on the bed? Except possibly in Westmoorings, Trinidad dogs are outside in the rain. With one end of an old rope tied around their neck and the other to a mango tree valued more highly than them. \\n\\nTask 2. Correct the six punctuation and capitalisation errors:\\nromano observed the tadpoles and fish darting between rocks in the pond As he stared at them in awe a voice shouted, 'Boo'. romano fell into the pond. His brother, Trevor, exclaimed, Got you!' There is a lot more wrong with poor Romano than not having his name capitalised, such as having a surname for a forename and not having a PS4 or any gaming platform at all \\u2013 otherwise why would he be in awe of tadpoles and fish darting in a firetrucking pond? This is a little boy in Trinidad, not Sir David Attenborough on the BBC. Romano's biggest problem, though, is clearly his brother, Trevor, who got the good first name and who has poor Romano in such an extended state of hyper-anxiety, he needs to watch tadpoles to calm down. Romano's best correction will be to NEVER stand near the edge of any precipice if Trevor is within shouting distance. \\n\\nTask 3. Correct the six grammar errors:\\nBlack vultures known as 'corbeaux' at Trinidad are important to the environment and helps to keep it clean. Despite they reputation around being dirty, black vultures often clean itself by bathing in rivers and streams. Before the grammatically incorrect, we must deal with the politically incorrect, viz, why are the vultures being described as 'black?' It is now racist to use 'black' as a descriptive, following the penalising of the European football club official who identified the only black person on the field by saying, 'the black guy' instead of, say, 'the third-tallest player on the team that is losing at the moment' or 'the player nearest the goalpost who is not the goalie, no, wait, the player who is second-nearest\\u2026 no, wait, third-nearest\\u2026no, wait\\u2026'\\nThere is also a distinct possibility of anti-Indian racism coming into play because the dirty black vultures clean themselves by bathing in rivers. Why not the sea? Why the river? To me, the imputation is clear that there must be some duck currying in a pot somewhere, ergo, the most correctest thing to do is to set all future SEA questions in villages in England, with rosy-cheeked blonde children doing all the heavy-social media-storm-avoiding-lifting in the exam questions. \\nWe could even do the maths section with sums out of my old 1969 arithmetic textbooks, which required Trinidadian children to add up and subtract pounds, shillings and pence. \\nAnd then we could formally reverse independence. \\nAnd maybe come out of it and into West Indian Federation next time. \\nChanges to the SEA have made it impossible to do, in a newspaper column, the 'comprehension,' or to write what used to be 'the essay' but is now, regrettably, 'ELA \\u2013 presumably English Language Arts \\u2013 Writing.' \\nWhich starts with something called 'Prewriting,' further sub-divided into Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action and Resolution, which sounds more like a Friday night in a club and a quarrel and she went home than a primary school essay. That's enough SEA to drown in. \\n\\nBC Pires is a dunce with Newsday and, ergo, about to be appointed to the Cabinet. Read the full version of this column on Saturday at www.BCPires.com\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"CONTRIBUTOR To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. COVID 19 virus took the world by surprise. It started as small China problem and subsequently to become a global pandemic \\u2013 the entire world problem. The net effect has been that national governments have to impose strict measures including lockdowns, social distancing, wearing of face masks, washing of hands and others to minimize the catastrophic effect of it. Notwithstanding the above, lives are been lost daily and infection rates are still at its peak. Businesses has also had their fair share of the catastrophic effect of the pandemic. Businesses have been folded up, some struggling and others working on rotation basis. Scientist advised that the surest way to get pandemic under control is to get all and sundry vaccinated to minimize the spread, avoid severe illness and death. Unfortunately hand full of covid 19 vaccines have been approved, by relevant bodies, to be safe and effective to fight the covid.\\u00a0 Recently Ghana's Government in an effort to minimize and control the various managed to secure about 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Vaccine for the country. The doses imported were not enough to vaccinate the entire population, however, at some point more vaccines will be approved and there will be enough vaccines for all persons who are willing to be vaccinated. Notwithstanding the obvious benefits of the vaccines, there is still high rate of potential vaccination hesitancy. Several people both young and old have decided not to take the vaccination. Some attribute it to religious beliefs; trust in the efficacy of the vaccine and others conspiracy theories. So far there is no law or policy in Ghana that makes the vaccination mandatory. However some employers in their quest to return business back to normal and also to complying with their obligations under the 1992 constitution and the Labour law may make policies and decisions that will compel employees to take the vaccine. We will discuss whether such measure or policies can be lawful? OBLIGATION ON EMPLOYERS TO MAKE WORK PLACE SAFE AND HEALTHY Employers who may want to make Covid 19 vaccination mandatory at their work places will argue that by the combine effect of Article 24(1) of the 1992 constitution and Sections 10(a) and 188(1) impose a duty on employers to ensure that every worker employed by it works under satisfactory, safe and healthy conditions. Creating a satisfactory, safe and healthy conditions include taking reasonable and practical steps to minimize or prevention the spread of Covid 19 virus at the work place. And one of the reasonable and practical steps is making Covid 19 vaccination mandatory.\\u00a0 EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO REJECT VACCINATION Whiles employers have to right to make Covid 19 policy mandatory, the Employees on the other hand also have the right to refuse vaccination. Employees have a fundamental human right which is guaranteed under the constitution to refuse or accept any medication of any sort. Therefore a person cannot be compelled without their consent to undergo medical treatment, including vaccination. On that basis, employees can also reject any attempt to compel them to undergo vaccination treatment. BALANCING RIGHT The rights of the employer and the employees indicated above, none of it can be classified as an absolute right. Therefore in the event they contradicts none will automatically takes precedence over the other. This means any potential mandatory policy cannot automatically takes precedence over an individual fundamental right and freedom to decide whether or not to take the medication. When such event happens, employers to avoid any potential liability, should be prepared to justify such policy.\\u00a0 The employer should be prepared to justified that aside the mandatory requirement there were no practical alternatives or mechanisms that was sufficient enough to meet their obligations. Another justification may be that the nature of the work employees were undertaking is such that it has become necessary that they undergo the vaccination exercise. In a decided case in Canada, specifically, employers engaged in the provision of health care and residential care services, especially those catering to the elderly or immunocompromised, it was found that it was justified in temporarily removing employees who refuse to be vaccinated. The policy must also be connected to the employer's legitimate business interest. A mandatory policy that protects employees, client and patient health and safety have been held to be legitimate business interest in other jurisdiction. WHAT EMPLOYERS MUST DO Notwithstanding that Employers may have a legitimate right to impose mandatory vaccination, it is highly recommended that they encourage voluntary vaccination. Employers can also introduce incentives to staff to encourage them to vaccinate. Further most of the vaccine hesitancy are due to little information or misinformation about the vaccination. Employers can seek help of health professionals to educate their employees about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine to alley any fears they might harbor. Notwithstanding the above, if it becomes necessary that the policy has to be implemented, the employer should ensure that the policy does not contradict with the existing employment agreement or collective agreement. The policy should also not be unreasonable. Last but not the least the policy should be clear and unequivocal.

      "      \"summary\": \"Govt's last Covid chance\\n\\nToday, the Centre for Covid19 Situation Administration (CCSA) meets to debate imposing more stringent Covid measures in Bangkok and its vicinity as well as the the four southernmost provinces in a new bid to battle Covid-19.\\n\\nIn doing so, the CCSA has deliberately avoided using the term \\\"lockdown.\\\" The measures, nevertheless, amount to a soft lockdown.\\n\\nSet to take effect for 14 days, the steps would lead to Bangkok and its vicinity being sealed off, with inter-provincial travel banned.\\n\\nEssential businesses still will be allowed to operate, while shopping malls, supermarkets and fresh markets will be asked to cut their hours. Some businesses may even be asked to close their doors for two weeks.\\n\\nPeople will be asked to stay home, and go out only when necessary such as to buy food. The quasi-lockdown measures were proposed by the Ministry of Public Health, with a clear and singular mission -- to prevent the public healthcare system from collapsing as the number of patients outstrips the capacity of state hospitals to treat them.\\n\\nThe CCSA forecasts that total Covid cases might surpass 10,000 cases per day by next week.\\n\\nThe public health crisis justifies the semi-lockdown measures despite their potential knockout effect on the economy.\\n\\nYet the Prayut government cannot afford a repeat the mistakes it made in managing the crisis over the past 18 months.\\n\\nThis time, the government must respond quickly as needs arise to inject money, soft loans, grants or even give relief items directly to affected business and workers to help them make ends meet.\\n\\nAs the 14-day Covid measure will hit daily wage workers and street vendors hardest, the government must make sure they have enough food and money to survive.\\n\\nBut the most urgent priority is for the CCSA's operations centre to work harder and smarter to control people's movements including risk groups such as labourers.\\n\\nIn past 18 months, it has failed in this crucial task. Take the persistent problem of illegal entry by migrant workers from neighbouring countries which has led to cluster infections. One glaring example came early this month when hundreds of construction workers managed to flee their camps as the state tried to lock the camps down, leading to Covid infections in more than 30 provinces. Needless to say, failure is not an option this time.\\n\\nAnd no more flip flops on vaccines. The Public Health Ministry has revised its vaccination plan regularly to accommodate the needs of the economy and the state's plans to reopen the country.\\n\\nBut as the latest Covid measures are designed with public health as the uppermost concern, the ministry must regain its focus and spend every minute it can on providing quality vaccines to vulnerable groups including the elderly, not to mention front-line workers.\\n\\nIt must also accelerate Covid testing capacity in the capital as well as build more Covid isolation and field hospitals.\\n\\nThe government has 14 days, its last chance to restore battered public confidence in its performance.\\n\\nOf course, the new quasi-lockdown will trigger debate and it is impossible for the government to satisfy everyone in a country that has been so polarised; but the government can help bridge the gap and unite people by being transparent, accountable and fair.\\n\\nAnything else, and the next 14 days could spell the end for this government.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"In a new study assessing the potential of a single-dose, intranasal COVID-19 vaccine, a team from the University of Iowa and the University of Georgia found that the vaccine fully protects mice against lethal COVID-19 infection. The vaccine also blocks animal-to-animal transmission of the virus. The findings were published July 2 in the journal Science Advances.\\n\\nThe currently available vaccines against COVID-19 are very successful, but the majority of the world's population is still unvaccinated and there is a critical need for more vaccines that are easy to use and effective at stopping disease and transmission. If this new COVID-19 vaccine proves effective in people, it may help block SARS-CoV-2 transmission and help control the COVID-19 pandemic.\\\" Paul McCray, MD, professor of pediatrics-pulmonary medicine, and microbiology and immunology at the UI Carver College of Medicine, and co-leader of the study\\n\\nUnlike traditional vaccines that require an injection, this vaccine is administered through a nasal spray similar to those commonly used to vaccinate against influenza. The vaccine used in the study only requires a single dose and it may be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures for up to at least three months. Because it is given intranasally, the vaccine may also be easier to administer, especially for those who have a fear of needles.\\n\\n\\\"We have been developing this vaccine platform for more than 20 years, and we began working on new vaccine formulations to combat COVID-19 during the early days of the pandemic,\\\" says Biao He, PhD, a professor in the University of Georgia's Department of Infectious Diseases in the College of Veterinary Medicine and co-leader of the study. \\\"Our preclinical data show that this vaccine not only protects against infection, but also significantly reduces the chances of transmission.\\\"\\n\\nThe experimental vaccine uses a harmless parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into cells where it prompts an immune response that protects against COVID-19 infection. PIV5 is related to common cold viruses and easily infects different mammals, including humans, without causing significant disease. The research team has previously shown that this vaccine platform can completely protect experimental animals from another dangerous coronavirus disease called Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\\n\\nThe inhaled PIV5 vaccine developed by the team targets mucosal cells that line the nasal passages and airways. These cells are the main entry point for most SARS-CoV-2 infections and the site of early virus replication. Virus produced in these cells can invade deeper into the lungs and other organs in the body, which can lead to more severe disease. In addition, virus made in these cells can be easily shed through exhalation allowing transmission from one infected person to others.\\n\\nThe study showed that the vaccine produced a localized immune response, involving antibodies and cellular immunity, that completely protected mice from fatal doses of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine also prevented infection and disease in ferrets and, importantly, appeared to block transmission of COVID-19 from infected ferrets to their unprotected and uninfected cage-mates.\",\n",

I quarantined for 10 days before returning to Portugal and have had 5 laboratory PCR tests in the last 12 days, all negative.

They are happy to imprison everyone else but for them it is clearly not applicable, when they should be leading by example. Don't get me wrong I am not trying to avoid doing the quarantine, I am simply wanting an exception to get my second vaccine dose which all the ministers (Cabrita, Sales etc) are reported as saying this is the nations priority. This is completely crazy, unfair and stupid, and I think this is something that needs to be reported to the public. Best regardsCRAIG ANDERSON By email\",\n",

Sadly, the program has had its challenges but ... when it comes to fatalities, deaths from COVID, that is the statistic, obviously, where Australia leads the world,' he said.'Just the other day, they had more cases in the UK in one day than Australia has had in the past 18 months. I think you've got to look at these things in balance'.A number of new western Sydney locations were added to NSW Health's list of COVID-19 exposure sites on Wednesday night, among them retail stores, cafes and supermarkets.Eleven of those are close contact sites, meaning anyone who attended at the relevant times must immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days no matter the result.The venues include Aldi and Kmart in Merrylands, both on Monday, July 5, between 1.30 and 3.30pm and Australia Post in Merrylands on July 5, from 2-3pm.Other venues include Kathmandu Burwood on July 4, from 12.35-1pm, Beds r Us Wetherill Park on July 5, between 2.30 and 3.15pm, as well as food outlets in Auburn and Smithfield.Sydney's hospitals are standing by to mobilise COVID-19 surge plans in preparation for the possible influx of people needing urgent care, with more than 10 per cent of the state's cases now in hospital.Ms Berejiklian said at the start of the pandemic NSW quadrupled its capacity to hospitalise people with COVID, including in ICU, but that she hoped the state would not have to call on that extra capacity.\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"Hundreds of thousands are dead, partly thanks to the Kremlin's incompetence | Europe\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"FOR THE past year the Kremlin has trumpeted its success in fighting covid-19. It eschewed lockdowns and hailed its home-grown Sputnik V vaccine. In early June, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, boasted to thousands of guests at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, billed as the world's largest post-pandemic international gathering, that 'the current situation in Russia allows us to hold such events without any particular risk of spreading the infection.'In fact, by the time Mr Putin was addressing his powwow, Russian doctors had for several weeks been registering an alarming rise in infections and deaths. A month later, Russia is in the midst of its third and most severe wave of covid-19, with more people dying daily than at any point during the pandemic (see chart).The number of new daily cases is currently around 25,000, somewhat fewer than in Britain, and rising. But whereas in Britain this surge has translated into an average of 18 daily deaths over the past week, in Russia it has resulted in an average of 670 deaths a day.The contrast is all the more striking because Russia was the first country in the world to approve a working vaccine, one based on the same science as the British-Swedish AstraZeneca one and apparently just as effective. But whereas in Britain 78% of the population has received at least one jab, in Russia the proportion is only 20%. The difference is not the availability or the efficacy of the jab, but people's trust in the government and its vaccines.All of this could have been avoided. A year ago the government decided to lift a partial lockdown (Mr Putin called it 'a holiday'), hoping to save itself money and to prop up the president's faltering popularity after a prolonged slump in incomes. Mr Putin's ratings did go back up\\u2014but so did the risk of infection.As the second wave hit Europe in late autumn last year, the Kremlin chose not to spend money on supporting people and businesses through a new lockdown. It left people to their own devices, playing down the risks, with Mr Putin boasting about the contrast between lifeless European cities and Moscow, where restaurants, theatres and shops stayed open.But the numbers lied. By February 2021 Russia had one of the world's highest excess mortality rates, according to numbers compiled by The Economist. At that point it had registered 460,000 more deaths than normal, while its official covid-19 death toll was a more modest 85,000. But by in effect removing all restrictions and fiddling the numbers, the government managed to create a false sense of security.This was just when people should have been urged to get vaccinated, says Denis Volkov of the Levada Centre, an independent pollster. Despite the staggering true number of deaths, in February his polling found that 57% of people were not worried about catching the virus. Most worryingly, two-thirds of the country rejected the idea of getting vaccinated.The government, meanwhile, had other priorities, such as jailing Alexei Navalny, the most prominent opposition figure, and crushing street protests. This is where social-distancing rules came in handy. Mr Navalny's associates were put under house arrest for 'urging the public to violate epidemiological restrictions'. At the same time Mr Putin packed 80,000 people into the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow for a ceremony to mark the seventh anniversary of the annexation of Crimea.Many Russians concluded that the rules were merely a government ploy, to be evaded like so many of its prescriptions. They took a similarly dismissive view of the Sputnik V vaccine after its launch, with much fanfare, in early December.Sputnik V was authorised before the results of its phase-3 clinical trials were ready. Once these were published, questions were raised about some inconsistencies and data availability, says Boris Reizis, a professor of immunology at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine. Still, he says, the data suggest that Sputnik V is at least as safe and effective as other adenovirus-based vaccines, such as those made by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. But the damage had been done.To be sure, confidence in vaccines is fragile everywhere. But in Russia nobody has done more to undermine such confidence than the Kremlin and its loyal, conspiracy-peddling media. Mr Putin has hijacked Sputnik V for the purpose of geopolitical point-scoring. Yet he dithered with his own vaccination until the end of March and refused to be photographed being injected, despite his usual penchant for bare-chested publicity stunts. He has also suggested that vaccines from other countries are unsafe.That has done little to reassure the many Russians who expect their government to lie to them. They have good reason: it turns out that some people who were told they were getting Sputnik V were in fact given EpiVacCorona, another Russian vaccine praised by Mr Putin, but about which there are serious concerns. Hardly any countries have approved it.Failing to win trust, Russian authorities are resorting to sticks and carrots. In Moscow, restaurants and caf\\u00e9s are allowed to serve people indoors only if they have a QR code proving they have been vaccinated. Hospitals refuse routine treatment to anyone without a jab. Public-sector and service workers have been ordered to get vaccinated. But although more people are now signing up for jabs, there is a side-effect: a thriving black market for fake vaccination certificates, QR codes and medical exemptions. None of this bodes well for hospitals across the country, as the numbers continue to mount. \\u25a0Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub.

The Prime Minister said South Australians who returned from 'low-risk' countries would be able to participate in the pilot. Mr Morrison said SA indicated its interest in hosting the two-week pilot program \\u2014 which will be based on the advice from a medical panel \\u2014 at Friday's meeting. He said the project would be transparent, with all the other states and territories observing the outcome. '(This is) so they are in a position to pick up that project on the completion of a successful pilot program,' Mr Morrison said. 'We will work with them (SA) now to set up a time frame of how that will be put together and transparency arrangements for the other states and territories.'Mr Morrison said it was 'an important development' that could take significant pressure off of the quarantine system, if successful. Premier Steven Marshall said the state's response to the pandemic put it in 'an ideal position' to volunteer for the trial that would be under 'stringent safety protocols'. He said it would likely include returning Paralympians or ADF personnel who received the vaccine in Australia.'It will progress only under strict safety and surveillance measures and only when approved by our public health experts,' Mr Marshall said.'While we will be the first jurisdiction to return South Australians through home quarantine, it is expected other states will then adopt the system.'Earlier on Friday, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said both SA and NSW had previously expressed interest in participating in a small-scale trial where alternative quarantine options could be explored. 'One of the things the work done so far tells us is that a vaccinated person quarantining for seven days is stronger than an unvaccinated person quarantining for 14 days,' she told ABC radio.As part of SA's public health response, it established a dedicated Covid-19 positive medi-hotel where people who contracted the virus were transferred to complete 14 days of isolation. There are other hotels across the CBD where returned travellers whose tests were negative undergo their fortnight of quarantine.

      "      \"summary\": \"In response to Nicholas White and colleagues, we offer these clarifications. WHO guideline development methods are prespecified, abiding by principles for producing trustworthy guidelines. The WHO COVID-19 Therapeutics Guideline Development Group (GDG) is composed of external experts, with geographical representation and gender balance, including COVID-19 survivors, ethicists, and methodologists who are vetted for potential conflicts of interest. The GDG prioritises outcomes and identifies subgroups to be considered for each recommendation, always including age and disease severity (using WHO COVID-19 definitions of non-severe, severe, and critical). As WHO guidelines need to be globally applicable, the GDG deliberately used these disease severity classifications, based on clinical indicators, to assess subgroup effects rather than stage of disease (viral and inflammatory phases). The GDG avoided using access to health care (inpatient or outpatient) to define patient subgroups because who is admitted to hospital, when, and how can differ substantially across jurisdictions.The meta-analysis team did a network meta-regression based on the prespecified subgroup variables, focusing on within-trial rather than between-trial comparisons. The GDG assessed the credibility of results from the subgroup analyses using the Instrument to assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses tool,4Schandelmaier S Briel M Varadhan R et al.Development of the Instrument to assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) in randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.CMAJ. 2020; 192: e901-e906Crossref\\nPubMed\\nScopus (0)\\nGoogle Scholar which uses structured questions to derive an overall credibility rating. Regarding hydroxychloroquine treatment for COVID-19: after assessing results, the GDG concluded there was no credible subgroup effect for disease severity and thus issued a strong recommendation against hydroxychloroquine that applied across severities. Finally, WHO has issued separate guidelines for therapeutics and prophylactic drugs, with separate analyses for these indications, thus never pooling efficacy estimates for drugs used to treat COVID-19 with estimates of effects to prevent the disease.

Unfortunately, they do not address our main concern: the unjustified extrapolation of evidence from randomised controlled trials in severe COVID-19 to therapeutic guidelines for uncomplicated illness.1 Pooling summary data from studies with different severity definitions, deciding on inappropriate primary outcomes, and extrapolating from results in hospitalised patients to ambulant individuals with mild infections suggests a worrying lack of clinical judgement.

Under the restrictions, face masks had to be worn in public when social distancing was not possible. A mandatory mask-wearing order was also in place for places like supermarkets, shopping centre and hairdressers as well as on public transport, taxis and ride-share services. There was a cap on home visits, with a maximum of 10 people being permitted at the property.A check-in system was compulsory and hospitality venues were only allowed to operate with seated service.Indoor exercise, like gyms, pilates and yoga studios, were closed and only non-contact sports was permitted.NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner said Territorians did a 'fantastic job' in following the health directions and 'doing the right thing'.'Our lockdown has worked in trapping the virus and Territorians have helped to contain this outbreak within two weeks,' he said.More to come.

      "      \"summary\": \"A full movement control order has been in place nationwide since 1 June 2021. Although it has brought some respite and an easing of the pandemic in some states, the condition has been seriously worsening recently in both the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, with both areas contributing more than 60% of the new cases in the country. KL and Selangor's consistent R-naught value of above 1.0 may be reflective of increasing transmission, and the increasing cases are pushing healthcare capacities in the region to a breaking point. The spread between new cases and recovered cases that started to widen early this week (July 4) was the red alert indicating healthcare systems struggling to cope with surging cases. This prompted the authority to enhance MCO in most areas in KL and Selangor from July 3 to July 16. The overall testing intensity nationwide has been on a general decline while test positivity rate has been soaring higher (Figure 1). Figure 1: New cases, new tests and positivity rate by weeks (Data Source: Ministry of Health, Malaysia) However a breakdown of the numbers shows that some states are testing more than others, including Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. Despite Kuala Lumpur and Selangor testing more than most states (especially Selangor with testing numbers roughly 2 - 3 times that of Kuala Lumpur), the corresponding high test positive rates could indicate that the spread may already be too wide. Therefore, Selangor should focus on containment strategies and vaccination while ideally maintaining the relatively higher levels of testing. Other states, including KL, may need to increase testing alongside strict containment and vaccination. In consideration of resource allocations, we refer to our suggestion that the testing exercise ride on the vaccination campaigns, utilising the same place and manpower available. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that Kuala Lumpur and Selangor are the busiest business areas. Every day of the prolonged and stringent lockdown brings more micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) closer to the cliff. Therefore, the situation requires an urgent, strategic, multipronged and unprecedented response to not only alleviate the situation but to minimise possibility of its painful recurrence. To achieve this, EMIR Research builds on our earlier 'Exit Strategy Building Blocks for Malaysia' published on Jun 17, 2021. The three main goals remain: 1) complete lockdown, 2) extending safety net to KL and Selangor and 3) speed up vaccination. However, given the urgency of the situation whereby every day matters, we bring in new and important strategic tactic based on robust scientific evidence. Firstly, a total lockdown is crucial. If done correctly i.e, a real 'total' lockdown in KL and Selangor for at least 2 weeks to a maximum of 6 weeks as was intended at the start of MCO 3.0 will help cut transmission, slow down new infections and ease the distressful healthcare situation in these states. Secondly, extended strictness and time of the lockdown will require a deepening of the safety net for vulnerable lives and businesses in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, Among the specific recommendations which EMIR Research would like to reemphasize is the automatic opt-out loan moratorium and enhanced renters' protection for all\\u2014individuals and MSMEs in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. The basic principle of financial management tells us that it is possible to survive the income downfall if you can reduce your operating and financial leverage\\u2014this is where the Government will need to deepen its approach. Therefore, to mitigate the proposed total lockdown in Kuala Ku and Selangor, the Government should mandate and closely monitor the implementation of a true automatic opt-out loan moratorium for all with no change of terms or interest / fee charge attributed to the months of the moratorium period. This is a serious issue as some banks may still try to leverage the 'opt-in' feature. At least for Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Government should also consider changing the incentive approach with the landlords into the form of temporary law measures similar to other countries. For instance, the Government could temporarily mandate equitable co-sharing of rental obligations between the Government, landlords and tenants and make eviction illegal, at least until we transit into Phase 3 of the National Recovery Plan. The biggest share should be by the Government, followed by the landlord, and minimally (or none) born by the tenants. Lastly, but not least, is to increase the rate of vaccination as thus far it has been our best bet against the raging pandemic and the only hope for speedy return to some form of normalcy. The objective of massive vaccination is to at least protect larger proportion of population from the disease severity, hospitalizations, and deaths, even if infection was to happen. However, given, and only given the urgency of the situation, the same objective can be achieved through exploiting natural immunity to Covid-19 to win precious time and save lives and livelihoods. Notably, this idea has been mooted by the scientists since the start of 2021. To date, there are at least eight credible peer-reviewed studies published in reputable medical journals that aim to ascertain whether natural Covid-19 infection offers protection against this infection and how lasting it is. All eight studies are done in various periods during the year 2020 (before the vaccines), in various countries such as Austria [1], Denmark [2], Qatar [3], Switzerland [4], United Kingdom [5, 6], United States [7, 8]. Two were done among the healthcare workers while the rest on a nationwide samples. To trace infection or reinfection these studies used PCR tests, serological tests or both. Importantly, those who used both approaches found remarkable similarity in their results. Unanimously, these studies established the strong empirical evidence of protection from Covid-19 following natural infection (estimated efficacy ranging from 79% to 95%) lasting 7 months at average among these studies (as seen from the range of the observed period where this estimated efficacy was measured). Interestingly, both studies at the lower side of the efficacy range have been done in the medical setting where lower efficacy could be explained by higher levels of exposure to viruses and higher viral load received. Furthermore, three out of eight studies observed the protection rate increasing towards the end of observation period. Importantly, the majority of reinfections were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Only five cases of hospitalization after re-infection were reported across the studies and only one study reported 1 death out of 14,840 previously infected people, involving a 72 year old person. These findings are especially important in the view that available antibody assays measuring neutralizing antibodies may observe lowering antibody titre after a few months post infection, which is also a scenario that has been reported for Covid-19. However, the protection against severe symptoms, strong evidence of which we observe in the above studies, could be manifestation of the fact that the protection of the immune system involves more than just antibodies and include other important immune actors such as T cells and B cells, which may not be measured in current Covid-19 assays and may play an important role in what we observe. This is a well-established mechanism of immune response to many diseases. Due to significant cost involved in capturing this deeper immune response, the relevant studies are rather scarce. One such very recent longitudinal study published in Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal, assessed the immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. By continuously examining blood of 254 Covid-19 confirmed cases (age 19 to 81) the scientists established that despite antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) declined moderately over 8 months, memory B cells against SARS-CoV-2 spike actually increased between 1 month and 8 months after infection. About 95% of subjects retained immune memory at about 6 months after infection. Therefore, all these findings very plausibly suggest the possibility to exploit natural immunity and prioritise vaccination for those never been infected at least in the short-term (which can be as long as 7 months post infection) in the situation of shortage of either vaccine or time or both. The only exception should be naturally infected elderlies (as one study did find significantly lower protection of those 65 and above), people with comorbidities and those whose vascular and other vital systems have been severely damaged during the first infection. This approach also capitalises on the vast number of people infected in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, which may be excluded first, to make way for others to be vaccinated. In other words, there are justifiable grounds based on empirical studies that most of the infected people would retain infection immunity within the said months, or at least, would still have protective immunity against severe symptoms. Therefore, in practice, particularly in an extraordinary emergency setting, these individuals may be treated like 'vaccinated' individuals for a set period of time. Thus, by temporarily excluding these individuals, the target of maximising protection to the population of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor may be significantly expedited. As vaccine doses arrive in the span of the coming months, these naturally infected people that were postponed for their vaccination, can then start to receive their jabs. The efforts to increase throughput of vaccination in KL and Selangor such as door-to-door vaccination for the bedridden can also supplement the vaccine prioritisation/postponement strategy. It must be stated here that this does not mean getting infected is a good strategy, especially when we have vaccines. It is only an emergency measure in view of the need to speed up population protection and/or in the backdrop of vaccine scarcity. Fatality rates of infections without prior immunity (be it from vaccines or natural infection) appear to strongly suggest Covid-19 to be more lethal than your average flu. Some sources estimate the fatality rate is 10 times more than the common cold. Therefore, doing nothing and taking infection lightly will not be the solution and would be detrimental in the grander scheme towards recovery. Following the above tactic, while in full lockdown the authorities should start with the factories, various service companies and construction sectors in KL and Selangor as they continue to be the largest cluster contributors. Therefore, and favourably enough to this strategy, the large number of workers might be already protected with the natural immunity. The authorities may start with first screening workers IC / ID in the national epidemiological reporting system among previously PCR-confirmed cases and exclude those who are falling within the aforementioned protection period. For example, if the postponement period target is 1 month for the naturally-infected population, then we can consider only those that were infected and recovered in the last 6 months. Beyond 1 month of this strategy, the infected people can then be treated normally given the assumption that we have no vaccine supply issues and that by this time most, if not all population in KL and Selangor have been protected. For conservatism and in leaning even more towards safety, authorities may even consider a shorter period than the seven-months average duration, though the trade-off would reduce the number of eligible naturally-infected people that can be considered for exclusion. One particular aspect that has not been directly addressed by the sources mentioned or studied is the impact of new and emerging virus variants against the immunity of naturally infected and recovered people. It is postulated that these individuals may confer some level of protection against some variants (at least those that have not mutated too significantly) since natural infection may illicit not only the production of neutralising antibodies based on only one target antigen (like the spike, for example), but also triggering immune response involving other crucial immune components such as T and B cells by involving not only the spike but other parts of the virus that may be less susceptible to mutations. One way to begin elucidating and verifying this hypothesis is to also conduct antibody measurements and virus sequencing as mentioned earlier. Similar to the vaccine postponement strategy, any negative findings here may call for the approach to be reconsidered. Overall, this strategy has very calculated risk given the ample empirical support. Furthermore it can be treated as a case study and if successful extended to other states of Malaysia to near our recovery. The rakyat is suffering and it requires urgent, strategic, multipronged and unprecedented response guided by science and economic needs.

Even as the country's daily COVID count halved in the last one month, the state has been recording a steady 11,000 to 13,000 cases every day.Nearly every other state has been recording a decline in daily case count, according to a report in The Indian Express. The state breached the 15,000 mark twice this week on July 6 and 7. On Thursday, the state reported 13,772 fresh cases. The test positivity rate was at a high 10.83 percent.According to the report, in a way, the first wave never ended in Kerala as the state continued to record 5,000-6,000 cases every day in January 2021, when even Maharashtra's daily count fell to 2,000. A similar scenario seems to be playing out now.Although Kerala's new caseload has been higher, the relatively fewer deaths can be attributed to the state's better handling of the pandemic. On the other hand, the low fatality ratio of 0.47, against the country's average of 1.32, can partly be because of the large number of cases. Higher case count can also be partly attributed to better reporting, proven by serosurveys. The last national serosurvey showed that for every infection that is detected, about 25 go unreported. A similar survey in Kerala earlier this year found only about five unreported infections for every reported case.'When a person tests positive, we test all close contacts of that person, family members, etc. This kind of targeted testing is keeping the test positivity rate high,' the reported quoted Veena George, Kerala's new Health Minister.George had also said that the state always ensured that the total caseload always remained within the capacity of its health infrastructure.In the first meeting with new ministers after the cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concerns over the persistently high cases from Kerala and Maharashtra. He stressed that there should be no space for carelessness or complacency, a source told PTI.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"This week the UK government announced the roadmap for the full re-opening of the events sector in England from 19 July. Events businesses will need consider the latest guidance on the use of COVID-status certification.\\n\\nOver the last year we have become accustomed to the sight of \\u2018behind closed doors' events and reduced capacity crowds, whilst a huge number of live events have of course been cancelled. Recent weeks have seen fantastic scenes with fans attending Royal Ascot, large crowds at Wembley for Euro 2020 matches and the prospect of a full Centre Court for the Wimbledon Championship finals. However these recent mass-events have all taken place under the government's pilot Event Research Programme, which mandated strict requirements of vaccination status and negative COVID tests (so called COVID-status certification or COVID-passports) as a condition for entry. For future large scale events, event organisers will need to determine their own entry requirements and policies for use of COVID-status certifications. The guidance is also apply to hospitality venues such as pubs, nightclubs and restaurants.\\n\\nThe new government guidance, which applies to England only, provides that from 19 July:\\n\\nthe use of COVID-status certification as a condition of entry for visitors to any setting will not be mandated \\u2013 event organisers and venues will be free to determine their own rules;\\n\\n'Essential settings should not use certification, but others can decide to use it at their own discretion in compliance with legal obligations' \\u2013 accordingly event organisers and venues may choose to insist upon COVID-status certification as a condition of entry. The guidance elaborates that 'Essential settings and those that have been able to stay open throughout the pandemic should not use certification';\\n\\nFor venues which choose to require COVID-status certification, the government has suggested using the NHS COVID Pass system (NHS COVID Pass for events and travel - NHS (www.nhs.uk)), which provides users with digital and paper routes to a 'Pass' if they meet one of the following criteria:\\n\\n2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in England (provided the second dose was at least 2 weeks prior)\\n\\nNegative PCR test or rapid lateral flow test within the past 48 hours\\n\\nPositive PCR test within the past 6 months\\n\\nWhilst the NHS COVID Pass system will provide a standardised and convenient way to verify COVID-status certification, operators will also be required to accept other forms of proof of status, e.g. text results of tests and paper letters.\\n\\nFollowing this guidance, venue owners and operators will need to consider:\\n\\nWhether they wish to impose any COVID-status certification requirements as a condition for entry; Processes for implementing the NHS COVID PASS system and how to cater for the needs of customers that do not have access to smartphones or other digital means; How to communicate policies and requirements to customers; Whether ticket / venue entry terms and conditions require updating to reflect any new entry policy; and Refund policies for ticket holders who no longer wish to attend or are unable to attend due to their COVID-status certification.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Ambulance staff carry the body of a COVID-19 victim in India. /AFP Ambulance staff carry the body of a COVID-19 victim in India. /AFP Editor's note: Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, political analyst and freelance reporter. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. According to data published by Johns Hopkins University on July 7, the global death toll attributed to COVID-19 had risen past 4 million. While some countries, like the United States and those in Europe, are doing far better than before thanks to their privilege in being able to secure enough vaccine doses for their populations, many countries in the Global South are still struggling.Global North countries are continuing in their unlocking plans pretty much unabated for the most part thanks to their high rate of vaccination, which, even though there are COVID-19 flare-ups across some regions, there is nowhere near the same strain on hospitals. On the upside, it means that current vaccines work and people in these parts of the world are transitioning into living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease; something which experts have long suggested was the eventual outcome of the pandemic.On the other hand, the global media and public have largely become desensitized to the staggering death toll that is continuing around the world and have lost perspective. It's true that the daily global death figure now is significantly less than the peak in January (7,900 now versus more than 14,700 at that time), but it is still 57 percent higher than the same time last year.At the same time, the 1 million death mark was reached on September 29, 2020. After that, it took around 115 days to reach 2 million, 88 days to pass 3 million, and 89 days to reach 4 million. It means that there have been far more deaths in 2021 from COVID-19 than there were in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.This is only according to official numbers. Since deaths are being driven by so-called developing countries, it's likely that they are significantly underreported and the death toll in reality is far higher. Experts believe this is the case even in so-called developed countries like the United States, which alone accounts for 15 percent of the official global death toll.This still-dire situation around the world in regards to the pandemic highlights the reality of global inequality, namely, the chasm between the Global North and Global South. While the Global North is unlocking, many parts of the Global South remain vaccine deserts untouched by the ray of hope that is inoculation against the virus. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic is by definition a global issue, allowing the Global South to go empty-handed in the final stages of this battle will inevitably backfire. Graves of whose who passed away due to the coronavirus disease are pictured at the Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus, Brazil, May 20, 2021. /Reuters Graves of whose who passed away due to the coronavirus disease are pictured at the Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus, Brazil, May 20, 2021. /Reuters As more transmissible and potentially more virulent variants of COVID-19 emerge thanks to a wide variety of vectors resulting from this vaccine inequality, these variants, which could evade an immune response, will certainly find their way into the Global North. By this logic, it is quite literally in these countries' interests to help the Global South push ahead with their vaccine drives.To be sure, this does not just mean donating vaccines from their own stockpiles as the G7 countries have already pledged. Their 1 billion pledged doses would still be woefully inadequate to meet the demand of the Global South, where most of the world's nearly 8 billion inhabitants reside.Global North countries should ramp up their vaccine production, halt unilateral sanctions that threaten supply chains in the case of the United States,\\u00a0and end the disinformation campaigns against successful vaccines produced in places like Russia, China or Cuba.Rich countries are beginning to wind down their fight against COVID-19, which is good for them, but they should not forget that the pandemic is a global issue. They have not only a moral imperative, but also a very real self-interest at stake, in furthering the global vaccine drive, especially in the Global South.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at opinions@cgtn.com.)\",\n",

Vulnerable communities most years in Fiji deal with the aftermath of cyclones and flooding desperately needing support to rebuild their homes and replace chattels. Fiji has made great strides in recent years 'building back better' following these events. Covid is different as the destruction has a greater impact on livelihoods due to loss of jobs and income as borders are closed to their main income earner tourism. Health resources are stretched leaving people in rural areas very little in the way of support. Large numbers of the most vulnerable often live in informal settlements and squatter villages. One of Rotary's partners in Fiji continues to reach out to those who have no option but to live in overcrowded accommodation including dwellings often made from cardboard, wood, corrugated iron, plastic sheeting and metal from oil drums etc. with lack of sanitation, clean drinking water and open sewers. Pollution and disease is not uncommon. A number of New Zealand based International NGO's are supporting Fiji along with Rotary. Rotary's response is at the grassroots level directly to identified communities who have not received support from other agencies.

The Covid-19 Pandemic had a profound effect on the world economy and on how businesses operated in order to survive. One could be forgiven for believing that the value of currency in circulation - travelling through our economy in money bags would have plummeted considerably during this period (due to the requirement for hygienic cashless transactions). However, the truth is that the reverse occurred. According to the RBA (Australia's reserve bank), the arrival of Covid-19 significantly increased the value of banknotes in circulation. This is similar with previous moments of economic insecurity, when people sought to accumulate cash as a precautionary store of wealth (storing currency in secure storage bags) . This trend is not unique to Australia; it has been observed in a number of other nations as well, including Japan, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, and New Zealand.\\u00a0 Feel free to read the report here https://www.acma.gov.au/publications/2020-04/report/impacts-2019-20-bushfires-telecommunications-network Digital technology does not leverage physical cash assets that can be protected using tamper evident packaging solutions. Cash's utility as a preventive store of wealth is not confined to pandemics on a global scale. Recent flooding events in New South Wales, which impacted a range of critical services, including the region's electricity infrastructure, demonstrated another significant advantage of cash: it is not leveraged by digital technology. As Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe put it, \\\"cash does not require the internet to be up, electricity to be working and the banks' systems to be operational.\\\" This failsafe is critical in an age when our crucial systems are getting more technologically advanced through the use of digital processes. Obviously, this requirement is not limited to flooding, but applies to any occurrence that has an effect on our digital systems. The bushfires of 2019-2020, which consumed more than 46 million acres and destroyed at least 3,500 homes, also had a significant impact on the country's digital networks. The Australian Communications and Media Authority stated the following about our telecommunications and internet infrastructure: (can be found here https://www.govcms.gov.au/customers/australian-comunications-and-media-authority ) During the evaluation period, 1,390 facilities were impacted by bushfires, either directly or indirectly. 51% of all afflicted facilities suffered outages lasting four hours or more during the review period, while 26% experienced outages lasting less than four hours. The average duration of outages was 3.5 days, while the median duration was 1.6 days. ACMA \\u2014 The 2019-20 bushfires' impact on the telecommunications network. Covid-19 has ingrained and heightened dread of the unknown. Returning to our initial discussion of cash holdings and Covid-19, the RBA's study reflected the same concern about digitally leveraged systems potentially dictating behavior during a pandemic. Cash holdings exceeded cash deposits in 2020, and the RBA's report indicates that, in addition to the generalised uncertainty associated with Covid-19, this particular anxiety was due to the possibility of disrupted electronic payment systems. This was demonstrated by the fact that cash withdrawals increased in March 2020 as the stormy year began to take shape. While reality looked a little different, with businesses declining cash as a safeguard for their employees and digital systems remaining operational, the anxiety was justified. There is widespread agreement that Covid-19 has instilled an underlying sense of insecurity in the global population. If someone had told us at Christmas in 2019 that we would be experiencing a catastrophic disruption to life as we know it for the following 12 months (and, when all is said and done, perhaps for the next 2-3 years), we would have laughed. Flights would be grounded, masks would be required, and residents could only leave the house for a brief period to perform errands or purchase food - we would have dismissed them as neurotic \\u2013 Nonetheless, here we are. This catastrophe will leave psychological wounds on the globe as a whole, even as the environment continues to deteriorate. When you combine the now-ingrained and heightened fear of the unknown with the possibility that future calamities may be natural in nature, destroying the physical infrastructure required for our digital systems, the concept of currency is likely to feel more secure than ever. All of this means that, in an age of technological innovation and reliance on digital systems, currency remains a stable and critical component of our economic architecture. As vaccines are distributed globally and the sun slowly rises on a post-covid world, we must remember this period as a lesson in economic insecurity... We must remember that we require ways in which we must prepare for the unexpected.Will Paton RollsPack Pty Ltd +61 3 9588 0055 email us here Visit us on social media: Facebook LinkedIn You just read: EIN Presswire's priority is source transparency.

      "      \"summary\": \"JULY 9, 2021 Updated 4 hours ago Podcast: The Detail While New Zealand and the Cook Islands are bubbling away, the Covid situation in what used to be our biggest Pacific tourism destination, Fiji, is horrifying - and out of control.\\u00a0 Fiji's Covid crisis gets worse by the day, but thousands of people are so desperate for food they risk their lives by crowding into buses without masks to get to shops and hospitals. The country, with a population of more than 900,000, had avoided Covid in the community for the first year of the pandemic. But since an outbreak in April after a quarantine breach, 7870 cases have been recorded with 40 deaths. That figure is already outdated as the numbers rise daily. \\\"We expect the situation to get far, far, far worse,\\\" says Sashi Kiran, founder of FRIEND, the Foundation for Rural Integrated Enterprises and Development. \\\"We're just mopping the floor, feeding the people, organising the medicines, trying to get people into livelihoods because we're not turning the tap off, we're not halting the virus.\\\" Today, The Detail talks to Kiran in Fiji about the poorest families on the brink of disaster because they have no jobs and no food. Up to 30,000 people have applied to FRIEND for help and every week it is getting food and medicines to 1300 families. They are low-income earners, from the ice cream seller to the juice maker and the wheelbarrow boy. They have no savings, they've been surviving more than two months with no income, and they have no national social protection. Many live in crowded squatter settlements and they are also the most vulnerable to Covid. Recently the government made a one-off $50 payment per family but Kiran says it is not enough. \\\"It barely gets you food, and then there's fuel, and then medicines. \\\"And each time there is a social protection like the $50, people line up to get the (money) and each time that happens we have thousands of people getting exposed on a daily basis.\\\" Kiran says supermarkets have become Covid hotspots and the government needs to get food trucks and caravans out to people to stop them going into towns. Before Covid struck, FRIEND was helping low-income families set up small farming and food production enterprises. Now most of its work is in Covid disaster assistance. She wants the government to change its message so that it reaches people who are most vulnerable. \\\"For example, any squatter family or any person in a village and in Nadi in particular where people were normally renting, have moved into family homes because they can't afford rent and bills. So a house may have 10 to 15 people maybe with one toilet facility. How do you avoid contact in a family like that?\\\" RNZ Pacific reporter Christine Rovoi explains to The Detail the outbreak started when two people arrived with the Delta variant from India. A soldier providing security at a quarantine facility caught the virus and was isolated but he breached protocol when he had contact with a maid. The maid and other soldiers took the virus into the community and to a funeral attended by 500 people from many parts of the country. Rovoi says the government was overconfident with its response and only locked down part of the main island, Viti Levu. \\\"I think it was a bit of being too confident about them being able to maintain such a good record. They got too cocky in a way.\\\" The response and the messaging has caused confusion, anger and anxiety, says Rovoi, and it's exacerbated by the economic crisis. \\\"To be honest, the government doesn't have any money.\\\" Late last month New Zealand announced $10 million for Fiji Covid response operations and organisations working with vulnerable households. New Zealand medical specialists are already there and others are being canvassed about doing a stint there. The government has also sent equipment including $820,000 worth of PPE gear. New Zealand is also funding the vaccination of 250,000\\u00a0people in Fiji with AstraZeneca. Sashi Kiran says her organisation and other NGOs are trying to get container loads of hospital beds, bedding and medical equipment. People who wish to donate can contact Kiran at FRIENDfiji.com.

      "      \"summary\": \"By Paula Martins, in COVID-19, News \\u00b7 09-07-2021 01:00:00 \\u00b7 0 Comments This information has been circulating on blogspots through the internet claiming that from January 2020 to April 2021 only 152 people really died of Covid-19 - instead of the 17,000 people, which are the numbers confirmed by the Directorate General of Health (DGS). This would mean that the other cases would be from people who, although tested positive for Covid-19, could have died from any other reason. However, this is completely out of context. After reading all the Lisbon court ruling (https://andre-dias.net/wp-content/uploads/Fwd-Sentenca.pdf), and analysing it very carefully, we found out that there are missing points that make all the difference. The number of 152 deaths of Covid-19, presented in the judgment, is not fake, but it is based on a wrong premise \\u2013 that all death certificates are issued by doctors who work for the Prosecutor's office (MP), because it's about these death certificates issued by doctors working in the MP that the judgment writes about. However, these doctors are not the only ones who are allowed to issue death certificates. On the contrary, normally, in case of death, the patient usually was already being followed by a doctor and it is this same professional that issues the death certificate. The MP is only called when there is something indicating a death caused by a criminal act. If the person dies at home, the doctor, who was following the patient, is called to go to that house and issue the death certificate at the location. On the other hand, if someone dies in the hospital, the hospital's doctors themselves issued that certificate. In both cases, normal doctors don't need the public prosecutor's doctors to fulfill their mission. In most cases, death has a natural cause and is a result of a diagnosed disease that evolves or worsens, of identified pathological antecedents. In these cases, the intervention of the MP is very rare, which explains the low number of death certificates issued by the MP related to Covid-19. Therefore, it does not seem strange that in a universe of 17,000 deaths by Covid-19, only 152 were certified by the doctors of the MP, as apparently people were already being followed and nothing pointed to the possibility of death due to a crime that justifies the intervention of the MP. The rule of the Administrative Court of Lisbon, in which this information comes from, began from a dispute due to the right to access to administrative information.\",\n",

OHA reported 1,189 new daily cases of COVID-19 during the week of Monday, June 28, through Sunday, July 4. That represents a 13% decrease over the previous week. New COVID-19 related hospitalizations declined by 40%, to 66, from 110 the previous week. There were 19 reported COVID-19 related deaths, up from seven reported the previous week. There were 62,307 tests for COVID-19 for the week of June 27 through July 3. The percentage of positive tests was 2.9%. People 70 years of age and older have accounted for 38% of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and 74% of COVID-19 related deaths. There are two new COVID-19 related deaths in Oregon, raising the state's death toll at 2,790. Oregon Health Authority reported 212 new confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19, bringing the state total to 209,973. The number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 across Oregon is 100. which is six fewer than Wednesday. There are 28 COVID-19 patients in intensive care unit (ICU) beds, which is three fewer than Wednesday. The new confirmed and presumptive COVID-19 cases reported today are in the following counties: Benton (4), Clackamas (23), Columbia (4), Crook (2), Deschutes (10), Douglas (5), Jackson (18), Josephine (15), Klamath (8), Lane (7), Lincoln (4), Linn (13), Malheur (3), Marion (23), Morrow (1), Multnomah (13), Polk (2), Tillamook (7), Umatilla (21), Union (2), Washington (17), Yamhill (10).

He had underlying conditions.\\nOHA reported that 10,824 new doses of COVID-19 vaccinations were added to the state immunization registry. Of this total, 7,482 doses were administered on July 7 and 3,396 were administered on previous days but were entered into the vaccine registry on July 7. The seven-day running average is now 5,406 doses per day. Oregon has now administered 2,564,438 first and second doses of Pfizer, 1,752,116 first and second doses of Moderna and 172,177 single doses of Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines. As of today, 2,421,075 people have had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 2,217,891 people have completed a COVID-19 vaccine series. Cumulative daily totals can take several days to finalize because providers have 72 hours to report doses administered and technical challenges have caused many providers to lag in their reporting.

The variant, which has been detected in more than 90 countries, is expected to spread to others.\\nIt has also been linked to a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation.\\nThere are ongoing studies on its impact on existing vaccines and therapeutics.\\nIhekweazu further stated that as part of Nigeria's COVID-19 response, NCDC has been working with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID) and other laboratories within the national network, to carry out genomic sequencing.\\n'This is to enable the detection of variants of concern and initiate response activities', the NCDC boss stated.\\nAll data on variants from Nigeria have been published on GISAID, a global mechanism for sharing sequencing data. Given the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, positive samples from international travelers to Nigeria are sequenced regularly.\\nThe Federal Government, through the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC), has initiated several measures to reduce the risk of coronavirus spread.\\nThe introduction of travel restrictions from countries where there is a surge in cases associated with the variants of concern is one of such measures.\\nThe national travel protocol which includes compulsory seven-day self-isolation and repeat tests on the seventh day after arrival, have also been put in place to reduce the risk of spread of the virus.\\nRead Also:\\u00a0Afreximbank tackles COVID-19 with $1.5b facility Ihekweazu said in a statement: 'It is very important that this is strictly adhered to, to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.\\n'Given the high transmissibility of the Delta variant and following its detection in Nigeria, NCDC urges all Nigerians to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures in place. Proven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives.\\n'The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against the disease.\\n'Additionally, states are urged to ensure sample collection and testing for COVID-19 is accessible to the public.\\n'Public settings, such as schools with accommodation facilities, workplaces and camps, should utilise the approved Antigen based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for rapid testing of their population.\\n'Although we have seen a low number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria in the last eight weeks, it is incredibly important that we do not forget to be careful. The surge in cases in countries across the world and Africa is an important reminder of the risk we face.\\n'Please protect yourselves and the people you love by adhering to the known public health and social measures, getting vaccinated if you are eligible and getting tested if you have symptoms'.\\nThe recommended control measures to limit the spread of the Delta variant continue to be tested, following the existing public health guidance and abiding by the current travel and public restrictions.\\nThe daily positive COVID-19 figures were on the rise yesterday as the NCDC announced 110 new cases.\\nLagos State accounted for 88; Rivers (12); Akwa Ibom (four); Jigawa and Ogun (two each) and a case each in Kano and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\\nThe total number of confirmed cases, according to the NCDC data stood at 168,110, out of which 164,408 have been discharged and 2,122 deaths recorded.\",\n",

They beat the Mountainairs 90-87 in New Plymouth on May 20 and the Jets by 28 points in Palmerston North a month later.The playoffs will be in Porirua on July 22-23, with the Wellington Saints (12-2 with Saturday and Sunday matches this weekend), the major hurdle between the Hawks and the franchise's first NBL crown since 2006.Chairman Keith Price says crowd numbers for the seven home matches to date have been good \\u2013 \\\"up around 1400-1500\\\" - and is hoping for more as the side plays its last two matches at home. The capacity is over 2000.A star in all the home games has been mascot Hawky, mainly off-court, apart from a moment or two of exuberance which landed the club a $200 fine a fortnight ago.There's been huge support ever since for the sideline ace, and the man behind the image \\u2013 Eleazer Spooner, a former Karamu High School basketball most valuable player who now also performs with a Hastings dance troupe.Most NBL sides have mascots but Price reckons Hawky is the best, with few aware of the ordeal going on under the suit.Picking the suit up from the drycleaner on Friday, Price said: \\\"It gets pretty hot under there, by the time the game ends he's probably spent two hours in there.\\\"\",\n",

Video / NZ Herald Nick Kyrgios has confirmed he has pulled out of the Australian Olympic team heading to Tokyo after a week of speculation.Throughout his Wimbledon campaign, rumours were swirling that he was planning on heading to a tournament in Atlanta rather than Tokyo but had remained silent on the subject so far.Kyrgios was forced to retire hurt from his round three Wimbledon clash with Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime with an abdominal injury.Kyrgios told reporters at Wimbledon that as it stands, with all the Covid-19 restrictions in place, the Olympics don't appeal to him as much as they would if they were being held outside of a global pandemic.Nick Kyrgios has withdrawn from the Olympic Games. Photo / Getty ImagesBut news that Tokyo was declaring another state of emergency that would see no fans in the stands appeared to be the final straw as Kyrgios revealed on social media that it was the main reason he would skip the Games.\\\"Hey Guys \\u2013 I just want to let you know that I've decided to withdraw from the Olympics. It's a decision I didn't make lightly. It's been my dream to represent Australia at the Olympics and I know I may never get that opportunity again. But I also know myself. The thought of playing in front of empty stadiums just doesn't sit right with me. It never has. I also wouldn't want to take an opportunity away from a healthy Aussie athlete ready to represent the country. I will also take all the time I need to get my body right. Good luck to all the Aussies competing and I'll see you back on the court real soon.\\\"Olympics. pic.twitter.com/ydj1V7jh2t\\u2014 Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) July 8, 2021\",\n",

Video / NZ Herald Fans will be banned from Tokyo-area stadiums and arenas when the Olympics begin in two weeks, the city's governor said Thursday after meeting with organisers of the pandemic-postponed games.That means the Olympics will be a largely TV-only event, after the Japanese government put the capital under a Covid-19 state of emergency because of rising new infections and the highly contagious Delta variant.The declaration was made by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, and the spectator ban was agreed to by Japanese Olympic organisers, the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, and the metropolitan government of Tokyo.It's a serious blow for Japanese taxpayers and local organisers of the games, which had already been postponed from 2020 by Covid-19. Hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket revenue will be lost, and that must be made up by the government. Fans have also endured months of uncertainty about whether the Olympics will go ahead.\\\"Many people were looking forward to watching the games at the venues, but I would like everyone to fully enjoy watching the games on TV at home,\\\" Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said after the meeting. \\\"It's gut-wrenching because many people looked forward to watching at the venues.\\\"Fans from abroad were banned months ago, and the new measures will mean no spectators in stadiums and arenas around Tokyo \\u2014 both indoor and outdoor venues.Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. Photo / APThe state of emergency begins July 12 and runs through August 22. The Olympics, which open July 23 and run through August 8, fall entirely under the emergency period, while the Paralympics open August 24.\\\"Taking into consideration the impact of the Delta strain, and in order to prevent the resurgence of infections from spreading across the country, we need to step up virus-prevention measures,\\\" Suga said.In principle, the July 23 opening ceremony at the new $1.4 billion National Stadium will be without paying fans, although some dignitaries, sponsors, IOC officials and others will be allowed to attend.\\\"We will have to review the situation about the dignitaries and stakeholders,\\\" organising committee President Seiko Hashimoto said of the opening ceremony.\\\"No fans was a very difficult decision.\\\"Hashimoto acknowledged some regrets, particularly about the decision coming so late.\\\"We had no choice but to arrive at the no-spectator decision,\\\" she said. \\\"We postponed and postponed, one after another. I have done some soul-searching about that.\\\"The emergency declaration made for a rude arrival for IOC President Thomas Bach, who landed Thursday in Tokyo for the games. He attended the virtual meeting on fans from his five-star hotel for IOC officials where he was self-isolating for three days.\\\"What can I say? Finally we are here,\\\" Bach said, sounding upbeat as he opened the late night meeting that ended close to midnight. \\\"I have been longing for this day for more than one year.\\\"Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the organising committee, said many sponsors, federation officials and others would be considered to be \\\"organisers\\\" and thus would be allowed to attend venues. He said some might occupy public seating, but he said he did not know \\\"the numerical details.\\\"Tokyo Olympics Minister Tamayo Marukawa. Photo / APOrganisers had expected to generate about $800 million in ticket sales. Any shortfall \\u2014 and it could be almost the entire amount \\u2014 will have to be made up by Japanese government entities.Japan is officially spending $15.4 billion on the Olympics, and several government audits say it's much larger. All but $6.7 billion is public money.Two weeks ago, organisers and the IOC allowed venues to be filled to 50% of capacity, with crowds not to exceed 10,000. The state of emergency forced the late turnaround, which was always an option if infections got worse.On Thursday, Tokyo reported 896 new cases, up from 673 a week earlier. It's the 19th straight day that cases have topped the mark set seven days prior. New cases on Wednesday hit 920, the highest total since 1,010 were reported on May 13.The main focus of the emergency is a request for bars, restaurants and karaoke parlours serving alcohol to close. A ban on serving alcohol is a key step to tone down Olympics-related festivities and keep people from drinking and partying. Tokyo residents are expected to face requests to stay home and watch the games on TV.\\\"How to stop people enjoying the Olympics from going out for drinks is the main issue,\\\" Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said.People wearing face masks walk past the Olympics Rings statue in Tokyo. Photo / APThe rise in infections also has forced the Tokyo city government to pull the Olympic torch relay off the streets, allowing it only on remote islands off the capital's coast.\\\"The infections are in their expansion phase and everyone in this country must firmly understand the seriousness of it,\\\" said Dr Shigeru Omi, a top government medical adviser.He urged authorities to take tough measures quickly ahead of the Olympics, with summer vacations approaching.Omi has repeatedly called for a spectator ban, calling it \\\"abnormal\\\" to stage an Olympics during a pandemic.A government Covid-19 advisory panel on Wednesday expressed concerns about the resurgence of infections.\\\"Two-thirds of the infections in the capital region are from Tokyo, and our concern is the spread of the infections to neighboring areas,\\\" said Ryuji Wakita, director-general of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.The Olympics are pushing ahead against most medical advice, partially because the postponement stalled the IOC's income flow. It gets almost 75 per cent from selling broadcast rights, and estimates suggest it would lose $3 billion to $4 billion if the Olympics were canceled altogether.About 11,000 Olympians and 4400 Paralympians are expected to enter Japan, along with tens of thousands of officials, judges, administrators, sponsors, broadcasters and media. The IOC says more than 80 per cent of Olympic Village residents will be vaccinated.Nationwide, Japan has had about 810,000 cases and nearly 14,900 deaths. Only 15 per cent of Japanese are fully vaccinated, still low compared with 47.4 per cent in the United States and almost 50 per cent in Britain.\",\n",

The Group 1 520m winner has drawn to serve a repeat dose from her handy two-trap draw.Bigtime Cooper owns the firepower to not only match her, but also to cross her during the rush into the first turn. The winner of $135,519 was impeded during the initial rush for positions last week which saw him whacking away for his three-length third.Splitting the above pair last Friday was Big Time Harley who was huge when he closed to within a 1.25 length margin from Jilliby Litsa. He was mounting a sustained finish when he copped a checked entering the final turn.Last Friday's 17.60s 305m winner Big Time Ziggy has been allocated the one-trap for the main 305m sprint (race 7). Cole produced her to lead all the way and her draw provides her with repeat claims.Kennelmate Big Time Fuzz continues to deliver her range of competitive sprints. She chased home Big Time Ziggy for her 2.25 length second last Friday, then she did likewise when finishing a half-length runner-up to race rival Big Time Gwyn in Monday's Palmerston North 410m dash. Expect a similar bold effort again.Yes, Big Time Gwyn held on gamely for her on-the-pace 23.38s Monday 410 win. She tends to mix her sprints at this venue however her podium claims cannot be lightly dismissed here.And a similar comment can be made for Big Time Fairy who landed her C3/4 meet best 17.58s 305m win last week. She adds to the puzzle that this field presents.Pina Colada was also a C3/4 305m winner last week when she led throughout for her 17.71s win. She can spice up the race combos from her trap-eight draw for her conditioners Jake and Daze Bell.\",\n",

(Front) Kaitlin Revell (Wellington), Phoebe Collier (Taihape), Polly Wenlock (Porirua), Alice Fahey (Wellington).River observers over last weekend may have noticed a larger than usual contingent of young female rowers training from the Aramoho Whanganui Rowing Club boat house.A squad of New Zealand Women's Under 21 and Junior (Under 19) scullers ventured onto the placid waters at Aramoho under designated lead coaches Nick Barton and Fiona Bourke.Barton, now based at Lake Kar\\u0101piro, as the lead coach of the NZ Junior Rowing Programme, is no stranger to Whanganui, having attended Whanganui Collegiate School in the mid 1990s and was a member of the first VIII for two years. He has built an impressive rowing coaching background at school, university, and with NZ Junior Women's crews.Bourke, born and raised in Takapau, did not commence rowing until she attended Otago University. She progressed rapidly, representing New Zealand in various crews from 2010, culminating in winning the gold medal at the World Championships in 2014 with Zoe Stephenson in the women's double sculls.Bourke commented that her international rowing career was led by Dick Tonks and while she had previously raced on the Whanganui River, it was great to be coaching on the same water that Dick had learned and applied his outstanding skills.The Whanganui River is rapidly becoming known as a nursery for producing many of New Zealand's elite crews over many years.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"The wrap\\n\\nJust when you thought it was safe to back into the water! No, nothing has been resolved; the waters are as murky as ever. The six is no closer to being resolved. Harbour finally awoke with the thought it might miss the six and put an under strength GI side to the sword. Varsity got up late over Southern to take the crucial points and leave Southern on the knife edge. Taieri destroyed the previously high flying MAQ's (Kaik) by 40 to confirm a spot in the six with GI. Dunedin did enough to get the five points off an under strength Zingers outfit, but with the bye this week its fate is not in its own hands.\\n\\nSo what does it all mean? GI and Taieri are in and Kaik is more or less there, as Zingari has only one fit front rower currently and is trying to arrange 'loan' players to come in so it can front this weekend. Its injury toll was huge and it lost another four last Saturday against the Sharks. Southern has to beat AU tomorrow to make it but the word is Coltman and Nareki are fronting for the Ponies, so touch and go. Harbour has to beat Taieri at the Eelpit to make it and that is no easy feat. Varsity has to get a point out of the GI game to confirm a spot. Dunedin can just wonder. So GI, Taieri and Kaik are in the other three too close to call. You can guarantee one team is going to be bitterly disappointed. What a comp!\\n\\nRipleys Believe it or Not\\n\\nThis is a true story. One of the proprietors of the best known pub in Kaikorai Valley must have had a large night in the last couple of weeks because he tried dialling a taxi on the 'sky remote' and couldn't believe it when the taxi didn't arrive \\u2013 I kid you not. Call in and mention it when you're passing.\\n\\nSpeaking of vehicles. One of our sales staff at the ODT took a blue company station wagon to see a client the other day. Upon coming out of the meeting she pushed the 'key clicker' and jumped into a car and off to the next meeting. She couldn't understand why she had to adjust the seat and radio. After the next meeting she finally noticed she was driving a grey station wagon. I kid you not, true story.\\n\\nThe Claytons tour\\n\\nSo NZRU picked a NZ Colts team to go to Aussie and they assembled a couple of weeks ago to prepare. In the interim, Covid struck again, so the tour was gone. Instead of sending the players home to their clubs to hopefully play finals footy they hastily arranged games against a Tasman XV and the Cook Islands \\u2013 really? The NZRU is really only paying lip service to grassroots rugby \\u2014 the rest is platitudes!\\n\\nYet more strain on club resources\\n\\nSo the Otago side has been named and no real surprises apart from Charles Elton not being named, but I hear he could be brought in. To make it even harder on clubs, Southland has been sniffing round in Mackintoshes and dark glasses. Tufui and Misiloi from Harbour are gone, Grayson Knapp from Kaik has disappeared and rumour has it the GI centre may also have signed. It's hard work running a club, let me assure you.\\n\\nCountry rugby\\n\\nIn the North it's too confusing, so I'll wait till they have a real final \\u2014 they are in preliminary mode, apparently. In Central, Upper Clutha takes on the Cromwell Goats in the final in old Cromwell town. The Goats haven't been beaten forever, so they should prevail. As an aside, I was talking to 'PL' Anderson (guest selector this week) and he was telling me he and Clarkey \\u2014 both well into their 80s \\u2014 have been going to rugby together since they were 5 years old, first as players, then administrators and now spectators \\u2014 great work lads and hopefully many more. I'm in South Otago tomorrow covering Clutha Valley v Heriot for Rugby Chat \\u2014 come up and say gidday if you are heading along. This is the last round, with the finalists already decided \\u2014 they're just working on the order.\\n\\nOther bits\\n\\nJake Fowler, from GI, plays his 50th game this weekend \\u2013 good on ya mate. The word from the High Veldt is the MAQs are in crisis mode with secret meetings happening in every changing room \\u2013 surely not!\\n\\nThis weekend\\n\\nDecimated Jeff Hollaway last weekend \\u2014 simply no challenge. On to Gareth Weatherston from GI, so at least a contest. Kaik (13+) will easily account for Zingers if the game gets played. AU (12-), strengthened, might just tip up the Magpies at Bog Bathgate. GI (12-), with some players back, do enough at the Toolbox to beat Varsity, just. The Eels (12-) are hitting their straps and there is no love lost between them and Harbour. Eels by a fin.\\n\\nGod I'm good in Country and got the perfect 60 last week, so 'Mr Ibby' had no chance. On to 'PL' Anderson from Upper Clutha, so I remain unbeaten. The Goats will beat Upper Clutha 15-12 \\u2014 take it to the bank.\\n\\npaul.dwyer@alliedpress.co.nz\",\n",

Photo / PhotosportThe formation of an Auckland racing super club is now a reality after Auckland Racing Club members voted yes to a merger with Counties in a move which will rejuvenate the thoroughbred racing industry.Members of the ARC club voted heavily for the merger at their special general meeting at Ellerslie last night, two days after Counties Racing Club members had done the same.Only two of the 120-130 members present at Ellerslie voted against the amalgamation.The two clubs will now merge to form Auckland Thoroughbred Racing Incorporated (ATRI) which will commence on August 1, the start of the new racing season.After that, all meetings held by at Ellerslie and Pukekohe Park will be run by the new club, which now needs to be registered and then the historic move is all but complete.\\\"It is an incredibly exciting time that a lot of people in both clubs have worked hard to make a reality,\\\" ARC chief executive Paul Wilcox said last night. \\\"We are proud of the way our members have approached the process and then made the decision to be open to a brave new future for racing in this region. And we are thrilled at the yes vote.\\\"The new ARTI will have the time and the expertise to do what is right rather than what is needed as land parcels can be developed, leased or sold, most notably the famous Ellerslie steeplechase hill, so ATRI can establish an investment fund to maximise returns.But while that will mean jumps racing ends at Ellerslie, club bosses committed at last night's meeting to helping jumps racing, including their iconic races such as the Great Northern, to continue at another venue.Racing will continue long-term at Ellerslie and Pukekohe Park but Ellerslie will take a break, after the Cup meeting next March, to install a StrathAyr track to provide a better winter racing surface.During that time meetings will be moved to other venues including Pukekohe and Avondale, which is likely to stay in operation until 2025 and then close with the Avondale Jockey Club to remain autonomous but race predominantly at Ellerslie.The eventual pooling of the three clubs assets could see sustainable income push stakes toward an average of $100,000 per Saturday race at Ellerslie in a few years, a dream figure for most in the struggling industry.That should help keep horse people and horses in New Zealand as finally the industry will have at least one track to compete with the rich Sydney and Melbourne tracks.It will also have somewhere for New Zealand-based trainers, owners and jockeys to aspire to, with Ellerslie set to attract the best horses from around the North Island as they chase stakes double or triple what other tracks will be able to offer.While there is still work to be done, starting with the committees of the two clubs now voting on who will be on the board to initially steer ARTI through its transition into life, the light at the end of racing's dark tunnel just became much brighter.\",\n",

Photo / Trish DunellTrainer Ken Kelso is expecting major improvement from Shoshone in the feature sprint at Te Rapa tomorrow.Kelso, who trains in partnership with his wife Bev, is one of the more astute preparers in the country but was all but forced to extend Shoshone out to 1400m in her last race, even though he wasn't sure how she would handle it.\\\"I think the 1200m will suit her a lot better than the 1400m last start because she just didn't handle the trip,\\\" says the Matamata trainer.\\\"It was a listed race and the black-type tempted us to take her to Tauranga last start but she didn't stay the 1400m and we know that now.\\\"So back to the 1200m this weekend on a heavy track, I think that suits her and I think she will go better.\\\"Shoshone is rated only a 78 horse but she looks a true open sprinter on winter tracks, with all four of her wins coming on soft or heavy, her ability to handle the wet shared by so many of the stock of her late sire Sacred Falls.That and the fact she has premiership winner Danielle Johnson in the saddle from barrier two, which should enable her to stay handy and dictate her own line on the winter track, suggests she is a great each-way bet after opening at $5.50.Still, it is a quality field for a winter sprint with Central Districts visitor Justaskme able, Dawn Patrol proven at far higher levels, Crystallize ideally suited by tomorrow's conditions and Palm Springs on a steep improvement curve.The Kelsos also have two each-way chances in the last race on the card in Henry Hudson and Diamond Delight.\\\"Henry Hudson is dropping back from 2100m to 1400m and the question will be whether we have been able to freshen him up enough for that,\\\" says the trainer.\\\"So while they are both chances I think Diamond Delight might be our better chance.\\\"She was impressive winning two starts ago and then a good fifth in a strong three-year-old race here last start.\\\"Meanwhile, the Kelso's stable star Levante is still spelling but due back in work soon.\\\"With the way the tracks can be here in the spring we are in no rush to get her back because we won't be aiming at the Foxbridge or the Hawke's Bay Triple Crown.\\\"Her targets will be after that and we will see how she comes up before we start discussing things like an Australian campaign.\\\"\",\n",

He's a big part of our whole leadership group, he's grown to become an outstanding preparer for a Test match and we've watched his leadership through the Highlanders and we thought he did a great job there as well, so it gives us a lot of confidence to give him that title.\\\"\\nIt will be the Highlanders star's 98th test for New Zealand and Foster said Smith has been a vital part of the All Blacks for a decade.\\nHowever the halfback almost kneecapped his own career. in 2012 he was benched ahead of a test against South Africa in Dunedin for missing a team curfew.\\nIn 2016 he was given a formal warning and stood down by New Zealand Rugby for serious misconduct after having sex with a woman in a Christchurch airport toilet before the All Blacks were due to fly to South Africa.\\nSmith has said in the past that he's learnt from those mistakes and has become a better rugby player and a better person.\\nBeauden Barrett, who starts at first-five this weekend, said Smith is the ultimate team man and a fierce competitor.\\n\\\"He's always been very energetic and that passion and desire has always been there but one thing that stands out is his internal drive is, whatever it is, it makes him tick, he's always the one out there doing the extras, he's always offering advice, he's always asking how he can get better which is inspiring.\\\"\\nBarrett's selection in place of Richie Mo'unga is one of many changes made to the All Blacks starting XV, with Jordie Barrett at fullback and David Havili at second five. There's a new front row, including the side's only debutant Ethan de Groot and a new locking duo that marks the return of Brodie Retallick. The loose forwards have all been swapped out, with Ethan Blackadder at openside.\\nBeauden Barrett has been sporting two black eyes this week and he revealed today it was Blackadder who did the damage.\\n\\\"I was warned about Ethan Blackadder when he first came into camp and found out about that pretty quick, so got to stay well clear of them at training.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto: Photosport / Andrew Cornaga\\n\\n\\nRetallick is back 18 months after last playing a test and spending a stint playing in Japan.\\n\\\"I'm a little bit nervous, to be fair,\\\" Retallick said. \\\"It's been a wee while since the 2019 World Cup, but it's been good.\\n\\\"We had the camp in Auckland, and being around the team last week preparing for a test. I am a little bit nervous, but I'm also excited to get out there and get back into the test arena, that's for sure.\\\"\\nFoster is warning his side that Fiji will be a much sterner challenge than Tonga, with their best players available.\\n\\\"A little bit of a contrast to last week. They've (Fiji) got a lot of players coming back from Europe who have been playing regularly. They've got a lot of quality players in those European competitions. They're are growing team, we saw that in 2019 during the World Cup where they really pushed Aussie and Wales I think it was. So, they can play.\\\"\\nThe Fiji born All Blacks wing Sevu Reece will start on Saturday and he revealed earlier this week that he was close to committing to his country of heritage for the 2019 World Cup, when he was contacted by then Fiji coach John McKee.\\n\\\"He gave me a call I as going to catch up with him, but we're just texting, and to be fair I was probably about 'this close' to playing for Fiji because the talent we've got here in New Zealand is just crazy.\\\"\\nWhile he's very much looking forward to sharing the field with his Fijian brothers, Reece expects the All Blacks Fijian trio of himself, prop George Bower and No.8 Hoskins Sotutu to have bullseyes on their backs.\\n\\\"I was joking to George Bower and Hoskins [Sotutu], coz those are our two other Fijians and I told them if we do get the chance to play Fiji, we'll probably be the running target around here.\\\"\\nWhile New Zealand basks in relative Covid safety, the same can't be said about Fiji, where a record 791 positive cases and three more deaths were recorded in the 24 hours before 8am Wednesday.\\nThe Fiji wing and former Crusaders star Nemani Nadolo, says they will dedicate Saturday's game to their nation as they continue to battle coronavirus.\\n\\\"We've got a lot of fuel to go out there, a lot of motivation. Our people back home in Fiji are struggling with the current epidemic.\\n\\\"Obviously we're here away from our families, the sacrifice that we've had to do to put our hands up and come and represent Fiji, so I think people don't understand the severity of what we've had to do to come here, to be quarantined.\\\"\\nIt's been 10 years since Fiji last played the All Blacks, with New Zealand winning that game 60-14.\\nSo, will fans see another one sided affair like they did last week against Tonga, or have Fiji managed to buck the trend of tier two nations and close that gap in the last decade?\",\n",

It's not the idea of it so much, more the detail.\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto: Photosport\\n\\n\\nUntil such time as the finances and infrastructure allow each team - Moana Pasifika in particular - to be truly autonomous, then the franchises will fail. Or at least be beholden to the likes of New Zealand Rugby (NZR), who have a vested interest in five other franchises.\\nBut so dismal was Tonga's 102-0 loss to the All Blacks last Saturday, that Moana Pasifika is now critical to the success of rugby in this region.\\nThe game - and by that I mean everyone associated with rugby in the South Pacific - needs there to be professional vehicles for players beyond NZR and the All Blacks.\\nFor rugby in this part of the world to flourish - and that includes in New Zealand - we need Tongan, Samoan and Fijian rugby players not to play for the All Blacks.\\nEligibility changes wouldn't hurt, but they won't sustain Pasifika rugby in the long term.\\nLetting former All Blacks play for their nation of heritage could make teams more competitive - provided they can be released by their clubs - but they won't really change anyone's fortunes.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuinn Tupaea on debut for the All Blacks in match against Tonga on 3 July. \\nPhoto: Photosport\\n\\n\\nLet's take a quick look at rugby league.\\nPlayers such as Jarome Luai and Brian To'o have been integral to the success of New South Wales in this year's State of Origin series. Both are Australian-born, but both want to play their international rugby league for Samoa.\\nThat doesn't suit everyone involved in rugby league in Australia, who believe you should only be allowed to play in State of Origin football if your intention is to appear for the Kangaroos.\\nOthers, though, recognise the changing face of the game in Australia. They realise more than 50 percent of NRL players are Pasifika and they want international rugby league to reflect that.\\nTonga are already strong, but Samoa and Fiji could be just as good. Just as importantly, Mate Ma'a Tonga have shown us that fans will follow a flourishing team.\\nThose with a view of the bigger picture realise Australia needs legitimate rivals if the international game is to rise again. If that means losing Kangaroo-eligible players to Pacific nations, then so be it.\\nOur view remains rather narrow here. We continue to stockpile rugby talent that could make Fiji, Tonga and Samoa strong, because we believe it maintains the All Blacks' pre-eminence.\\nFrankly, last Saturday's drubbing of Tonga did nothing to enhance the All Blacks' brand and nor will the anticipated thrashings of Fiji either.\\nMost of us can spot a 50-test All Black a mile off. There's just something about the way they walk and talk and look that sets them apart from your average rugby player.\\nYou assume NZR can spot those players too and yet they insist on throwing All Black caps around like confetti. We routinely pick blokes to play for New Zealand who are never going to appear more than 10 or 15 times, just so they're ineligible to play for anyone else.\\nEveryone accepts the circumstances that prevented Tonga from fielding a competitive team last week, but the biggest impediment remains the All Blacks.\\nIf you want to play professional rugby in this part of the world, then you need to declare your allegiance to New Zealand or Australia. Beyond that, any number of Pasifika players now represent Japan or England or France, because of the pathways made open to them there.\\nWe've reached a point with Samoan and Tongan and Fijian test rugby where we need to provide a different pathway; a pathway that helps those nations retain their elite players and select New Zealand and Australian-born ones too.\\nA professional Pasifika franchise - or franchises - is critical to this. Just as allowing Blues and Hurricanes and Chiefs and Highlanders and Crusaders players to represent their nation of heritage is as well.\\nAs with rugby league in Australia, there will be those who say it's not in NZR's interests to develop talent for other nations. Maybe. But you only have to look at the 102-point drubbing at Mt Smart Stadium to see why actually it is.\\nRugby league has shown us that when you give a nation such as Tonga access to their best players, they will succeed. To watch them beat New Zealand, Great Britain and Australia in recent seasons has been among the great sporting thrills of my lifetime.\\nWell, we can have this in rugby too. Perhaps to an even greater degree as well, given rugby's popularity compared to league.\\nIt's one thing for European and Japanese clubs to make it difficult for Pasifika players to appear in test rugby, but it's quite another for NZR to do the same. Particularly when rugby in New Zealand would benefit so greatly by having genuinely competitive clashes with our Pacific Island neighbours.\\nWe can't afford to wait a minute longer.\",\n",

Video / Sky SportThe football world was disgusted by a juvenile act at Wembley as England and Denmark played out a thrilling Euro 2020 semi-final.Harry Kane's goal in extra time \\u2014 scoring from the rebound after goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel saved a controversial penalty that stirred up plenty of debate \\u2014 gave England a 2-1 victory and the Three Lions will play Italy in the decider for the chance to win their first major international trophy since the 1966 World Cup.Schmeichel was Denmark's best, having an outstanding game between the posts. An incredible save to deny Raheem Sterling from close range in the first half was followed by more impressive stops as the game wore on, preventing England from getting the go-ahead goal it desperately wanted before the first 90 minutes were up.He did brilliantly to save Kane's penalty but had no chance of stopping the follow-up. Making Schmeichel's save even more remarkable is that he did it while an idiot in the crowd was trying to put him off with a laser pointer.A green mark hovered around Schmeichel's face as he stared down Kane, sparking widespread condemnation from fans watching on.Unbelievable.Someone in the crowd was pointing a laser into Schmeichel's eyes as he was trying to save the penalty Sterling dived for.Horrible look for England this.Disgraceful.#EURO2020 pic.twitter.com/LEusViVtMC\\u2014 JAKE BUCKLEY \\ud83c\\udde6\\ud83c\\uddfa (@TheMasterBucks) July 7, 2021 Former English football player turned pundit, Stan Collymore, tweeted: \\\"If anyone shone a laser pen at Schmeichel, they want banning for life.\\\"Newspaper editor Kevin McGuire wrote: \\\"CCTV everywhere so the idiot who shone a laser pen at Kasper Schmeichel during the penalty should be pictured, identified, prosecuted, jailed, shamed and banned from football for life. Dangerous idiot.\\\"Journalist Gareth Davies added: \\\"Booing the Danish national anthem. Shining a laser pen at Schmeichel as the penalty was taken. Why is that (some) England fans never miss a chance to bring shame on the country?\\\"DJ Zoe London said: \\\"Oh my god who used a laser pen on Schmeichel's eye in the penalty that's absolutely dreadful.\\\"A green mark hovered around Schmeichel's face as he stared down Kane.

I knew we would have different sorts of battles because Denmark are so underrated as a team,\\\" said Southgate.\\\"They did cause us a lot of problems, when you've waited as long as we have to get through a semi-final, the players, considering the limited international experience some of them have had, they've done an incredible job.\\\"Southgate credited Kane for keeping his nerve after having his penalty saved initially by Kasper Schmeichel.\\\"There's nobody you've rather have on it, but you're up against a great goalkeeper who he's obviously faced a lot of times \\u2014 but thankfully that's now immaterial.\\\"After falling to Croatia in extra time in the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, England made sure there was no repeat slip-up in front of almost 65,000 fans at Wembley.\\\"The most pleasing thing is that we've given our fans and our nation a fantastic night, and the journey continues on for another four days,\\\" said Southgate.\\\"To come through that sort of a night we suffered in Moscow (in the World Cup semi-final) and on a night like this we've managed to put things right.\\\"But he was quick to shift his focus to Monday morning's (NZT) final against an Italy side on a national record run of 33 matches unbeaten.\\\"We're in the final and we've got to enjoy that fact, but there's one more massive hurdle to try and conquer,\\\" Southgate said.PremiumPremiumPremiumPremium\",\n",

Beauden Barrett and Aaron Smith will once again pair up in the playmaking roles, named to start for the All Blacks against Fiji in Dunedin this weekend.The pair are among several changes to the team that put 102 points on Tonga last weekend, with Brodie Retallick, Shannon Frizell, David Havili and Hoskins Sotutu among the other inclusions in the starting squad.Retallick will be making his first appearance since the 2019 Rugby World Cup.Rookies George Bower (prop) and Ethan Blackadder (flanker) have both been given their first start after coming from the bench last weekend, while prop Ethan de Groot is in line to make his All Blacks debut from the bench.Of the players named in the starting 15, only two featured in that of a week ago - centre Rieko Ioane and winger George Bridge. Dane Coles, Samuel Whitelock, Luke Jacobson, Damian McKenzie and Will Jordan were all named in the starting side a week ago, but will make their impact from the bench this weekend.Aaron Smith will captain the side for the first time, in his 98th test.\\\"Aaron is a special player with real mana and a natural leader and his preparation is second to none. I'm sure he, his wife Teagan and his wider wh\\u0101nau will be proud of what he has achieved,\\\" All Blacks head coach Ian Foster said.On this weekend's test, Foster added: \\\"The Fijian team will bring a very different challenge from Tonga.

Video / Sky SportNot a single person in England will care but the perennial underachievers of world football have ended their major championship final drought in the most controversial of circumstances.Gareth Southgate's side will face Italy at Wembley on Monday in England's first European Championship final after a match defined by questionable refereeing decisions.In the first period of extra time, after England and Denmark finished normal time tied at 1-1, Raheem Sterling wove his way into the penalty box and went down under pressure from two defenders.England's Raheem Sterling, left, is fouled by Denmark's Mathias Jensen and a penalty is awarded. Photo /APThe referee ruled it a foul and pointed to the penalty spot, where Harry Kane had his shot blocked by Kasper Schmeichel but was first to the rebound and tucked away a game-winner that sent English fans crazy.As celebrations began, attention turned immediately to the Sterling foul, which appeared to be committed by Joakim Maehle.The reaction from some quarters was fierce.England fans celebrate outside Wembley Stadium after England qualified for the Euro 2020 final.

A semi final of a major tournament should never be decided with such a non-existent penalty #ENGDEN\\u2014 Carlo Garganese (@carlogarganese) July 7, 2021 But Sterling said the foul on him that led to England's winning goal was a \\\"clear penalty\\\".\\\"I went into the box and he stuck his right leg out, and it touched my leg so it was a clear penalty,\\\" Sterling told ITV.Kane agreed. \\\"I thought it was a penalty,\\\" said Kane. \\\"I thought I should've had a penalty in the second half as well.

Video / Sky SportEngland has broken through its semifinal ceiling at major football tournaments. A title match awaits for the first time in 55 years.Harry Kane converted the rebound after his initial penalty was saved in the 104th minute to give England a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Denmark in extra time in the European Championship semifinals today at Wembley Stadium.England will return to its national football stadium on Monday NZT to play Italy and will be competing in its first final since the 1966 World Cup. That remains England's only international title.In the intervening 55 years, the English have lost in the semifinals four times in either the World Cup or the European Championship. For that reason, this will go down as one of the most significant victories in English football history, and the celebrations demonstrated just that.Kane led the jubilant England fans in a crowd of more than 60,000 \\u2014 the biggest gathering for a sporting event in Britain since the coronavirus outbreak nearly 16 months ago \\u2014 in a rendition of \\\"Sweet Caroline.\\\" The players and management walked around the perimeter of the field, waving to fans and then their loved ones. England coach Gareth Southgate was serenaded with a song, and he would have appreciated this win more than anyone.Two of those semifinals losses \\u2014 in 1990 and 1996 \\u2014 were decided via a penalty shootout, with Southgate missing a crucial kick in one of them against Germany. And a shootout looked like where England and Denmark were headed until Raheem Sterling wriggled into the area down the right, cut inside and fell under the challenge Mattias Jensen.The contact looked minimal, and a video review was needed.England's Harry Kane, bottom, celebrates with his teammates after scoring his side's second goal. Photo / APDenmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel guessed the right way to block Kane's penalty, but the England captain reacted quickly and put the ball into the net from six yards out.Denmark's players, whose emotionally charged run to the semifinals was powered by a resolve to win the title for Christian Eriksen after his collapse on the field during the group stage, were almost on their knees by that point.And Danish hopes of an equaliser were damaged by having to play with only 10 men for the second half of extra time after Jensen was forced off injured. Denmark had already used up its six substitutes by then.England showed another side by rallying for victory after conceding a goal for the first time at Euro 2020 when Mikkel Damsgaard scored with a free kick in the 30th.Denmark's Mikkel Damsgaard, second right, celebrates after scoring his side's opening goal against England. Photo / APIt was a shot that Eriksen \\u2014 Denmark's captain who is recovering at home after suffering cardiac arrest and collapsing on the field against Finland on June 12 \\u2014 would have been proud of as his replacement in the team whipped the ball over the defensive wall and into the top corner.At that stage, Denmark was playing the better football, with its pressing and slick passing in midfield causing England problems and sparking concern among the previously boisterous home fans.Denmark wasn't ahead for long, though.Moments after Sterling was denied from point-blank range by Kasper Schmeichel, Bukayo Saka was sent free down the right by Kane's pass and the winger's low cross was bundled into the net by Denmark defender Simon Kjaer in the 39th, under pressure from Sterling. It was the 11th own-goal of Euro 2020.The second half saw England control the game, helped by the introduction of substitute Jack Grealish and the injury-enforced departure of Denmark defender Andreas Christensen.Schmeichel had to be alert to save Harry Maguire's header and Mason Mount's curling shot and the addition of six minutes of stoppage only increased the tension, with Denmark's tired players now largely retreating deeper into their own half.Unbelievable. Finally after all these years. So bloody wonderful.\\u2014 Gary Lineker \\ud83d\\udc99 (@GaryLineker) July 7, 2021 \\ud83c\\udff4\\udb40\\udc67\\udb40\\udc62\\udb40\\udc65\\udb40\\udc6e\\udb40\\udc67\\udb40\\udc7f Making history \\u2705 \\ud83c\\udff4\\udb40\\udc67\\udb40\\udc62\\udb40\\udc65\\udb40\\udc6e\\udb40\\udc67\\udb40\\udc7f National heroes \\u2705#EURO2020 | #ENG pic.twitter.com/JdrZPOba4g\\u2014 UEFA EURO 2020 (@EURO2020) July 7, 2021 - AP\",\n",

Video / Sky NewsLive updates of the Euro 2020 semifinal between England and Denmark at Wembley Stadium.After playing in two semifinals and losing both, England captain Harry Kane knows to be wary.\\\"We don't have as a good as football history as we like to believe sometimes,\\\" the striker said Tuesday.It's been 55 years since England even reached a final, winning its only World Cup title at Wembley Stadium in 1966. England is one step away from another final, however, facing Denmark in the European Championship semifinals on Wednesday.\\\"These players are making massive strides and breaking barriers all the time. We have broken barriers in this tournament and we have another opportunity to do that tomorrow,\\\" Kane said. \\\"We've never been to a European Championship final, so we can be the first.\\\"And they can do it by learning lessons from the previous semifinal setbacks \\u2014 against Croatia at the 2018 World Cup and the Netherlands in the 2019 Nations League.England coach Gareth Southgate reflected on the \\\"two very different experiences\\\" in those losses.England's Harry Maguire, right, challenges Denmark's Kasper Dolberg during the Euro 2020 semifinal. Photo / AP\\\"The Croatia, it was the furthest we've been (since Euro '96) and I think we would acknowledge we could have made changes during that game to improve the situation,\\\" Southgate said.\\\"But equally, we weren't as brave with the ball once we'd gone ahead. We went ahead so early in the game and so I think the tournament played out differently for us. Fatigue became a factor definitely in the second half. We'd had extra time in one of our matches prior to that, we'd had a very consistent team, so we are in a slightly different place in terms of the depth and strength of the squad now.\\\"In 2019, in the new UEFA competition, Southgate cited the disruption caused by Liverpool and Tottenham contesting the Champions League final just before the Nations League mini-tournament.\\\"We made errors through fatigue in extra time,\\\" Southgate said. \\\"So they were two different experiences but it's given us the understanding of preparing for those big matches and what they feel like. And I think that's part of a journey sometimes teams have to go through.\\\"At least England has avoided extra time in its five matches so far at Euro 2020. And also has not conceded a goal.\\\"We've never been to a final (as this group), so the pressure is what you choose it to be,\\\" Southgate said. \\\"I think it is a motivating thing, it is a challenge for us.\\\"If we were a country that had won five titles and had to match what had gone before I might feel differently, but we are not. Denmark have won it (in 1992), so maybe there is more pressure on Denmark to replicate that. But it is not the way we are viewing the game. We know it is about performing on the day.\\\"\",\n",

Photo / APAll the action between the British and Irish Lions and the Sharks.\\u200cThe British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa was in danger of unraveling Wednesday as the Lions confirmed a COVID-19 case among their management team barely an hour after the Springboks canceled their second warmup test against Georgia because of virus outbreaks in both those squads.The developments underlined fears raised months ago that the Lions tour would coincide with a winter surge in coronavirus infections in South Africa, which is Africa's worst-affected country. The Johannesburg region where the Lions and Springboks are currently based for the first half of the tour has been especially hard-hit by the new wave of cases.One Lions tour game this weekend against the Bulls in Pretoria had already been postponed because of yet another outbreak, this one in the Bulls team. Now, the Lions' game on Wednesday night against the Sharks in Johannesburg was in doubt after the Lions' positive test was announced less than five hours before the match was set to kick off.The Lions didn't identify the staff member who tested positive. But the result meant two players and two other staff members \\u2014 all deemed close contacts \\u2014 were also being isolated at the team hotel in Johannesburg, where the Lions have been based since arriving in the country at the start of last week.The Lions have only played one of the eight games on their tour schedule, which includes a three-test series against the world champion Springboks at the end of the tour.Wednesday night's game against South African domestic team the Sharks might still go ahead, the Lions said, depending on the results of a new batch of tests. The kickoff was delayed by an hour to give the Lions time to get those results and analyze them.\\\"We have followed all necessary precautions since the start of the tour which included regular testing and rigorous COVID-19 counter measure planning and protocols,\\\" said Lions managing director Ben Calveley. \\\"Our priority is to ensure the health and safety of the entire touring party, which is why we quickly isolated the players and staff upon receiving the news of the positive result.\\\"Everyone has subsequently been lateral flow and PCR tested,\\\" he continued. \\\"The Medical Advisory Group await the results of the PCR testing in order to make a decision on tonight's game.\\\"Shortly before the Lions' announcement, the Springboks said they had canceled their second test against Georgia scheduled for Friday night, also in Johannesburg, after at least a dozen positive virus tests among Springboks players and staff since Monday. They included head coach Jacques Nienaber.Georgia also had six positive tests in its camp, confirming outbreaks in both teams after they played the first test last Friday in Pretoria.A third Lions game next Wednesday was also in question.South Africa A and the British and Irish Lions are due to play in Cape Town next week but it's unclear if that will go ahead. It will depend on the extent of the outbreaks in both the Lions and the Springboks squads. Players for the South Africa A team will be taken from the larger Springboks squad, which is now in isolation in its team hotel.Anyone who has tested positive or deemed to be a close contact of someone who has tested positive must isolate and is not allowed to travel for at least 10 days, according to South African government guidelines.That meant that both South Africa and the Lions may have to leave players and coaching staff behind in Johannesburg when the tour moves to Cape Town next week.\\\"The enlarged Springbok squad's travel plans are now being reviewed to comply with COVID-19 protocols,\\\" SA Rugby said.\",\n",

Photo / APRoger Federer has been feted by plenty of ovations at Wimbledon's Centre Court. None quite like this one, though. This was not a celebration and didn't come at the end of the match.Instead, it delayed the beginning of what turned out to be the last game of his quarterfinal loss and felt more like a \\\"thank you\\\" or \\u2014 just in case \\u2014 a \\\"goodbye.\\\" And Federer acknowledged afterward he isn't sure whether he'll be back.The eight-time champion at the All England Club bowed out 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-0 against 14th-seeded Hubert Hurkacz of Poland today, a surprisingly lopsided finish to Federer's 22nd appearance in the tournament.Asked whether it also might have been his last appearance here, he replied: \\\"I don't know. I really don't know. I've got to regroup.\\\"As for whether retirement is an immediate possibility, he offered this: \\\"No, I hope not. ... The goal is to play, of course.\\\"Switzerland's Roger Federer wipes his face with a towel during the men's singles quarterfinals match against Poland's Hubert Hurkacz. Photo / APThat likely was on thousands of minds in the stadium when Federer stepped to the baseline to serve while trailing 5-0 in the third set: He waited while fans in the full-to-capacity stands applauded and cheered, some rising to their feet.Soon enough, it was over, only the third shutout set ceded by Federer in 429 career Grand Slam matches; both of the others came at the French Open.\\\"The last few games, obviously, you can feel that you're not coming back from it,\\\" said Federer, who spoke steadily and did not betray any emotion in his news conference. \\\"I'm not used to that kind of situation, obviously, very much. Especially not here.\\\"Hurkacz, a 24-year-old from Poland who has called Federer his idol, was asked whether he could have imagined this result.\\\"Probably not,\\\" he responded.And yet, this was not the Federer the world is used to watching. He underwent two operations on his right knee in 2020. He arrived at Wimbledon having played eight matches this season.Poland's Hubert Hurkacz celebrates after defeating Switzerland's Roger Federer during the men's singles quarterfinals. Photo / APFactor in that Federer turns 40 on Aug. 8 and maybe it was too much to ask that he make his way to the closing weekend, even if this is a tournament he's won more than any other man, and even if it's contested on a surface, grass, on which he's best.He simply never was able to summon the serving and shot-making that carried him to 20 Grand Slam titles, tied with Rafael Nadal for the men's record.\\\"I'm actually very happy I made it as far as I did here and I actually was able to play Wimbledon at the level that I did after everything I went through,\\\" said Federer, who reiterated that he has not decided whether to go to the Tokyo Olympics. \\\"Of course I would like to play (Wimbledon) again, but at my age, you're just never sure what's around the corner.\\\"Hurkacz's opponent Friday will be No. 7 Matteo Berrettini of Italy, who eliminated No. 16 Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 to reach his second major semifinal.Hurkacz never had made it beyond the third round at any Slam.In Friday's semifinal on the other half of the draw, No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic faces No. 10 Denis Shapovalov.After racing to a 5-0 lead at the outset Wednesday, Djokovic dropped three consecutive games to 48th-ranked Marton Fucsovics. Wasted five set points in the process, too. Soon enough, Djokovic righted himself, as he usually does, and beat Fucsovics 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to reach his 10th semifinal at the All England Club and 41st at a Slam.That allowed the 34-year-old from Serbia to continue his pursuit of a sixth championship at Wimbledon \\u2014 and third in a row \\u2014 along with a 20th major trophy.There's this, too: Djokovic is 19-0 at majors this season as he pursues the first calendar-year Grand Slam by a man since Rod Laver in 1969. Djokovic won the Australian Open in February and the French Open in June.\\\"I'm not chasing anybody,\\\" Djokovic said. \\\"I'm making my own path and my own journey, my own history.\\\"Shapovalov edged No. 25 Karen Khachanov of Russia 6-4, 3-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-4, then looked ahead to facing Djokovic.\\\"I do believe that I have the game to beat him,\\\" said Shapovalov, a 22-year-old left-hander from Canada.Hurkacz appeared quite comfortable on this unfamiliar stage. He played sublimely, with three times as many winners, 36, as unforced errors, 12.\\\"Obviously, I was a little bit nervous. I mean, playing against Roger in a Grand Slam quarterfinal, it's a very big thing for me,\\\" Hurkacz said. \\\"But I was trying to stay as calm as I could.\\\"Federer finally seemed to make some headway in the second set, ahead 3-0.\\\"Got to find a way to win it, somehow,\\\" Federer mused afterward.But Hurkacz conceded nothing.Undaunted by the setting, the stakes, the foe or the almost-uniformly-for-Federer fans, Hurkacz claimed four of the next fives game to pull even at 4-all, breaking along the way with a stinging forehand return of a 101 mph serve that drew a netted a backhand.In the tiebreaker \\u2014 preceded by loud chants of \\\"Let's go, Roger! Let's go!\\\" and rhythmic clapping \\u2014 it was more of the same: Hurkacz hitting his spots and Federer stumbling.\\\"Brutal,\\\" Federer said.On one foray to the net, he lost his footing and missed what could have been a simple volley.The third set went by in a blink. When Federer missed a forehand wide to close things, he packed his bags and hustled off toward the locker room with a wave and a thumbs-up.\\\"Now that that's over, you've just got to reassess everything. You've got to sit down, talk about it: What went well? What didn't go so well? Where is the body? Where is the knee? Where is the mind?\\\" said Federer, who will meet with his two coaches and other members of his team. \\\"As you can see, it was a struggle for me.\\\"\",\n",

Photo / Getty ImagesKiwi-founded alternative commentary startup Spalk has raised US$3 million ($4.3m) in a Series A round supported by a clutch of sports personalities - including Steven Adams and Greg Norman. Spalk was founded by recent Auckland University grads Ben Reynolds and Michael Prendergast in 2015. The pair landed a spot in Vodafone NZ's Xone business incubator the following year to develop their \\\"next-generation sports broadcasting\\\" startup - which syncs alternative commentary offered by bloggers and podcasters with live broadcasters.

Watching a Euro 2020 match that's only offered in English but to want to hear it with a Spanish or Hindi commentary? A Spalk partner could be able to help.Spalk can also be used to access an alternative commentary provided by an athlete or social media influencer.And official broadcasters can use Spalk as part of a cost-saving remote production effort if there are no funds for flying commentators to an event - or even perhaps a local studio.With little interest from local broadcasters, Spalk looked offshore, and it now numbers streaming services DAZN and Sports Flick among its broadcast partners, and its technology is used by sporting bodies including World Rugby, Six Nations Rugby, FIBA (the International Basketball Federation) and FIVB (the International Beach Volleyball Federation.Co-founder Reynolds says Spalk built the world's largest talent marketplace of professional commentators, providing access to pre-vetted freelancers in more than 50 languages across 30 sports.Today, Spalk has a dozen staff across a New York operations office (led by Renolds), a broadcasting hub in London and an Auckland office run by Prendergast.How did a small Kiwi startup land Greg Norman as a backer?\\\"We pitched Greg at a Shark Tank-style competition called 'Search for the Next Sports Entrepreneur' that he hosted at the University of Miami in March 2017,\\\" Reynolds says. \\\"At the time, we were exploring the US as a prospective market. Following the meeting, Greg led our seed investment round in October 2018.\\\"\\\"The CFO of the Greg Norman Company, Michael Filon, has a board seat and they have been integral to our global rollout and monetisation over the past two years.\\\"And how Adams join the party?\\\"We met Steven through Greg Norman's family office,\\\" Reynolds says.\\\"Greg and his team do a lot of work with other professional athlete family offices - mentoring, co-investing and sharing deal flow. Spalk was a great opportunity for Greg and Steven to support a company from New Zealand that is succeeding internationally.\\\"Former golfing world number one, and major winner, Greg Norman is among Spalk backers. Photo / Getty ImagesThe US$3m just raised came mainly from US backers, but Icehouse Ventures also chipped in locally.Formula E driver Mitch Evans also put money into the US$3m round. And so did Stadia Ventures, a US outfit that specialises in sports-related investments.Reynolds says Spalk is now starting to hit its marks. Revenue has tripled to US$150,000 per month over the past year, and the startup hit profit for the first time earlier this year.The new funds will go, in part, to hiring five new technical roles for Spalk's NZ office, in Parnell. It will also be used to boost marketing efforts.\\\"We do a small amount of business in New Zealand - for example, later this month we are supporting the Steven Adams Invitational for up and coming high school basketball players in New Zealand to gain exposure to US College Scouts,\\\" he says (see last year's event here).\\\"And we will be supporting with M\\u0101ori and several Pasifika Languages of commentary on the tournament.\\\"But our primary market is international with Olympic Federations and Global Sports Leagues that require multi-lingual productions - although we are definitely hoping to work with Sky, TVNZ and Spark Sport in the future.\\\"Meantime, there's plenty of overseas work to keep Spalk busy.\\\"Using our Virtual Commentary Studio, sports leagues and broadcasters no longer have to fly commentators to the stadium or studio to call games \\u2013 they can do it from a laptop anywhere in the world,\\\" Reynolds says.\\\"We are really proud to have support from Greg, Steven, Mitch and our other investors and are excited to continue leading the industry when it comes to remote commentary production and distribution.\\\"Stadia Ventures managing partner Brandon Janosky says: \\\"Remote production and personalisation of live content represent the intersection of two mega-trends in sport and we are excited to support Spalk as they disrupt this multi-billion dollar, legacy industry.\\\"\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"The injured three are Josephine Perkins (with scarf). Jonah Seeds (crutches) and Finn O'Sullivan. Photo / Rob van Dort\\\"Competing is what I do between injuries\\\" a leading British middle-distance runner purportedly said in the early 1980s.Certainly, injury is a frustrating fact of life for all in sport and all face frustration and angst during rehabilitation, especially if that period is lengthy.Injuries happen for a huge variety of reasons. Coaches are rightly concerned if there are a group of similar injuries in a training group, forcing examination of schedules and activities.Injuries can come from faulty equipment or problems at the training venue. Shortly before the Cooks Gardens track was resurfaced there was a spate of similar injuries that did not reoccur when that track was resurfaced. We all hope that when the next resurfacing is due in a couple of years that there is no delay that could risk injuring athletes and also put the hosting of major events in jeopardy.However, many injuries, especially among less experienced younger athletes, occur away from training and competition.I can remember one promising 400m runner who was not able to take his place in a championship 4 x 400m team after a Shot accident. This did not happen on a sports ground but at school when bored mates starting tossing the implement about.In 1994 leading sprinter Mark Keddell was on his way to the World Junior Championships and rolled his ankle in a fun game of football at the New Zealand Team base in Kornwestheim, Germany.We were fortunate that we had former Whanganui and Olympic physiotherapist Fiona Gutschlag with us who made immediate diagnosis and then treatment up to twice a day in the fortnight before the Championships.Keddell finished 5th in the 200m and ran an outstanding leg in the New Zealand 4 x 400 team finishing fourth at the World Junior Championships. I have often reflected what might have been without the injury interruption to his final training. Good diagnosis and medical expertise on hand is a luxury that is not so easy to find and obtain away from the high-performance sport environment.All too often younger athletes have a long wait for clear diagnosis and necessary MRI scans and expert follow-up, adding delay and frustration to their return to action.The internet has changed our lives and certainly young athletes are influenced about what they read about leading athletes and try to follow their programmes, which they are not ready for.As a young physical education student at Loughborough in Leicestershire my major study was on middle-distance training. I read extensively and was particularly interested in the training programmes of Arthur Lydiard and his group of New Zealand athletes.I became an instant disciple and went straight into attempting to run a 100 miles a week. It was not long before I was in the hands of the physiotherapist learning a valuable lesson about progression in training.Athletes in the search for success often add to prescribed training. They believe if training x is good 2x must be twice as good. I can remember one outstanding athlete in my coaching group who whenever I was away for more than a week would add additional training. I inevitably returned to an athlete with an injury.The Whanganui Collegiate cross country teams would have been stronger with the presence of three leading injured athletes. Josephine Perkins has had a series of injuries all of which have been different. I have long supported variety in sport although additional activity does carry additional injury risk.In 2020 Perkins, the 1st XI girls football goalkeeper, injured herself playing outfield just three days before last year's cross country teams challenge, the replacement for the cancelled New Zealand Schools Cross Country. This year football was the loser as Perkins broke her ankle when running in the school cross country \\u2013 double frustration.Jonah Seeds who arrived at Collegiate from Hutt Valley International Boys School (HIBS) in May ran superbly in the Karori Relays two weeks after his arrival and was added to the squad for New Zealand Schools. He too was injured playing football missing the championships.The third athlete falls into the injured away from training/competition category after he was pushed in a House cheering practice. Finn O'Sullivan had made an immediate impact in track and field on his arrival from Christchurch in February. He has now missed all of March and Term 2 and surgical intervention might be needed to get him back to athletic action. All three have suffered the frustration of not being able to train and compete and long to be back in action.Hopefully, we can look forward to an injury-free second half of 2021.\",\n",

But he is less impressed about the fate of a racetrack he has considered his second home for a long time. Anderson, who trains at Westwood Beach, south of Dunedin, has the most wins (179) as a horse trainer at Forbury Park, and as the course will cease to exist as a harness racing venue after tonight's meeting \\u2014 there will still be greyhound race meetings on July 18, 23 and 30 \\u2014 that record will exist in perpetuity.

You can understand some of the difficulties they've been facing, but I thought Harness Racing New Zealand could have helped us a bit more.\\\" Anderson hopes there will still be harness racing in Dunedin in the future, perhaps as a tenant at the Otago Racing Club's Wingatui base. He will retain fond memories of Forbury Park, the venue for nearly half his career wins. \\\"I've followed trotting since I can remember. It's a famous track, and the track itself is in great order. A lot of the drivers rate it the best winter track in the country. \\\"I drove on there the other night, and the lights were on, and I thought, what a waste to close this place down. \\\"It's also one of the best viewing tracks in the country because you can stand out in front of the old grandstand and the action is right at your face. \\\"It's a sad day in our life to see this happen.\\\" Anderson said he was only recently made aware he was the all-time leading trainer at Forbury Park after seeing a story from Otago Daily Times correspondent Jonny Turner. He is followed by Cran Dalgety (166 wins), Bruce Negus (140), Phil Williamson (115) and Amber Hoffman (113). Titan Banner, who started at Forbury Park before tasting Group 1 success, and Eamon Maguire were two of the best horses Anderson had at the course, and he enjoyed winning a 4yr-old championship with Ballindooley for \\\"a great bunch of owners\\\".

      "      \"excerpt\": \"Secure youth justice facilities are supposed to provide rehabilitation for young people guilty of crimes.\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"Secure youth justice facilities are supposed to provide rehabilitation for young people guilty of crimes. However, 75 percent of those detained haven't been sentenced, and nearly all of them are M\\u0101ori and Pasifika. Baz Macdonald looks at what's going on. Oranga Tamariki sign Source: RE: Across the country, four secure youth facilities are used to detain people under the age of 17 facing criminal charges. Another one is also under construction. Run by Oranga Tamariki, they are supposed to be for long-term rehabilitation of young people whose charges have been proven. However, a youth justice advocate says conditions inside do the opposite. Even worse, most of the residents haven't actually been found guilty of criminal charges. In Auckland and Christchurch, the facilities are on the same sites as adult prisons. They are ringed by high concrete walls and barbed wire fences. Young people follow a strict routine with chores, school and skills development under the supervision of social workers. If they act aggressively, they are moved into an isolated unit to cool off. Youth Justice advocate Tania Sawicki Mead from JustSpeak says the facilities 'are basically child prisons' that essentially put young people on a pathway to further interaction with the justice system. Each year, about 500 young people are sent to them. Right now, the youngest person detained is just 13, and the average age is 17. Most people stay for about 40 days, and the max stay through a youth court sentence is six months. But there are also young people who have committed crimes serious enough to be charged as an adult. They will be transferred to an adult correctional facility once they turn 18. Tania: 'What we know about secure youth justice facilities and prisons is that they increase the likelihood of them staying stuck in the justice system, rather than actually helping to change the conditions that lead them into the system in the first place.' \\u2018The talk is crime, crime, crime' The numbers support what Tania says. In 2019, an Oranga Tamariki report found 88 percent of young people placed in youth justice facilities reoffended in the next 12 months. A quarter of those re-offences were \\u2018against justice' - which most commonly means breaching a bail condition such as curfew. Notably, bail breaches have been identified as a significant factor in the cycle of reoffending. A 2019 report from the Office of the Children's Commissioner highlighted the issue, and found many young people said it 'sets them up to fail'. 'Cause you've broken the law', one young person said in the report, 'you get told what to do'. 'They should ask you what you think would work, \\u2018cause otherwise you won't stick to it.' Another interview with a 16-year-old said: 'In residence, the young ones learn the tricks from the older ones. The talk is crime, crime, crime.' In recent years there have also been reports on a range of issues with youth facilities, including reports of high rates of self-harm incidents and use of seclusion and restraint. Detained before being sentenced And while Oranga Tamariki says they have addressed these problems, the high number of young people detained in facilities before they've been sentenced remains an issue. Overall, 75 percent of young people are there on remand. Most commonly, this means they have been charged, but have not yet been sentenced or even found guilty - typically because they are awaiting a court date or have been placed there on a court order for further observation. 'These people haven't been sentenced, so there is a due process problem,' Tania says. Children's Commissioner judge Andrew Becroft has repeatedly criticised the practice. They were designed only for holding those whose charges had been proved, judge Becroft said previously. Despite that, in 2019, he noted secure youth facilities had become the default option for holding young people waiting to be sentenced. Additionally, some young people are also detained when they have nowhere safe to stay while going through the youth and district court system. Tania says more resources should be dedicated to community remand homes, where young people who get into trouble with the law can work with social workers while remaining connected with their school and family. 'Young people who don't have safe home environments are the most likely to get trapped in the justice system, but they need somewhere else safe and supportive to be,' she says. Currently, there are 17 remand homes in New Zealand, each with four to five beds. Tania says these have been effective, and further resources need to be put into them to ensure kids end up here instead of secure facilities, or even worse, a prison cell. Recent reporting from RNZ also looked into the issue, and found when police did not have access to a safe place for young people to go, they were placed in police cells. The Children's Commissioner and Green Party MP Golriz Ghamaran have called for an urgent repeal of the law enabling the youth court to remand children into police custody. Systemic racism: Up to 90 per cent\\u00a0M\\u0101ori and Pasifika The overrepresentation of M\\u0101ori and Pasifika in youth facilities is another significant problem. 80 to 90 percent of residents identify as M\\u0101ori and Pasifika - even higher than in adult prisons, where M\\u0101ori and Pasifika make up about two-thirds. Tania says these numbers reflect a racist system. 'We see this issue across the whole justice system, there is a deep issue of systemic racism in the people who are not given the benefit of the doubt,' she says. 'M\\u0101ori are subjected to much harsher or more skeptical lines of questioning. As opposed to young pakeha where diversions are considered first and foremost.' Oranga Tamariki: \\u2018It's improved a lot' Oranga Tamariki admits there have been problems in the past with young people being sent to secure youth justice facilities for minor offences. However, the agency's regional manager youth justice, Ben Hannifin, says this is now a rare occurrence - particularly following a ramp up of community remand homes from 5 to 17 since 2019. 'The intent of the youth justice system is to keep young people away from the escalation into facilities like residences and then as adults into correctional facilities,' Ben says. 'The more we can keep young people in their homes, or community facilities, the better the outcome.' According to Oranga Tamariki, the average first admission into a secure facility is five years after a person enters the youth justice system. 'They have been through diversions with the police, been through community services, and have also often been excluded from school for several years,' Ben says. 'Often the barrier that brings them in is an escalation of the seriousness of their offences. Very rarely do we receive a young person without a long history of interventions.' \\u2018It's a collection of needs' As to the high number of young people on remand in facilities, Ben says those decisions around length of stay are determined by judges. 'The remand time often extends because you pick up a lot of other complexities that can't be identified in a short amount of time - things like mental health, neurodisabilities or head injuries.' 'Those specialist reports take a long time, and so the judge might get those details and decide it is not time to release them to custodians,' Ben says. He also touches on the high number of M\\u0101ori and Pasifika in facilities, but stops short of discussing systemic racism. It's a 'collection of needs' like M\\u0101ori and Pasifika often living in lower socio-economic communities with higher incidence of drug and alcohol abuse, school dropout rates, and gang activity as a possible explanation, Ben says. Overall, Oranga Tamariki's youth facilities help prevent further interaction with the justice system, Ben says. 'A lot of the young kids we've got in our care, their brothers have been through it, their parents are in prison. There is a real sense of foregone-ness to some of these young people's stories. 'The intent of the youth justice system is to keep young people away from the escalation into facilities like residences and then as adults into correctional facilities.'\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Opawa residents are being reminded to stay vigilant and look out for each other in a bid to stem a spate of burglaries. The matter was discussed at a Linwood-Central-Heathcote Community Board meeting, which included informing residents on how to keep themselves and their homes safe via social media. It comes after a 31-year-old man was arrested last month on charges of burglary and assault, allegedly attacking a father and daughter while attempting to burgle their Fifield Tce home. Board chairwoman Alexandra Davids said members wanted to support the community affected by similar crimes that have happened recently. 'It's a stressful time for people, they don't really know what's around the corner,' she said. 'So we're trying to remind the community to stay vigilant, look out for one another, making sure they're locking their homes and being a bit more mindful that unfortunately, this is happening. 'There's not a lot the council can do, but having a platform to be able to remind the community to be vigilant is a great opportunity for us.' Additionally, several posts made by residents in the Opawa Neighbourhood Facebook page stated similar incidents involving robberies in recent weeks. One resident feared for her family's safety after thieves broke into their home while they were sleeping, stealing tools. Another resident said their child's bike was stolen from the property in broad daylight. As a result, the Christchurch South Community Patrol leapt into action as stated in a post made by a patrol spokesperson. 'We're always keeping an eye out in the community groups and have seen the recent posts. I've passed on relevant information to our patrol leader and we will increase the number of patrols in the area,' the post read. 'If anyone has any information on the robberies in the area, please let us know the times they have happened as well as the street, so we can better target our patrols.' Davids said Opawa was lucky to have community patrols that can pick up extra monitoring work when police resources can often be stretched. Although she was concerned about the type of incidents occurring in the area, the problem was not exclusive to Opawa, and that they often occurred in cycles. Said Davids: 'Burglaries and home invasions, whether influenced by gangs or petty crime, do seem to come in cycles and we do see some communities targeted from time to time. But you see it drop off as well when they change their locations. 'We're lucky to have those community patrols that do hover around and keep an eye out.' Police did not respond to questions from Star News, but the board is meeting with police in the coming weeks to discuss community concerns, including the burglaries, as well as 'issues around drinking in public,' and installing security cameras in public places. 'We're always there to advocate for the community and we welcome anyone to come up to us with their concerns, giving us the opportunity to speak to the right people,' Davids said. 'When people are looking out for each other, others looking to do something negative will be put off knowing everyone is banding together.'\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"If the Government's smokefree action plan does not adequately elevate nicotine vaping as the much safer alternative, then cigarette smuggling will become a bigger problem at New Zealand's border, says a leading Kiwi Tobacco Harm Reduction advocate. \\nHer comments follow a media investigation which revealed Customs is currently seizing around 125,000 smuggled cigarettes and 155 kilograms of loose tobacco every month. \\nNew Zealand Customs describes it as a lucrative market. In fact, it's thought to be eight times more profitable than cocaine \\u2013 and one which has attracted organised crime. Large scale, commercial-grade cigarette smuggling operators are now well established.\\nIt's spurred on by the fact that New Zealand has the most expensive cigarettes for legal purchase in the world.\\n'With the Government set to get even tougher on the appeal and availability of legal cigarettes, there is a concern it will only lead to more illicit cigarette smuggling. It doesn't have to be the case though, particularly if smokers are activity encouraged to switch to safer nicotine products,' says Nancy Loucas, co-director of the Aotearoa Vapers Community Advocacy (AVCA).\\nTDB Recommends NewzEngine.com\\nAssociate Health Minster Dr Ayesha Verrall is now finalising the Government's Smokefree\\u00a0Aotearoa 2025\\u00a0Action Plan after releasing a discussion document for public consultation which closed on 31 May.\\nAVCA is highly supportive of getting tough on combustible tobacco given 5,000 Kiwis continue to die every year from smoking-related illnesses. It's concerned, however, that the discussion document was light on vaping's key role in achieving smokefree. It has pushed for vaping \\u2013 the world's most effective smoking cessation tool \\u2013 to feature more in the final smokefree action plan.\\n'We've got to get more Kiwis successfully off the cancer sticks in the first place, otherwise many will head to the black market. If we can switch them from cigarettes to vaping, not only will it save countless lives, but it will put a hole in organised crime,' she says.\\nThe head of AVCA says the latest media revelation exposing the sheer scale of cigarette smuggling completely discredits recent claims by University of Otago public health experts published on 27 May.\\nTitled \\u2018Illicit tobacco trade and the Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 Goal: Arguments and Evidence', the research analysis concluded that \\u2018NZ's illicit tobacco market is small and unlikely to grow substantially.'\\n'We knew they were wrong then, but they've now been proven woefully out of touch. They argue getting tougher on legal smoking won't make much difference at the border. AVCA argues it will be an absolute nightmare for Customs, unless many more smokers are actively encouraged to switch to vaping,' says Nancy Loucas.\\nAbout AVCA\\nAVCA was formed in 2016 by vapers across New Zealand wanting their voices heard in local and central government. All members are former smokers who promote vaping to help smokers quit \\u2013 a much less harmful alternative to combustible tobacco products. AVCA does not have any affiliation or vested interest in industry \\u2013 tobacco, pharmaceutical and/or the local vaping manufacturing or retail sectors.\\nwww.avca.org.nz\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Welcome to your weekly run-down of all the big news, strange rules and interesting happenings from the world of US politics.This week, crowds of Americans packed the National Mall as fireworks exploded over the country's capital city.It was July 4, Independence Day, and a special one at that. After more than a year of horror from the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 600,000 American lives, a highly-vaccinated public was gathering together to celebrate a return to normal, according to US President Joe Biden.\\\"America is back,\\\" he said.But hanging over the\\u00a0evening was the shadow of a previous gathering.The National Mall hadn't hosted a crowd that large in almost six months, not since\\u00a0the January 6\\u00a0Capitol riot, when a\\u00a0mob of Donald Trump's supporters attempted to stop Congress from certifying Biden's electoral victory.On that day, hundreds of Americans stormed the building, sending\\u00a0politicians fleeing into barricaded rooms and causing Capitol Police to fear\\u00a0for their lives.The hunt to identify perpetrators\\u00a0is ongoing.\\u00a0The FBI has a special \\\"Capital Violence\\\" page on its website with nearly 1000 pictures and videos of 300 people allegedly involved in the break-in. They're labeled \\\"unidentified\\\".The person who planted two pipe bombs outside the offices of the Democratic and Republican national committees (a move officers suspect was designed to draw them away from Congress) is still on the run.But more than 500 people have been arrested. A few dozen have pleaded guilty, including two members of the Oath Keepers militia group who admitted to conspiring with other extremists.Only one person has been sentenced so far, an Indiana woman who pleaded guilty to unlawfully entering the Capitol \\u2014\\u00a0and subsequently\\u00a0avoided jail time. After the riot, she posted on Facebook that January 6 was the\\u00a0\\\"best day ever\\\".You probably remember Jacob Chansley, the \\\"QAnon Shaman\\\". He's in federal custody awaiting\\u00a0trial on six criminal charges.He lost a bid to be released from jail\\u00a0and is undergoing a psychological evaluation to see whether he's fit to stand trial.Congressional efforts to get to the bottom of what happened aren't progressing much faster.An effort to establish a bipartisan commission flamed out, as Senate\\u00a0Republicans used the filibuster for the first time during\\u00a0the Biden administration to shoot down a bill that had majority support.Republicans who even dared entertain the notion of further examination of the attack have been turfed out of leadership positions or are now\\u00a0facing primary contests from candidates who are raising impressive sums of money.Democrats have taken the only path left available\\u00a0and created a House select committee that will investigate the attacks, but there's much we don't know about how it will work.Will it have subpoena power? How long will it have to complete its work?Will it call former president Donald Trump to testify? If he testified, what would he even say?In the time since leaving office, the former president has moved considerably in his own views of the riots.Despite reportedly calling the rioters \\\"idiots\\\" and \\\"not our people\\\" as he watched on television on the day of the attack, he softened in March to claim there was \\\"zero threat\\\" from the people who entered the Capitol.Twice this week, Trump showed a willingness to move even further from his initial stance by asking\\u00a0\\\"Who shot Ashley Babbitt?\\\" at a rally and a press conference.As New York Magazine pointed out, Babbitt \\u2014 a former air force veteran who was radicalised by QAnon conspiracy theories and killed by police on the day of the attacks \\u2014 has become a martyr among those on the\\u00a0far right, who consider her death a sacrifice in service of a greater cause.That claim now features centrally in the strategy of a former president aiming\\u00a0to regain control of US politics ahead of the 2022 midterms \\u2026 and beyond.Today, around the US Capitol, however, some of the last fences that went up in the wake of the attacks are about to come down.The metaphorical fences erected\\u00a0between corporate America and politicians who objected to the certification of Biden's victory have come down as well, with some of the richest US companies\\u00a0turning on the donation firehoses\\u00a0again.So\\u00a0it's not just public life returning to normal as the\\u00a0pandemic winds down, but also politics, just six months after an \\\"existential crisis\\\" that \\\"shocked and saddened the nation and the world,\\\" according to Biden.The battle to define that normalcy as necessary for\\u00a0the healing of the nation, or a dangerous reframing of history, is only just beginning.Election feverNew York's long and messy mayoral primary race\\u00a0is finally over.Eric Adams has been declared the winner for the\\u00a0Democrats, and is the overwhelming favourite to take the office after the general election in November.\\u00a0He\\u00a0beat Kathryn Garcia by a narrow margin of 8,400 points, or less than one percentage point, meaning candidates may still contest the results, though no one has spoken out yet.\\u00a0The close race had the city watching the numbers fluctuate with each ballot dump, especially after\\u00a0one major ballot-counting debacle.Adams only became the clear winner after 118,000 absentee ballots went through the city's ranked choice voting system -- the first time it was employed in New York history.The race is considered the most critical measure of Democratic political opinion since the 2020 Presidential primary.US media is making a lot of Adams' background in law enforcement. New York saw a spike in shootings in the lead up to polling day (it's still so bad that Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a public emergency this week).Adams' campaign struck a balanced tone \\u2014\\u00a0advocating to rein in crime while still tackling police bias and misconduct.And that brings us to\\u00a0the key takeaway from this race: As Republicans continue to accuse their counterparts of being apathetic about crime and unsympathetic to the police, Democrats everywhere will be taking notes of Adam's successful messaging.It's still\\u2026. 2016?Russian cyberattacks against US political institutions feel too common to distinguish individually\\u00a0these days, but it's worth taking note of a pair of back-to-back hackings that happened this week.A possible breach of the Republican National Committee and the infiltration that spread to an estimated 1500 global businesses are proving a big test for President Biden.It was just three weeks ago, during his first sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin, that Biden presented a list of 16 economic sectors that, if attacked, would merit retaliation.The thing is he never really said what kind of retaliation that would be. In response to reporters' questions, he said simply \\\"he knows\\\".Biden convened a group of officials yesterday (local time) to discuss strategy, but all that's come out of it is\\u00a0a promise to deliver a message to Putin. What message? We don't know?\\u00a0So when it comes to the US-Russia relationship, it still feels like we're in the Trump era. A lot of bark, no real bite.Breaking the internetWe've known that Trump and his team have been searching for an alternative to the social media services he was booted off (and is now suing).\\u00a0RIP Parler\\u00a0and the blog-that-wasn't-a-blog.\\u00a0This week delivered the next contender to the arena, and it's going about as well as you'd expect.Gettr, which is intended to operate a lot like Twitter, chose July 4 for its splashy debut, and promised to be a \\\"marketplace of ideas\\\" with no \\\"woke tyranny\\\" and would not ban users for their views.In reality, that translated to a flood of imposter accounts, anti-conservative memes and \\u2026 Sonic the Hedgehog erotica.As the ABC's technology reporter James Purtill pointed out, Gettr ran into a problem that any\\u00a0pro-Trump social media network is going to encounter: promising not to moderate content may see\\u00a0Gettr\\u00a0booted off major app stores, but being anti-moderation is key to their product differentiation.\\u00a0Perhaps it doesn't matter. Despite Gettr being run by a former Trump aide, the former president hasn't endorsed it, which probably points to its future prospects.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Source: European Parliament\\nOn Thursday, the European Parliament adopted three resolutions on the human rights situation in Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and Iran.\\n\\nHong Kong, notably the case of Apple Daily\\nParliament condemns in the strongest terms the recent forced closure of the Apple Daily newspaper in Hong Kong, the continued freezing of its assets and the arrests of its journalists. This is yet another step by Chinese authorities to dismantle free society in Hong Kong and abolish media freedom and freedom of expression there, MEPs say.\\nThe resolution also calls on the Hong Kong authorities to stop harassing and intimidating journalists, release arbitrarily detained prisoners, and denounces any attempts to muzzle pro-democracy activists and their activities.\\nWhile urging the Chinese authorities to repeal the draconian national security law introduced last year, MEPs encourage EU countries to impose sanctions against individuals and entities responsible for serious violations of human rights and international law in Hong Kong under the EU human rights sanctions regime.\\nThey also call on the Commission, the Council and EU countries to decline invitations to government representatives and diplomats to attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics unless the Chinese Government demonstrates a verifiable improvement in the human rights situation in Hong Kong, the Xinjiang Uyghur Region, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and elsewhere in China.\\nThe text was adopted by 578 votes in favour, 29 against and 73 abstentions. For further details, the full version will be available here. (08.07.2021)\\nThe death penalty in Saudi Arabia, notably the cases of Mustafa Hashem al-Darwish and Abdullah al-Howaiti\\nMEPs strongly condemn Saudi Arabia's ongoing executions of child offenders despite its claims that it has abolished such practices. This includes the recent execution of Mustafa Hashem al-Darwish for crimes that may have occurred while he was a minor following his conviction in an unfair trial and involving a confession obtained from him under torture.\\nMembers also call on Saudi Arabia to confirm that all other child offenders in the Kingdom, such as death-row inmate Abdullah al-Howaiti, will not be executed and that \\u2018confessions' extracted under torture will be excluded from their cases.\\nWhile urging the country's authorities to genuinely abolish the death penalty for these offenders, the resolution strongly supports EU sanctions against Saudi officials responsible for grave human rights violations. All EU exports of mass surveillance technology and other dual-use items to Saudi Arabia should be suspended, say MEPs.\\nThe resolution also recalls that the Saudi Sakharov Prize laureate Raif Badawi has now been in prison for nine years and urges the EU and the international community to work towards his immediate release.\\nThe text was adopted by 661 votes in favour, 3 against and 23 abstentions. It will be available in full here (08.07.2021).\\nThe case of Dr Ahmadreza Djalali in Iran\\nParliament calls on Iran, under its newly elected President Ebrahim Raisi, to halt the imminent execution of Swedish-Iranian academic Dr Ahmadreza Djalali. He must be pardoned, released immediately and unconditionally, and be allowed to return to his family in Sweden, says the text.\\nThe resolution also calls on Iran to stop threatening Dr Djalali's family in both Sweden and Iran. The charges of other arbitrarily detained EU nationals in the country must also be immediately dropped, MEPs demand. This includes German nationals Nahid Taghavi and Jamshid Sharmahd, French nationals Benjamin Bri\\u00e8re and Fariba Adelkhah, Austrian nationals Kamran Ghaderi and Massud Mossaheb, in addition to UK nationals Morad Tahbaz, Anoosheh Ashoori, Mehran Raoof and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.\\nThe Council should consider more targeted EU sanctions against Iranian regime officials and entities involved in the arbitrary detention and sentencing to death of EU nationals, MEPs urge. The text calls on Iran to release its political prisoners, including human rights defenders, as they have been arbitrarily detained solely for exercising their fundamental rights to the freedoms of expression, belief, association, publication, peaceful assembly and media freedom.\\nFor more details, the resolution will be available in full here (08.07.2021). It was adopted by 666 votes in favour, 5 against with 16 abstentions.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"In a fierce gun battle, Haitian\\u00a0police have apprehended or killed the men they suspect assassinated President Jovenel Mo\\u00efse, and have begun hunting the masterminds of the plot.\\u00a0Two of the men arrested are believed to be Haitian-Americans and one of them is purportedly a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Port au Prince.Mr Mo\\u00efse, 53, was shot dead early on Wednesday at his home by what officials said was a squad of trained killers, pitching the poorest country in the Americas deeper into turmoil.Police chief Leon Charles said in a televised briefing on Thursday that authorities had tracked the suspected assassins to a house near the scene of the crime in Petionville, a northern suburb of the capital Port-au-Prince.The firefight lasted late into the night and six suspects were taken in custody, while three corpses were retrieved, he said.\\u00a0Other reports said seven people were killed while photos showed seven men in custody.\\\"We have the physical authors, now we are looking for the intellectual authors,\\\" Chief Charles said.A Haitian judge involved in the investigation said Mr Mo\\u00efse was shot a dozen times and his office and bedroom were ransacked, according to the Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste.It quoted Judge Carl Henry Destin as saying investigators found 5.56mm and 7.62mm cartridges between the gatehouse and inside the house.Mr Mo\\u00efses's daughter, Jomarlie Jovenel, hid in her brother's bedroom during the attack, he said, and a maid and another worker were tied up by the attackers.Mr Mo\\u00efse's wife was reportedly injured in the attack.Officials have not given a motive for the killing.Two\\u00a0Haitian-Americans were among those detained, said Haiti's Minister of Elections and Interparty Relations, Mathias Pierre.He identified one of them as James Solages, a US\\u00a0citizen of\\u00a0Haitian descent, but did not name the other.Mr Pierre would not provide additional details about Mr Solages's background.\\u00a0Mr Solages described himself as a \\\"certified diplomatic agent\\\",\\u00a0an advocate for children and budding politician on a website for a charity he established in 2019 in south Florida.\\u00a0On his bio page for the charity, Mr Solages said he previously worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti.The Canadian embassy did not immediately comment. Calls to the foundation and Mr Solages's associates at the charity either did not go through or were not answered.\\u00a0The US\\u00a0State Department said it was in regular contact with\\u00a0Haitian officials, including investigative authorities, to discuss how the US could provide assistance.A State Department spokesman, however, could not confirm if any US\\u00a0citizens were among those detained.Officials in mostly French and Creole-speaking Haiti said on Wednesday that the assassins appeared to have spoken in English and Spanish.A crowd of locals gathered on Thursday morning to watch the police operation unfold, with some setting fire to the suspects' cars and to the house where they had bunkered down. Bullets were strewn in the street.\\\"Burn them,\\\" shouted hundreds of locals gathered outside the police station where the suspects were being held.Chief Charles said locals helped police track down the suspects but he implored citizens not to take justice into their own hands.Earlier on Thursday, locals brought two corpses of suspected assassins to the Petionville police station.Power vacuumA 15-day state of emergency was declared on Wednesday to help authorities apprehend the killers.But interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said on Thursday it was time for the economy to reopen and said he had given instructions for the airport to restart operations.Since he took office in 2017, Mr Mo\\u00efse had faced mass protests against his rule \\u2014 first over corruption allegations and his management of the economy, then over his increasing grip on power.The assassination\\u00a0has generated confusion about who is the legitimate leader of the country of 11 million people, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.That does not bode well in a nation that has struggled to achieve stability since the fall of the Duvalier dynastic dictatorship in 1986, grappling with a series of coups and foreign interventions.Mr Joseph on Wednesday took charge of the situation, running the government response to the assassination, appealing to foreign governments for support, and declaring a state of emergency.A presidential vote as well as a constitutional referendum that had been slated for September\\u00a026 would go ahead as planned,\\u00a0Mr Pierre said.\\\"It [the vote]\\u00a0was not for Jovenel Mo\\u00efse as president: it was a requirement to get a more stable country, a more stable political system, so I think we will continue with that,\\\" said Mr Pierre, who added that preparations had long been underway and millions of dollars disbursed to carry out the votes.He said Mr Joseph would lead the country until then.\\u00a0The United Nations Special Envoy for Haiti on Thursday said Mr Joseph would remain the leader until the\\u00a0election was held, urging all parties to set aside their differences.A UN\\u00a0peacekeeping mission \\u2014 meant to restore order after a rebellion toppled then-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004 \\u2014 ended in 2019 with the country still in disarray.\\\"There are many unknowns about what happens next,\\\" said Jake Johnston, a senior research associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.\\\"But it is important to remember that that was also the case before the assassination of Mo\\u00efse.\\\"ABC/wires\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"JULY 9, 2021 Updated 5 hours ago Comment David Seymour pulls ahead of Judith Collins in a race to the bottom in a week of outrage sparked by $200 in\\u00a0taxpayer money. The week in news from James Elliott.\\u00a0 Our politicians like nothing more than a binge of righteous outrage to start the week. So there was no shortage of righteous politicians queuing up to dump their outrage on the steaming pile of criticism of the Human Rights Commission for gifting a $200 koha to the Mongrel Mob at a speaking event in May. 'It's an outrage!' they steamed righteously. 'And it's taxpayer money!' they shrieked in the righteous manner that only those whose salaries and expenses are fully funded by taxpayers can shriek. There's nothing quite like the inappropriate spending of taxpayer money to kick the taxpayer-funded outrage-at-the-inappropriate-spending-of-taxpayer-money machine into overdrive. Taxpayer-funded politicians strategising with taxpayer-funded press secretaries in taxpayer-funded offices crafting expressions of outrage in media releases spewing forth from taxpayer-funded printers on taxpayer-funded paper and pinging their way into the ether from taxpayer-funded email accounts while taxpayer-funded parliamentary staffers are drafting righteous questions for Question Time and other taxpayer-funded parliamentary staffers are drafting equivocating answers to those taxpayer-funded righteous questions for other taxpayer-funded politicians to read out during Question Time as presided over by the taxpayer-funded Speaker from the comfort of the Speaker's chair and its taxpayer-funded woolsack. \\nAlthough David Seymour's\\u00a0libertarian outlook probably makes him philosophically opposed to the concept of gift horses, he wasn't going to look this one in the mouth.\\n You'd be forgiven for forgetting\\u00a0there's a pandemic on, but we can at least be grateful to the epidemiologists for providing a working formula to calculate the exponential growth of taxpayer-funded outrage spending generated in response to the original $200 outrage outbreak. Take the original $200, then multiply it by a very large number of your choice - and you won't even be close. We can also be grateful for an extraordinarily prescient write-up of Outrage Monday by Jason Walls, Newstalk ZB's chief political reporter. Writing in the NZ Herald he reported that 'Although the donation was relatively small, the Opposition says it's completely unacceptable that any amount of taxpayer money was gifted to a gang.' So far so standard, but having referenced 'the Opposition' it's the next two paragraphs that elevated Jason's reportage from standard to soothsaying. He quoted ACT\\u00a0leader David Seymour's outrage and then Judith Collins' outrage, but he did so in that order, David followed by Judith. On Monday that order looked like a simple first name alphabetising of two outraged politicians, but by Thursday evening that ordering was the ranking of the Opposition, David Seymour, as the de facto leader of the Opposition and Judith Collins not. \\nBeing preferred to Judith Collins as the preferred PM doesn't necessarily mean that those who preferred you to Judith actually want you to be the PM.\\n That ranking was provided by a poll by UMR, Labour's pollster although this was not a poll for Labour, that saw David Seymour polling at 12 percent\\u00a0as preferred Prime Minister and Judith Collins at 10 percent. These preferred PM polling numbers prompted Labour's pollster (although this was not a poll for Labour) to conclude that this was 'an unprecedented result'. Labour's pollster (although this was not a poll for Labour) went on to conclude that 'David Seymour can now claim to be preferred Opposition leader', which is pretty much what you'd expect Labour's pollster (although this was not a poll for Labour) to conclude. It's also reasonable to conclude that being preferred to Judith Collins as the preferred PM doesn't necessarily mean that those who preferred you to Judith actually want you to be the PM. As far as preferences go, another interpretation of the polling is that 88 percent\\u00a0of those polled don't want David Seymour as PM and 90 percent\\u00a0don't want Judith Collins as PM, plus or minus the margin of error of 3.1 percent. Nonetheless David Seymour was quick to see the upside. Although his libertarian outlook probably makes him philosophically opposed to the concept of gift horses, he wasn't going to look this one in the mouth. \\\"People want alternatives' he said. 'My job is to put those forward, and this will serve to make me work harder in that.\\\"\\u00a0He can be forgiven for the first-person focus of his response because he was, after all, 100 percent\\u00a0of all Act MPs from 2014 to 2020. He's now 10 percent\\u00a0of the current number of Act MPs, a fun fact that will earn you both a point and the pity of your fellow team members at your next pub quiz. And you should really try to get Jason Walls on your pub quiz team because we're not done with the clairvoyance of his write-up of Outrage Monday. In quoting Judith Collins' response to the Human Rights Commission $200 koha to the Mongrel Mob and the tenure of Human Rights Commissioner Paul Hunt he sourced an incredible piece of projection by Judith about Thursday's preferred PM poll - \\\"Hunt must go whether by his own resignation or not\\\" she thundered \\\"This farce cannot continue.' Give this quote a first-person makeover and it's the perfect projection on Monday for her polling rejection on Thursday. Have a peaceful weekend. And if you're going to spend some part of it pondering whether to pick England or Italy in the Euro football final on Monday morning it might pay to see what Jason Walls is predicting.

Hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket revenue will be lost, and that must be made up by the government. Fans have also endured months of uncertainty about whether the Olympics will go ahead.\\n\\\"Many people were looking forward to watching the games at the venues, but I would like everyone to fully enjoy watching the games on TV at home,\\\" Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said after the meeting. \\\"It's gut-wrenching because many people looked forward to watching at the venues.\\\"\\nFans from abroad were banned months ago, and the new measures will mean no spectators in stadiums and arenas around Tokyo \\u2014 both indoor and outdoor venues.\\n\\nJapan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. (Photo / AP)\\nThe state of emergency begins July 12 and runs through August 22. The Olympics, which open July 23 and run through August 8, fall entirely under the emergency period, while the Paralympics open August 24.\\n\\\"Taking into consideration the impact of the Delta strain, and in order to prevent the resurgence of infections from spreading across the country, we need to step up virus-prevention measures,\\\" Suga said.\\nIn principle, the July 23 opening ceremony at the new $1.4 billion National Stadium will be without paying fans, although some dignitaries, sponsors, IOC officials and others will be allowed to attend.\\n\\\"We will have to review the situation about the dignitaries and stakeholders,\\\" organising committee President Seiko Hashimoto said of the opening ceremony.\\n\\\"No fans was a very difficult decision.\\\"\\nHashimoto acknowledged some regrets, particularly about the decision coming so late.\\n\\\"We had no choice but to arrive at the no-spectator decision,\\\" she said. \\\"We postponed and postponed, one after another. I have done some soul-searching about that.\\\"\\nThe emergency declaration made for a rude arrival for IOC President Thomas Bach, who landed Thursday in Tokyo for the games. He attended the virtual meeting on fans from his five-star hotel for IOC officials where he was self-isolating for three days.\\n\\\"What can I say? Finally we are here,\\\" Bach said, sounding upbeat as he opened the late night meeting that ended close to midnight. \\\"I have been longing for this day for more than one year.\\\"\\nToshiro Muto, the CEO of the organising committee, said many sponsors, federation officials and others would be considered to be \\\"organisers\\\" and thus would be allowed to attend venues. He said some might occupy public seating, but he said he did not know \\\"the numerical details.\\\"\\n\\nTokyo Olympics Minister Tamayo Marukawa. (Photo / AP)\\nOrganisers had expected to generate about $800 million in ticket sales. Any shortfall \\u2014 and it could be almost the entire amount \\u2014 will have to be made up by Japanese government entities.\\nJapan is officially spending $15.4 billion on the Olympics, and several government audits say it's much larger. All but $6.7 billion is public money.\\nTwo weeks ago, organisers and the IOC allowed venues to be filled to 50% of capacity, with crowds not to exceed 10,000. The state of emergency forced the late turnaround, which was always an option if infections got worse.\\nOn Thursday, Tokyo reported 896 new cases, up from 673 a week earlier. It's the 19th straight day that cases have topped the mark set seven days prior. New cases on Wednesday hit 920, the highest total since 1,010 were reported on May 13.\\nThe main focus of the emergency is a request for bars, restaurants and karaoke parlours serving alcohol to close. A ban on serving alcohol is a key step to tone down Olympics-related festivities and keep people from drinking and partying. Tokyo residents are expected to face requests to stay home and watch the games on TV.\\n\\\"How to stop people enjoying the Olympics from going out for drinks is the main issue,\\\" Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said.\\n\\nPeople wearing face masks walk past the Olympics Rings statue in Tokyo. (Photo / AP)\\nThe rise in infections also has forced the Tokyo city government to pull the Olympic torch relay off the streets, allowing it only on remote islands off the capital's coast.\\n\\\"The infections are in their expansion phase and everyone in this country must firmly understand the seriousness of it,\\\" said Dr Shigeru Omi, a top government medical adviser.\\nHe urged authorities to take tough measures quickly ahead of the Olympics, with summer vacations approaching.\\nOmi has repeatedly called for a spectator ban, calling it \\\"abnormal\\\" to stage an Olympics during a pandemic.\\nA government Covid-19 advisory panel on Wednesday expressed concerns about the resurgence of infections.\\n\\\"Two-thirds of the infections in the capital region are from Tokyo, and our concern is the spread of the infections to neighboring areas,\\\" said Ryuji Wakita, director-general of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.\\nThe Olympics are pushing ahead against most medical advice, partially because the postponement stalled the IOC's income flow. It gets almost 75 per cent from selling broadcast rights, and estimates suggest it would lose $3 billion to $4 billion if the Olympics were canceled altogether.\\nAbout 11,000 Olympians and 4400 Paralympians are expected to enter Japan, along with tens of thousands of officials, judges, administrators, sponsors, broadcasters and media. The IOC says more than 80 per cent of Olympic Village residents will be vaccinated.\\nNationwide, Japan has had about 810,000 cases and nearly 14,900 deaths. Only 15 per cent of Japanese are fully vaccinated, still low compared with 47.4 per cent in the United States and almost 50 per cent in Britain.\\n- AP\",\n",

A survivor of the Queenstown hot air balloon crash says he just hung on to the basket and tried not to get flung out.The crash injured 11 people on Friday when the basket came to a bumpy landing in Arrowtown.There were perfect winter skies for the Sunrise balloon's flight across the Lakes District, with photographer Rob Pine describing it as \\\"magical\\\".\\\"Queenstown in the wintertime. I think we got up to 7000, just glorious views.\\\"But just before 10am the landing came with a warning.\\u00a0\\\"[The pilot] just said 'this is gonna be fast troops hang on and brace yourself' basically\\\". The balloon was closing in on a paddock - and an Arrowtown home.\\\"[We] hit the ground, had a bit of a bounce or two or three and during that obviously the basket falls over, a few people fell out and we came to stop just short of a house,\\\" Pine told Newshub.\\u00a0The homeowners were unscathed but the 10 passengers and pilot sustained injuries, ranging from minor to serious.Experienced balloon pilot Carrick McLellan sustained moderate injuries and is being treated at Lakes District Hospital.The owners - Sunrise Balloons say they're deeply upset by the crash and are cooperating fully with investigators.Pine says it was purely bad luck.\\\"He just got caught out today, from where I was everything that was happening was normal he had it totally under control but you know you suddenly get a bit of wind up your bum and things sped up and that's just what resulted in us hitting the ground harder than normal and tipping us over and spreading a few people over the paddock.\\\"Pine says the crash won't put him off flying again.\\\"I'd fly with that guy any day, he's a consummate pilot, especially air balloons. The whole thing was just bad luck I suppose you can put it down to.\\\"The morning flight that promised to make memories - doing just that.\\\" I have a few crazy days but yeah that one's memorable for sure,\\\" says Pine.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Thousands of people are defying a nationwide coronavirus lockdown in Bangladesh to see Rani, a 51 centimetre-tall cow whose owners claim it is the world's smallest.The 23-month-old dwarf cow has become a media star, with scores of newspapers and television stations throwing the spotlight on the tiny bovine at a farm near Dhaka.Pictures of Rani on social media platforms have set off a tourist frenzy.Despite a nationwide transport shutdown because of record coronavirus infections and deaths, people are flocking in rickshaws to the farm in Charigram, 30 kilometres south-west of Dhaka.\\\"I have never seen anything like this in my life. Never,\\\" said Rina Begum, 30, who came from a neighbouring town.Rani is 66 centimetres long and weighs only 26 kilograms but the owners say it is 10 centimetres shorter than the smallest cow in Guinness World Records.M A\\u00a0Hasan Howlader, manager of Shikor Agro farm, used a tape measure to show dozens of onlookers how Rani dwarfs her closest rival Manikyam, a cow in the Indian state Kerala that currently holds the world record.\\\"People come long distances despite the coronavirus lockdown. Most want to take selfies with Rani,\\\" Mr Howlader told AFP, adding Guinness World Records had promised a decision in three months.\\\"More than 15,000 people have come to see Rani in the past three days alone,\\\" he said.\\\"Honestly speaking, we are tired.\\\"Guinness World Records said Manikyam, from the Vechur breed, was 61 centimetres high in June 2014.Rani is a Bhutti, or Bhutanese, cow which is prized for its meat in Bangladesh.The other Bhuttis on the farm are twice Rani's size.\\\"We did not expect such huge interest. We did not think people would leave their homes because of the worsening virus situation. But they have come here in droves,\\\" the manager said.Sajedul Islam, the government's chief vet for the region, said Rani was a product of \\\"genetic inbreeding\\\" and was unlikely to become any bigger.Mr Islam said he had told the farm to restrict the tourist influx.\\\"I told them they should not allow so many people to crowd the farm. They may carry diseases here that threaten Rani's health,\\\" he said.AFP\",\n",

Instances had been reported by people over 70 years old.\\nNinety-five per cent of the victims were women.\\nCocker said the number of people criminally charged under the Act was in line with predictions, and by and large people were now aware of the offences under the Act.\\n\\\"Not many countries have, you know, covered the breadth of offending that Netsafe now does under regulation, but it is a incredibly complicated and very imperfect system for resolving harm so there's still a lot of work to be done.\\\"\\nWhere to get help:\\n\\u2022\\u00a00800 543 354 (0800 LIFELINE) or free text 4357 (HELP) (available 24/7)\\u2022\\u00a0https://www.lifeline.org.nz/services/suicide-crisis-helpline\\u2022\\u00a0YOUTHLINE: 0800 376 633\\u2022 NEED TO TALK?

      "      \"summary\": \"Source: The Conversation \\u2013 Africa \\u2013 By Kajsa Hallberg Adu, Researcher in Higher Education and Migration, KTH Royal Institute of Technology\\nGhanaian university students hope to return home after studies abroad Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\\n\\nA great many African countries had shown steady economic growth in the decade prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. But all have failed to adequately create opportunities for the young people in their countries. With growing youth populations, creating paths for education and employment is a make or break issue for the continent.\\nBut there's also good news. Many young people are getting access to secondary education and an increasing number also university education. An increasing share of youth in Africa are university students, 9% in 2018. \\nIn today's knowledge economy, university students carry a key role in development. They are therefore an important group to study and understand better. \\nIn Ghana, a country of 31 million inhabitants, 57% of the population is under 25. In 2019, 17% were enrolled in university compared to only 9% 10 years earlier. But local scholarship opportunities are few and increasingly individuals carry the costs of tuition. Nearly a third of 15-29-year-olds are not in education, employment or training. \\nExactly how many Ghanaians emigrate each year is not known. But United Nations data on Ghanaians abroad (excluding those who have naturalised) suggest about 970,000 live abroad. Historically many have been highly educated.\\nTo understand the aspirations of this generation of Ghanaian students I conducted a study on their migration aspirations and mobility. I surveyed 467 university students in the country.\\nMy study showed that the vast majority intended to go abroad for at least one year, and most also expressed a wish to study abroad. But a majority also said that they wanted to return home.\\nThis is an important insight. The young Ghanaians I studied expressed a preference to live in their home country. The students made it clear that they were not 'opting out' by migrating, but rather making deliberate plans to be able to contribute and build at home. \\nThis doesn't detract from the fact that there are high levels of frustration at the lack of opportunity and access to basic amenities in the country. This is clear from the current protests being conducted under the banner #FixTheCountry. Most of the conveners of the protests are recent graduates, or are still at university. \\nFrustrated youth\\nMany young people across the continent with higher education degrees are more likely to consider migration than the adult population as a whole. Ghana is typical of many African countries on this front. Its number of internationally mobile students is the closest to the African average of 5.8%.\\nSince 1992, Ghana has often been cited as beacon of hope for democracy in Africa and Ghanaians have seen a steady improvement of their living standards, including access to education. But these developments have not impressed young people who struggle with high levels of unemployment, weak representation in politics, as well as underemployment in non-secure, informal jobs. To some extent, this is also true of graduates.\\nThis frustration has reached new heights. Earlier this year young people took to social media under the hashtag #FixTheCountry. More recently they have taken to the streets. The street protests were sparked by the death of an activist, Ibrahim 'Macho Kaaka' Muhammad, who was murdered on 28 June 2021. He was a vocal critic of the local government in his community. Three suspects are currently in custody.\\nTo control the protests the military was called in. Two people were killed and scores of young people were injured. #FixTheCountry organiser Kaly Jay tweeted that: \\n\\nGhanaians have lost hope in the health system, education system, security system and more. Our roads and other facilities are in deplorable states. High cost of living and a high level of unemployment. But I can't shout #FixTheCountry because my life might be in danger.\\n\\nThe views of students\\nNine out of 10 students I surveyed said they intended to go abroad for more than one year. Most also said they intended to study abroad. One in seven said they intended to work. \\nNearly all the students in the survey \\u2013 98% \\u2013 said they would want to return to Ghana, with 29% saying they wanted to return within three years, 46% within six years and around 27% wanted to divide their time between Ghana and abroad. \\nThe high level of return by highly educated Ghanaian migrants is corroborated in other studies.\\nMy study also showed that migration was not an option for some students. One in 12 students (8%) said they were not interested in migrating at all. Reservations about migration included costs such as tuition fees (53%) and racism in the destination country (16%). One in four said 'patriotism' was a reason to stay. \\nAside from asking the students about their migration aspirations, I also asked what steps they had taken towards migration. A quarter said they had not discussed migration with anyone since starting university and about half had not taken any practical steps such as acquiring a passport or applying for a visa. \\nIncreasingly difficult migration regulations also reduced migration. Only 2% of the studied population had a valid visa and 6% said their applications had been denied. Countries students had applied to were the US, the UK, Canada, Europe (Schengen), Saudi Arabia and South Africa. \\nInsights\\nThe findings of my study showed Ghanaian students who aspired to migrate also aspired to return. Young people in Ghana crave better opportunities at home including university and graduate school with scholarship opportunities, and decent work in growth sectors like agro processing and tourism. \\nWhile the authorities consider their next move on the #FixTheCountry protest they should take note of the fact that university students are not 'opting out' by migrating. Rather they are making deliberate plans to be able to contribute and build at home. Taking note of the aspirations of university students, including their wish to stay or return swiftly, is a good start at fixing the country.

      "      \"summary\": \"Central Pulse's reign as ANZ Premiership netball champions could be over after suffering an agonising three-goal defeat to Mainland Tactix. Tactix goal shoot Ellie Bird scored twice inside the final 10 seconds to pull off a thrilling 52-49 win at Te Rauparaha Arena in Porirua on Friday night, keeping their playoff hopes alive and all but ending the two-time defending champions' dream of a three-peat. Effectively needing to win each of their remaining games to break into the top-three, the Pulse led on three occasions in what will go down as one of the games of the 2021 season, but were guilty of coughing up possession via a held ball while trailing by one. The Pulse pulled level at 49-49 with less than five minutes to play after goal shoot Aliyah Dunn scored back-to-back goals, including a spectacular effort while off-balance. Taking a pass from wing attack Whitney Souness, Dunn turned away from Tactix goal keep Jane Watson and threw up a miracle shot behind her shoulder while standing on one foot. The goal went in, and Dunn scored again to set up a grandstand finish but they were penalised for holding the ball for too long while under considerable pressure from the suffocating Tactix defence. Bird made the Pulse pay, scoring three times in the final 90 seconds, including twice in the final 10 seconds, to secure a vital victory. Mainland Tactix 52 (Ellie Bird 41/44, Te Paea Selby-Rickit 11/14) Central Pulse 49 (Aliyah Dunn 35/38, Te Amo Amaru Tibble 12/18, Ivana Rowland 2/2) Quarter scores: 12-14, 27-28, 40-38 Stuff MVP points: Samon Nathan, Aliyah Dunn, Ellie Bird\",\n",

While the New Zealand TAB only has odds on surfing at the Games available currently, leading worldwide oddsmaker Pinnacle has lines for most events to be contested in Tokyo, bar most athletics competitions. It has NZ favoured to win gold in seven events, with Lisa Carrington the shortest-priced favourite of the NZ team, offering $1.36 to win the women's K1 500m canoe sprint.Sarah Hirini and Hamish Bond will carry the New Zealand flag into the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony. The three-time Olympic medal winner is also favoured to win the K1 200m for the third successive Olympics at $1.48, while the NZ women's rugby sevens team will start hot favourites at $1.39 to claim the gold that eluded them in the final in Rio 2016. READ MORE: * Lisa Carrington to chase a swag of medals at Tokyo Olympics * New Zealand rowing eights set to end big boat medal drought at Tokyo Olympics Other NZ favourites for gold are the women's rowing eight ($2.07) and women's pair of Kerri Gowler and Grace Pendergast, who are also part of the eights squad, at $2.67. America's Cup victors Peter Burling and Blair Tuke are favoured to defend their men's 49er sailing gold from Rio, paying $1.45, while the NZ men's sevens team is favoured by one cent over Fiji at $3.28. Hubbard, who will become the first openly transgender athlete to compete at an Olympics, is the second favourite in the women's 87+kg category at $6.08, well behind hot favourite Li Wenwen of China at $1.13.New Zealand's Laurel Hubbard is among the medal favourites for the women's 87+kg event at the Tokyo Olympics. The Pinnacle oddsmakers have four NZ athletes or teams on the second line of betting, while seven Kiwi teams or competitors hold third favouritism ahead of the Games starting later this month. There were no lines posted for the women's and men's shot put, which should see the NZ duo of Dame Valerie Adams and Tom Walsh in medal contention, nor for equestrian events. Following the 2016 Rio Olympics where NZ won 18 medals \\u2013 the country's best result at an Olympics and four more than the target set by High Performance Sport NZ \\u2013 the Crown Agency responsible for oversight and leadership of the sport and recreation sector, Sport NZ, set a target of 16 or more medals for Tokyo.\",\n",

In the pages of The Dominion Post today: Wellington Hospital's emergency department overcrowding at record levels A record number of patients flooding through the doors of Wellington Hospital's emergency department means people are basically being admitted to the ED because there is nowhere else for them to go. The overcrowding in the department that is normally is a clearinghouse means at least 14 surgeries have been delayed in a single week and sick people are being treated in the corridors. One Wellington emergency department nurse, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the hospital's wards were being 'hammered'. Read the story by Brittany Keogh here.

Paige has been hospitalised 12 times in 18 months with various respiratory illnesses, with a swab taken last week confirming the Lower Hutt toddler was battling respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, and viral pneumonia.

      "      \"summary\": \"A Wellington College pupil has been forced to find a new way to get to school after being bullied by a bus driver, who has refused to stop and pick him up. The boy's family made two complaints about the driver after he failed to stop, or failed to wait for the correct departure time, at the Wellington suburb of Kelburn.A Wellington College student's family says the bus driver failed to pick him up on Monday after the family made several complaints about him. The bus driver later aggressively confronted the 13-year-old, and threatened not to pick him up if the complaints continued, the family said. The boy's father approached RNZ because he felt NZ Bus, the company running the 741 bus service concerned, was not dealing with the problem appropriately, particularly in light of another RNZ story from last month in which a 10-year-old girl was dumped in an unfamiliar suburb by a NZ Bus driver, after she missed her stop at Queen Margaret College.A Wellington bus driver dumped a 10-year-old girl in an unfamiliar suburb in the pouring rain, after failing to drop her at school. READ MORE: * Wellington no longer at front of line for national public transport card as launch planned for Canterbury * Shorter symphonies could be the answer to parking limits * Wellington to temporarily suspend bus services during rush hour as driver shortages, cancellations drag on * Thousands sign petition in support of striking Wellington bus drivers The father, who wished to remain anonymous, said his son has had issues with the bus service on and off since the school year started. The bus is meant to leave his Kelburn stop at 8.19am, and the boy routinely arrives up to five minutes early. But even then, sometimes he missed the bus as it had already come and gone, sometimes leaving the stop more than 11 minutes early. \\\"Him missing the bus and being late to school was no fault of his own,\\\" his father said. \\\"It was primarily the bus arriving earlier than the scheduled arrival time, and it is my understanding that if the bus arrives early it is incumbent on the bus driver to wait at the bus stop and leave at the scheduled departure time and that has not been happening.\\\" There have also been times where the driver simply has not picked up the teenager, even though the bus has not been full. The boy's parents recently lodged complaints with Metlink on both counts, and were told that the driver had been talked to about being more reliable. But after two complaints, the driver vented his anger at the boy. \\\"There were three students waiting at the bus stop, one of which was my son. The bus driver confronted the three students asking who was responsible for the complaints, and my son said it was him. \\\"At that point the bus driver, I understand, quite aggressively expressed his displeasure, and threatened my son that if any more complaints were made against him, the bus driver, then he would not let him on the bus.\\\"Commuters on a Wellington bus (file photo). Dressed down in front of his peers, the boy felt humiliated and bullied by the driver, and unsure if he still wanted to use the bus service. His parents told Metlink about the exchange in a complaint last week. When the boy next attempted to take the bus, on Monday of this week, the driver followed through on his threat and drove straight past his stop. \\\"I'm not sure whether there was room on the bus for my son, but the bus driver made no attempt to stop and explain to my son if there wasn't any room that he couldn't uplift him,\\\" the father said. \\\"My son, however, felt that there was plenty of space for him to stand. Even though there was no sitting room, there was certainly standing room. The bus driver blew straight past.\\\" The father again complained, but he does not think NZ Bus took the complaints seriously. The driver should be taken off the route and at the very least placed onto a different route, and not allowed to continue bullying his son, he said. He took buses on alternative routes or was driven to school by his parents this week, but attempted to use the bus on route 741 on Friday morning. RNZ was there with him as he waited for the bus. The bus arrived more than five minutes early, and the boy had to run to get on it before it pulled away. The driver closed the doors as the boy was approaching and briefly started to pull away, but then stopped to let him on. He left the stop five minutes before the scheduled departure of 8.19am.The wearing of masks on public transport is currently mandatory. In a statement, Metlink's general manager Scott Gallacher said he was sorry to hear of the family's concerns, and was looking forward to a positive resolution. \\\"We cannot comment on the details of this case however as the investigation is still proceeding,\\\" Gallacher said. \\\"What I can say is that we expect all staff throughout the Metlink network to treat customers fairly and with respect. \\\"Where we discover that is not the case we raise the issue with our operators and expect them to act on maintaining high standards of behaviour.\\\" RNZ understands disciplinary action has been taken against the driver, but he continues to drive. NZ Bus said it could not comment while an investigation was underway. Meanwhile, the driver of the 741 bus this morning, as well as many other bus drivers on the route through Kelburn, were seen not wearing masks. Gallacher said wearing of a face covering is mandatory on public transport unless the person has an exemption, for example, for medical reasons.RNZ\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Lucas Armstrong used to walk their\\u200b school corridors with a lowered gaze, afraid of appearing 'different' to other students. With their\\u200b school in the midst of allegations of toxic masculine culture and sexual assault, they decided it was time for change. Armstrong and fellow student Thomas Semple, both 17, were part of a small group at Christchurch Boys' High School who formed a Queer-Straight Alliance (QSA) group last term. 'It's been a long time coming,' Semple said. READ MORE: * Christchurch girls school students seek end to abuse after revealing harassment and rape * Student praised for taking stand against 'inappropriate' behaviour by young men * Students pushing for better education around sex, consent and rape culture Semple got involved with the QSA after Christchurch Girls' High students chalked his school with messages of support for the LGBTQIA+ community and women, and more than 100 Girls' High students protested in March. He believed students needed 'better representation and support'. Armstrong, who came out as bisexual last year, said they spent much of their junior years not wanting to be part of the rainbow community because they knew it meant they were 'different' and feared being ostracised. They and Semple both felt it was difficult to change their 140-year-old school's values, but they did not want younger students to feel like they were not supported. They believed issues like homophobia and transphobia were linked to the students' treatment of women. Christchurch Girls' High students attempted to lead a sexual harassment protest against a neighbouring boys' school earlier this year, but were turned back. (Video first published May 2021). A recent survey at Girls' High revealed more than half of the 725 respondents said they had been sexually harassed, and 20 alleged they had been raped. Many incidents involved young males at social events, on the street, or on public transport. A Girls' High student involved in Culture CHCHange \\u2013 a group fighting rape culture and sexual harassment \\u2013 said the problems were not confined to one school, but they\\u200b viewed Boys' High and Christ College as 'the main problem'. The group had planned to protest at the annual Christ College and Boys' High rugby game in June, but cancelled it after being sent threatening messages by students allegedly from the schools. Armstrong and Semple decided to take action after accusations of sexual assault by students at the school were increasingly voiced by Christchurch Girls' High students. 'The culture of the school is in the boys and that's what needs to change,' Semple said. The managing director of rainbow charity InsideOUT, Tabby Besley, said groups like QSAs challenged the idea that there was 'only one way to be a man'. 'Those groups have a real power because it's about changing the school culture of that place.' There had been a rise in schools starting rainbow diversity groups over the last 10 years, often with students leading the change, she said.InsideOUT managing director Tabby Besley says QSA groups have increased in schools around New Zealand and often help make a school's culture more inclusive. (File photo) 'Well over a third of secondary schools' in New Zealand were estimated to have some form of rainbow support group, she said. A 2019 survey revealed 17 per cent of students at New Zealand secondary schools identified as part of the rainbow community. 'For every young person, their human right is for schools to be a safe space where they can be themselves, so by having a rainbow group, it shows those students that they're valued and celebrated.' Armstrong said the QSA group, which met weekly, had support from several prefects and teachers, and its events had been 'quite a success'.The students hope the QSA will continue after they leave high school. (File photo) 'The general culture of the school is accepting of the QSA but the underlying ... Christchurch Boys' High School culture still feels alienating,' they said. The group ran several events over Pride Week at the end of June, and raised more than $300 at a bingo event. A pride flag was flown next to the main flag on the school grounds, which was a big step, they said. Speeches were also given by Armstrong, Semple and fellow student Carlos Knight, who called out fellow students over unacceptable catcalling, transphobia and homophobia. 'The change we've made this year has been quite realisable,' Armstrong said. The QSA aims to create a more inclusive, accepting environment for all students at Christchurch Boys' High School. (File photo) One of their biggest focuses would be finding ways for the QSA to continue after they finished high school this year. 'Once we go, we'd still really love for it to keep going for younger generations of Boys' High boys,' Semple said. 'It's about making the school more diverse and not preparing people for the past, but actually for the future ... because the world is diverse.'\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Opinion - The All Blacks' second test of the year is kicking off on Saturday night and we'll be welcoming a new captain to the list of men that have led the side.\\nAaron Smith gets the honour in his 98th test match, which is a nice gesture but really does make you wonder what may have happened if he'd been given the job full-time.\\n\\n\\n\\nAaron Smith \\nPhoto: Photosport / Andrew Cornaga\\n\\n\\nNow, this is not a gripe at Samuel Whitelock, who has stepped in for the injured Sam Cane till presumably some time during the Rugby Championship.\\nWhitelock was the predictable choice given he'd done the job before, was likely to be on the park for the duration of all the big games, and has 123 tests worth of experience. But that's kind of the issue with the All Blacks, indeed with rugby in New Zealand right now - it's predictable.\\nIt was predictable that NZ Rugby chose Ian Foster to be the coach, it was predictable that Stewart Mitchell would be elected chairman, it was predictable that the All Blacks would hang 102 unanswered points on Tonga last weekend. It was even predictable that Foster would make 13 changes to his side from that test, because he was allowed to pick a 36-man squad.\\nThis conservative mindset isn't such a bad thing to a great many who follow rugby here and NZ Rugby knows this. But the naming of Smith as captain shows that he does indeed have the respect of the team as one of its most influential players, plus it completes a pretty remarkable redemption arc (at least in All Black terms).\\nSmith has become far more of a go to mouthpiece for the game of late, is active on social media, and would be counted as one of the most popular players among fans. But picking him as the proper stand in for Cane was just a bridge too far, it seems.\\nWhile that would have been nice, it won't make a difference to the score on Saturday night. The Fijians should pose more of a challenge than Tonga, although they have only had a few days to prepare given they've just come out of managed isolation.\\nWhat sort of crowd will be taking money out of their pockets to sit and watch that at Forsyth Barr Stadium remains to be seen and will probably be of concern to both NZ Rugby. They have known full well that it'd be a struggle to fill up the seats while also struggling to convince anyone that these games are actually doing anyone other than the All Black coaching staff any good, therefore undermining the holding of them in the first place.\\nBut at least they can count on some sort of crowd showing up, which is not an option for what was supposed to be the most notable rugby event of the year. Over in South Africa, the British & Irish Lions tour is one step away from being an absolute disaster, with a match postponed and positive Covid-19 tests in both test squads, all the while being played in front of empty stands as the country deals with another outbreak.\\nIt must be galling for the Lions players to be watching the Euro 2020 tournament and seeing 60,000 in the stands at Wembley celebrating England's semifinal win, given that relocating the tour to the UK was one of the possible work-arounds.\\nThe ramifications of the test series going pear-shaped would have an effect here, too. The Springboks are using this series as a very intense way of crash starting their programme after not playing a test since the 2019 Rugby World Cup final (they did have a hit out against Georgia last weekend, with the second test in that series called off), which means if the unthinkable happens and the test series is called off, they will come to New Zealand without any real preparation for the much-hyped 100th test match against the All Blacks.\\nThat fixture now looms as the biggest game of the year, given the Lions series may well end up being a complete damp squib. Let's just hope the old enemy gets a chance to tune up before they collide with the All Blacks on 25 September.\",\n",

If someone refuses to leave their cell, guards use it to fill the room and force them out.It has been used 27 times since 2016.\\\"The person is in excruciating pain feeling like, from head to toe, they're on fire,\\\" explains human rights lawyer Douglas Ewen. One of those times, it was even used on a prisoner who was self-harming. Guards wanted to move the man to another cell to search for anything he could harm himself with.He refused, stayed in bed, covered in blankets. Guards used Cell Buster on him twice.\\\"Pepper spray is not gassing prisoners. Pepper spray is a very well-used tool, it's designed to make sure everyone is safe,\\\" said Corrections chief custodial officer Neil Beales.Corrections say it was used twice because it had minimal effect.The man then assaulted guards when they handcuffed him. After moving him, he again attempted to assault guards, at which point they used a different form of pepper spray.Ewen is suing Corrections on behalf of Karma Cripps, an asthmatic, who was pepper-sprayed in her cell. He calls Cell Buster barbaric and wants it banned.\\\"There is a case to be made it is a weapon of torture and banned both in domestic law and international law,\\\" he says.The Human Rights Commissioner agrees.Paul Hunt told Newshub Nation Cell Buster could be a weapon of torture: \\\"I'm deeply concerned about the use of force.\\\"The Corrections Minister is refusing to ban its use - even in incidents of self harm.\\\"Without the work of the Corrections officers, that person might not be alive today. So it's not the greatest but the alternative is worse,\\\" said Kelvin Davis.The question is whether there's a better alternative to pepper-spraying suicidal inmates.Corrections is reviewing regulations about when Cell Buster should be used - but Newshub understands it won't look at banning it altogether.Where to find help and support\",\n",

It is hoped the rollout will act as a template for the rest of the country.\\nWhanganui Girls' College deputy headgirl Chloe Benadie is relieved at the news she and her classmates will soon get their first vaccine dose.\\n\\\"We're actually just quite relieved that it's happening in school and that we don't have to pay for it or go outside to other hospitals and stuff to get it done especially as a year 13 and I know a couple of the other senior year groups are feeling the same that we're going to go out into the big wide world after school and feel safe enough to travel the world.\\\"\\nChloe, along with the other students will be vaccinated from 9 August. Their kaiako and kaimahi will also be offered a shot.\\nWhanganui City College deputy principal Valerie Rooderkerk said education around the vaccine had been key.\\n\\\"We had the DHB come in and talk to a group of staff and kids of the over 16-year-olds just outlining the process and giving out pamphlets just with all of the information so they can make an informed choice about whether to get vaccinated or not.\\\"\\n\\\"One student just said to me this afternoon, 'ew I'm not getting it done, you've gotta have that thing stuck up your nose.' and I said, 'it's that's a Covid test, not a Covid vaccination.\\\"\\nRooderkerk said over 80 percent of their students were M\\u0101ori and they also host several high-needs children making the vaccination rollout even more important.\\n\\\"We're very aware that our kids are going to be out in the community with lots of vulnerable people and they need to be looking after them. That's the message we're giving that it's about whanaungatanga it's not about them. It's about everybody else.\\\"\\nWhanganui DHB communicable disease and school-based immunisation co-ordinator Bruce Jones said the biggest hurdle had been scheduling the rollout for senior students.\\n\\\"Term three is very busy for especially secondary schools and then going into term four is exams and stuff. So, with the program here we're looking at getting that finished by hopefully the end of next term so that we can be out of the schools for term four.\\\"\\nJones said clinics would be set up in schools so that students felt comfortable in their own space.\\n\\\"Some schools have school nurses, and they are great helping with the relationship and building up support for the clinics and things like that. But mainly we have a, uh, a team of public health nurses and the district health board has a great team of vaccinators and will be working with him as well.\\\"\\nJodie Bunker is the executive officer of a special school in Whanganui where students today received their second Pfizer vaccine.\\n\\\"It'll be a relief when it's done because obviously it's been a long time coming and there's a lot of uncertainty still kind of going around and I think getting it done has kind of helped with a lot of that uncertainty, and just not having to worry about it.\\\"\\nThe city's rollout for senior students will provide a template for the 12 to 15-year-old group once Medsafe has approved Pfizer for use in that cohort and more vaccines become available.\\nh] Related\",\n",

Read on as a-league.com.au\\u00a0looks back on ten of the most memorable fixtures served up throughout 24 entertaining Matchweeks in the 2020/21 A-League campaign! Matchweek 19: Western Sydney Wanderers 3-2 Sydney FC \\\"It's a famous night at Bankwest. Scott McDonald on his debut with what proves the match-winner. A five-goal thriller to resurrect the Wanderers' finals hopes.\\\" A berth in the\\u00a0Finals Series wasn't to eventuate for Western Sydney by the end of 2020/21, much to the disappointment of a club with high expectations heading into the season. But in Matchweek 19,\\u00a0Wanderers fans dared to dream after a 3-2 Sydney Derby triumph in front of a vibrant crowd packed into Bankwest Stadium. More than 20,000 fans filled the stands to watch the home side try and stop the rot, having gone six games without a win heading into the clash with Sydney FC. The Sky Blues\\u00a0hadn't lost for six games heading into the Sydney Derby, and they wouldn't lose for seven more in the games that followed. But on the first night of May, the Wanderers served up a performance to remember to extend their unbeaten run against the Sky Blues to six games.\\u00a0 The five-goal contest\\u00a0saw the brilliant Bruce Kamau open the scoring, before the Duke of Parramatta doubled the advantage. Alex Wilkinson found a rare goal early in the second half for the Sky Blues, but Scott McDonald made it 3-1 down the other end just minutes after emerging from the bench in his first appearance for the Red and Black.\\u00a0 Trent Buhagiar won the visitors a penalty in the 83rd minute, which Bob\\u00f4 blasted high over the bar - much to the delight of the home fans. A manic finish was to follow, as Anthony Caceres combined with Milo\\u0161 Ninkovi\\u0107 to burst into the box and tee Bob\\u00f4 up to find his 50th goal in A-League history\\u00a0from close range. Caceres thundered a late shot from outside the box off the crossbar as the Sky Blues tried desperately to salvage a point, but it was too little, too late for the eventual Grand Finalists as the Wanderers won out on a memorable night at Bankwest Stadium. Western Sydney Wanderers 3-2 Sydney FC | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 22: Wellington Phoenix 3-0 Western United \\\"There's no place like home for the Wellington Phoenix... Lewis, Piscopo and Hemed all on the scoresheet. 24,000-plus delirious fans,\\u00a0Wellington Phoenix three, Western United nil.\\\" 433 days after the last playing\\u00a0on home soil, Wellington Phoenix returned to Sky Stadium to beat\\u00a0Western United 3-0 in front of a record-breaking crowd at Sky Stadium in Matchweek 22. Wellington's biggest-ever home crowd for a regular season fixture flocked to see their side in the flesh for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic saw the 'Nix base themselves in New South Wales to ensure both the 2019/20 and 2020/21 A-League campaigns could go ahead.\\u00a0 The sacrifices made by the New Zealand outfit produced plenty of challenges and hardships throughout the season. It's what made their return across the ditch even sweeter when a travel bubble between the two A-League countries allowed the Phoenix to arrange two\\u00a0fixtures to be held in Wellington and Aukland before the end of the 2020/21 campaign. The first of which came\\u00a0at Sky Stadium, and the performance of the home side combined with the passion pouring out of an\\u00a0emotionally-charged crowd made for an unforgettable occasion in Wellington. Clayton Lewis, Reno Piscopo and Tomer Hemed were the scorers for the Phoenix on that special day in May. Wellington Phoenix 3-0 Western United | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 18: Central Coast Mariners 2-2 Sydney FC \\\"The points are split on a pulsating night on the Central Coast.\\\" Second on the table and gunning to remain in the hunt for the Premiers Plate, Central Coast Mariners hosted the surging\\u00a0Sky Blues in front of the biggest home crowd pulled by the Gosford side throughout the regular season.\\u00a0 It seemed the Mariners faithful were in for a treat when goals to Marco Ure\\u00f1a and Matt Simon scored to put the home side two goals up in the first half, before Sydney put on a comeback effort inspired by Ninkovi\\u0107's inventive volley scored off the outside of his right foot in the dying embers of the first half.\\u00a0 The Sky Blues saw a second-half equaliser ruled out by VAR, and Andrew Redmayne denied Ure\\u00f1a a sealer down the other end with a strong save soon after before Buhagiar got Sydney back on level terms with less than ten minutes to play. After the game Alen Stajcic said it was the most alive he's felt at an A-League ground throughout his two-year stint as head coach of the Mariners, as he and the 10,000-strong crowd were treated to a classic encounter between two teams desperate for points.\\u00a0 Central Coast Mariners 2-2 Sydney FC | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 10: Melbourne Victory 3-4 Western United \\\"A chance here to win it - SANCHEZ...\\u00a0Western United do claim the three points in the final seconds!\\\" The ultimate display of last-gasp drama occurred in Matchweek 10 when Western United pipped Melbourne Victory to the post in an intense instalment of the Battle of the Bridge at Marvel Stadium. Victor S\\u00e1nchez scored three goals throughout 2020/21 for Western United. Two of those strikes\\u00a0came on February 27 against Victory, with the second rippling the back of the net in the sixth minute of additional time to grant the Green and Black a 4-3 win. S\\u00e1nchez had scored the goal to take the two sides into the half-time break level at 1-1 after Callum McManaman's opener\\u00a0for Victory. United then pulled ahead through a quick-fire Besart Berisha brace in the second stanza. Up 3-1 and cruising, United conceded to Jacob Butterfield before Tomislav Uskok earned a second booking for the half to reduce his side to ten men for the final half-hour of play. Rudy Gestede netted a towering header in the 82nd minute to draw Victory level and send the home fans wild - but instead of watching their side go\\u00a0on to clinch all three points, the Victory faithful were to watch it all fall apart down the other end as S\\u00e1nchez popped up in the right place at the right time to score the ultimate heartbreaker.\\u00a0 Melbourne Victory 3-4 Western United | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 17: Melbourne City 7-0 Melbourne Victory \\\"An historic night, the 34th Melbourne Derby sees Jamie Maclaren score five... It's elation for City and humiliation for the Victory, who cop seven for the first time in A-League history.\\\" In the moments before kick-off in Matchweek 17's Melbourne Derby, Melbourne City fans held aloft signs displaying the number '6' to remind their opponents, Melbourne Victory, of City's 6-0 romp in the same fixture earlier in the 2020/21 campaign. Little did they know their side were about to go one better on an unforgettable night at AAMI Park. The contest was all but over by half-time after Andrew Nabbout and Jamie Maclaren scored on either side of Victory defender Adama Traor\\u00e9's straight red card on 30 minutes. But after the break City put on a relentless display, with Maclaren bagging four more and Adri\\u00e1n Luna putting the icing on the cake of a 7-0 rout.\\u00a0 City's combined score of 13 goals to nil against Victory across the first two Melbourne Derby fixtures in 2020/21 signalled a seismic shift in Victoria as City went on to claim the Premiership/Championship double and Victory slumped to a club-first wooden spoon. Melbourne City 7-0 Melbourne Victory | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 7: Central Coast Mariners 3-2 Western United \\\"Burgess was casual, Nigro took it off him, Bouman looking immediately for KUOL... can you believe it? It's 3-2, he's got a brace off the bench, and it's 3-2 to Central Coast, on top turning it around again!\\\" Mariners young gun\\u00a0Alou Kuol was an unstoppable force in the early stages of the 2020/21 campaign, as the teenage sensation scored six of his seven goals in his first nine appearances. In Matchweek 7 Kuol's impact was as lethal as ever, as he emerged from the bench to haul the Mariners back from the brink in a magnificent comeback win over Western United.\\u00a0 It was the second time in as many games the Mariners were to secure a comeback 3-2 win. With the score at 2-1 in United's favour, Stajcic introduced Kuol to the action with 30 minutes to play. His first goal drew the Mariners level at 2-2 before the energetic forward caused scenes of elation in the stands at Central Coast Stadium with an emphatic headed finish to Daniel Bouman's cross, sealing a 3-2 win for his red-hot side.\\u00a0 Central Coast Mariners 3-2 Western United | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 5: Western United 5-4 Perth Glory \\\"That is the end, the end of an extraordinary game of A-League football.\\u00a0It will go down as a classic. Western United with their first win of the season over a gallant Perth Glory.\\\" After emerging 5-3 victors in their first game of the campaign, Perth Glory travelled to face Western United in Matchweek 5 eager to keep the goalscoring momentum rolling.\\u00a0 The Western Australian side managed exactly that, scoring four more against United. But\\u00a0the defensive cracks remained, got bigger, and ultimately cost Richard Garcia's side the points in a manic 5-4 defeat.\\u00a0 United boss Mark Rudan admitted post-match he turned to Garcia during the game to say \\\"this is crazy\\\" as the two coaches shared a laugh as the mayhem unfolded.\\u00a0 There was only one goal scored in the first 56 minutes of play, through United's Victor S\\u00e1nchez, before chaos ensued in the final half-hour. Carlo Armiento and Bruno Fornaroli scored to put Perth 2-1 up, then Dylan Pieras netted a four-minute double off the bench to wrestle momentum back in United's favour. Nicholas D'Agostino levelled it up at 3-3, then Tomoki Imai and Armiento exchanged blows to take it to 4-4 at the 78-minute mark. Steven Lustica was the match-winner in the end, scoring the ninth goal of the game in the 84th minute as United won out 5-4. Western United 5-4 Perth Glory | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek\\u00a012: Western Sydney Wanderers 4-3 Wellington Phoenix \\\"What an amazing game of football at Bankwest Stadium.\\\" A seven-goal spectacle capped off by a pair of goals of the highest order unfolded at Bankwest Stadium in Matchweek 12 as Western Sydney outlasted the Phoenix in a 4-3 affair.\\u00a0 The two sides took to Bankwest Stadium on a Monday evening in March to serve up one of the games of the season which will be forever remembered for Cameron Devlin's thunderous strike for Wellington and Mitchell Duke's chest and volley down the other end which won Goal of Matchweek 12 honours. The Phoenix pulled ahead on three occasions in the contest, but the Wanderers found the answer on every occasion. With the score locked at 3-3 after 66 minutes of play the away side ran out of ways to try and kill off the resilient Red and Black, leaving the hosts to capitalise on their ability to find an answer to every question posed of them to find the decisive finish through Kwame Yeboah in the 84th minute, winning out 4-3 at Bankwest Stadium. Western Sydney Wanderers 4-3 Wellington Phoenix | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 15: Welllington Phoenix 2-3 Melbourne City \\\"A beautiful header from Marco Tilio, off the bench to put City back in front.\\u00a0Wonderfully created, superbly executed, and Melbourne City lead 3-2.\\\" Marco Tilio's match-winning display in Melbourne City's 3-2 win over Wellington Phoenix in Matchweek 15 was the moment that sparked the creative teenager's end-of-season form and stirring run toward playing a key role in City's Championship push. Tilio was\\u00a0given just 206 minutes of playing time in his first 12 games of the season as an\\u00a0attack fronted by star man Maclaren dominated the league. But the tide began to turn for Tilio after the 19-year-old scored three minutes into his cameo off the bench against Wellington in Matchweek 15 to decide a see-sawing contest in his side's favour. City twice took the lead throughout the game, and Wellington twice found the leveller as both Hemed and D\\u00e1vila scored equalising goals at WIN\\u00a0Stadium, Wellington's home away from home in Wollongong.\\u00a0 But the all-important fifth goal was to come off Tilio's head, assisted by a cross whipped in by Scott Galloway after Stefan Colakovski - who would also see his minutes increase in the latter stages of the season - set up the chance with tenacious play down the right-hand side of City's attack. Wellington Phoenix 2-3 Melbourne City | Match Highlights | A-LeagueMatchweek 23: Wellington Phoenix 2-2 Perth Glory \\\"An absolute thriller at Eden Park ends in a stalemate...an absolutely scintillating encounter in the A-League. Both sides desperate for three points, both have to be content in a share. \\\" Wellington's late push for a spot\\u00a0in\\u00a0the\\u00a02020/21 Finals Series ultimately hinged on a missed penalty from captain D\\u00e1vila in the 90th minute of a thrilling 2-2 draw in the second of two Phoenix matches in New Zealand to end the season. Instead of clinching all three points at Eden Park, the 'Nix had to settle for a share of the spoils. Wellington went on to fall just one point short of a spot in the post-season after a win over Macarthur FC on the final day of the season.\\u00a0 But before D\\u00e1vila's penalty miss in minute 90, an enthralling contest between two evenly-matched sides played out in front of 22,233 fans in Aukland. Wellington took the lead through Tomer Hemed in the first half, then\\u00a0the away side turned it all around after the break. Bruno Fornaroli netted the equaliser, leaving Callum Timmins to blast Perth ahead with one of the goals of the season dispatched\\u00a0from distance into the top-right corner. Jaushua Sotirio came off the bench to make his mark with an 80th minute equaliser, leaving D\\u00e1vila with the opportunity to be the hero after Nick D'Agostino bundled Devlin over in the box.\\u00a0 It was an opportunity missed by D\\u00e1vila - a \\\"what if?\\\" moment in a brave campaign\\u00a0by the New Zealand outfit.

      "      \"summary\": \"Western Australia is threatening to tighten restrictions for coronavirus-plagued NSW even further, including potentially reducing compassionate exemptions.Premier Mark McGowan says strengthening the border could be necessary after NSW endured the worst day of its current outbreak, recording 44 new cases.WA's recent four-day lockdown was traced to a woman who contracted the highly transmissible Delta variant while holidaying in Sydney.\\\"We can't forget what we've been through here over the past fortnight has a direct link to the Bondi outbreak,\\\" Mr McGowan told reporters on Friday.\\\"Each day it looks like the situation in Sydney is increasingly dire.\\\"Of course our thoughts are with everyone in Sydney ... but the risk from this recent outbreak is all too dangerous.\\\"NSW is currently classed by WA as a medium-risk jurisdiction, denying entry to anyone who cannot secure highly-restricted exemptions.Mr McGowan - whose parents live in Sydney - said officials would review the border arrangements to see if they could be further tightened, including exemptions on compassionate grounds.\\\"Ordinarily it's returning West Australians coming home who might have gone to NSW for a short period of time,\\\" he said.\\\"If that particular category had to be tightened further in the circumstances we face, that's what we'd look at doing.\\\"WA recorded no new cases on Friday.Perth and the Peel region are slated to return to pre-lockdown life at 1201am on Monday, removing all existing restrictions.More than 15,400 small businesses affected by the lockdown will be eligible for $3000 grants.About 2300 tourism and hospitality businesses in regional WA who missed out on visitors just prior to the school holidays can also apply.The Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA had called for grants of up to $6000.\\\"On a per-day basis of lockdown, (the grants are) more generous than those put in place in NSW, Victoria and Queensland,\\\" Mr McGowan said.The premier said 55 people who attended Geraldton Hospital at the same time as an infected ship crewman were now classed as casual contacts.Of those, 46 have so far returned negative tests.Genomic testing has revealed the crewman, who spent up to three hours in the emergency department before being moved to a negative pressure room, has the Delta variant.The man in his 50s was airlifted to Perth and remains in a stable condition in intensive care at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.Staff, patients and visitors in the ED were initially told they would not have to isolate.That decision was reversed on Thursday following a meeting between government and health officials, despite the premier describing the risk of transmission as \\\"minuscule\\\".Upon returning a negative test, staff members will be allowed to return to work but must wear face masks at all times.Mr McGowan said the crewman \\\"probably would have died\\\" if his ship, which has since departed, hadn't been allowed to unload him for treatment at Geraldton.He was hospitalised in Geraldton, 420km north of Perth, after falling ill while aboard an empty bulk carrier over the weekend.The MV Emerald Indah has since departed for Indonesia after being blocked from docking near Perth.A separate staff member at the hospital is required to quarantine for 14 days after entering a lift used by the infected crewman.Authorities say the vaccinated staff member was sent home to isolate immediately and didn't have any contact with the community.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"A wave of brazen attacks has turned cyber risk into a barbecue stopper.Federal parliament's intelligence and security committee is considering tougher cyber laws that could give enforcement and intelligence agencies greater powers to reach into private firms.Former US cyber chief Chris Krebs said it was important the public recognise the online threat after decades of subtle and covert intelligence action.Ransomware operator REvil, which is behind the latest mass attack, has infiltrated more than 300 businesses in Australia after hitting meat processor JBS Foods.\\\"When we have these brazen acts, it finally brings it home here in the US but also in Australia,\\\" Mr Krebs told the committee on Friday.\\\"When your hamburgers and hotdogs have been taken off the shelves that makes it really resonate.\\\"The Russian-linked cyber criminals are demanding a record ransom of $94 million to \\\"unlock\\\" more than 1000 victims in Australia and overseas.Mr Krebs also warned Australia's critical infrastructure was at risk from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.Representatives from companies ranging from Ramsay Healthcare to Optus said they had a good relationship with federal cyber experts under the existing legal regime, where much information is shared informally.Confusion remains about how the proposed laws would work in practice as regulations are yet to be written and definitions are broad.Universities don't want whole campuses defined as critical infrastructure, as cafeterias don't need the same protection as supercomputers.Australian Food and Grocery Council spokesman Geoffrey Annison said his industry was resilient, as proven during lockdowns, when it met unprecedented demand for toilet paper during the pandemic.But systems supporting supply chains were at risk, as seen during the 2018 storms that knocked out power in South Australia and shut down supermarket check-outs.Maritime Union national secretary Paddy Crumlin voiced concern shipping lanes and vessels full of oil and gas or fertiliser were not included as critical infrastructure in the proposed legislation.\\\"Much of the shipping is controlled by China, because they're our major trading partner,\\\" he said.Gary Smith from Optus was worried there had been \\\"radio silence\\\" on the space sector.Cyber security expert Rachel Falk said some companies were switched on to the threat, but warned those running old systems were vulnerable, particularly to ransomware.She said adversaries could sit and wait for a long time before flicking the switch.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Crown Resorts has claimed it could default on hefty debts impacting thousands of innocent employees if its Melbourne licence is not renewed.The company's Victorian operation, under the microscope of a royal commission into whether it can retain a licence, wrote a letter to the state government last week requesting a meeting to discuss its commercial affairs.In hearings just a day earlier, the gaming giant's executive chair Helen Coonan was grilled about the July 2 letter from Crown's external lawyer Arnold Bloch Leibler to Consumer Affairs, Gaming and Liquor Regulation Minister Melissa Horne.Commissioner Ray Finkelstein said a \\\"plain English\\\" reading of the letter was that Crown was seeking to \\\"make sure that the commission doesn't make a particular finding\\\".Ms Coonan denied the company was trying to pre-empt or interfere with the royal commission.A redacted version of the letter made public on Friday revealed the gaming giant had told Ms Horne of the \\\"consequences for Crown and stakeholders\\\" that would arise from a negative outcome of the commission.\\\"It is not in the public interest for Crown to fail,\\\" the letter written by law firm partner Leon Zwier said.Crown is the state's largest single-site private employer with just under 12,000 employees, most of whom have not contributed to the failures of the company, it said.\\\"Through COVID-10 (employees) have suffered significant uncertainties. They will suffer greater uncertainties if there is an EOD (event of default).\\\"An EOD may also provide potential overseas suitors an opportunity to take advantage of the situation.\\\"Crown told the minister that a negative finding against it could result in defaulting on debts worth $700 million.This would have \\\"severe consequences\\\" for Crown and all its stakeholders, the company said, including shareholders, employees, unions, trade creditors, patrons and the hotel precinct and Melbourne tourism industry.Crown Resorts has received takeover offers from The Star entertainment group, which owns venues in Sydney, the Gold Coast and Brisbane, as well as US private investment firms Oaktree Capital and the Blackstone Group.Any suitor will want a guarantee that Crown's casino licence is not suspended, the letter stated.The company told the consumer affairs minister that it acknowledged the commission's role in \\\"shedding light on prior failures of culture, systems and people\\\" so that such failings are not repeated.It said it would consider terminating employment of any executives or employees that the royal commission makes adverse findings against.Friday marks the final day of eight weeks of hearings into the casino operator, in which more than 60 witnesses have given evidence.The hearings have covered failings and lack of compliance of the Melbourne casino, including that only 12 staff were employed to ensure an estimated 64,000 daily visitors gambled responsibly.It also emerged that Crown had underpaid gaming taxes by the millions, though two letters made public by the commission on Friday stated Crown had underpaid by $8.8 million - not $272.6 million as previously reported.\\\"It is Crown's intention to pay our estimation of the amount owing, together with penalty interest,\\\" chief executive officer Steve McCann wrote to both the gaming regulator and the Department of Treasury and Finance on July 1.Commissioner Ray Finkelstein is expected to deliver a final report detailing his findings and recommendations by October 15.His inquiry centred on Crown's Melbourne operations follows the Bergin inquiry in NSW, which in February found Crown unfit to run a casino at its Barangaroo complex in Sydney.Separately, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation (VCGLR) on Friday confirmed that an independent investigation will examine serious criminal allegations at Melbourne's Crown Casino.The allegations, made by former inspectors of the casino, will be investigated by prominent QC Ian Freckelton.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"A wave of brazen attacks has turned cyber risk into a barbecue stopper.Federal parliament's intelligence and security committee is considering tougher cyber laws that could give enforcement and intelligence agencies greater powers to reach into private firms.Former US cyber chief Chris Krebs said it was important the public recognise the online threat after decades of subtle and covert intelligence action.Ransomware operator REvil, which is behind the latest mass attack, has infiltrated more than 300 businesses in Australia after hitting meat processor JBS Foods.\\\"When we have these brazen acts, it finally brings it home here in the US but also in Australia,\\\" Mr Krebs told the committee on Friday.\\\"When your hamburgers and hotdogs have been taken off the shelves that makes it really resonate.\\\"The Russian-linked cyber criminals are demanding a record ransom of $94 million to \\\"unlock\\\" more than 1000 victims in Australia and overseas.Mr Krebs also warned Australia's critical infrastructure was at risk from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.Representatives from companies ranging from Ramsay Healthcare to Optus said they had a good relationship with federal cyber experts under the existing legal regime, where much information is shared informally.Confusion remains about how the proposed laws would work in practice as regulations are yet to be written and definitions are broad.Universities don't want whole campuses defined as critical infrastructure, as cafeterias don't need the same protection as supercomputers.Australian Food and Grocery Council spokesman Geoffrey Annison said his industry was resilient, as proven during lockdowns, when it met unprecedented demand for toilet paper during the pandemic.But systems supporting supply chains were at risk, as seen during the 2018 storms that knocked out power in South Australia and shut down supermarket check-outs.Maritime Union national secretary Paddy Crumlin voiced concern shipping lanes and vessels full of oil and gas or fertiliser were not included as critical infrastructure in the proposed legislation.\\\"Much of the shipping is controlled by China, because they're our major trading partner,\\\" he said.Gary Smith from Optus was worried there had been \\\"radio silence\\\" on the space sector.Cyber security expert Rachel Falk said some companies were switched on to the threat, but warned those running old systems were vulnerable, particularly to ransomware.She said adversaries could sit and wait for a long time before flicking the switch.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"West Coast defender Jeremy McGovern says every player in the team has put their hand up to take responsibility for last week's humiliating loss to Sydney, but insists the club isn't in crisis mode.The Eagles have been publicly battered since they followed up a home 55-point loss to the Bulldogs with a 92-point shellacking at the hands of the Swans last week.The defeats have all but killed off West Coast's chances of snaring a top-four berth, making it highly unlikely they'll be a legitimate premiership threat come finals time.McGovern revealed the player group sat down this week for a heart-to-heart chat in which every player owned up to letting the team down.\\\"All the boys put their hands up who haven't performed, and everyone did,\\\" McGovern said.\\\"There wasn't one bloke in there who put their hand up and said 'I've been 100 per cent all year'.\\\"We don't really need to get the sledgehammer out and whack blokes.\\\"But we sit down and we educate. We talk about it. We own up to it. That was probably the first thing.\\\"McGovern said there was still plenty of belief within the squad and not all was lost given West Coast are still inside the top eight.\\\"It's definitely not crisis talks or alarm bells going off completely,\\\" McGovern said.\\\"But we had to have a few chats to a few boys and we all had to look at each other individually.\\\"I'm obviously a leader of the footy club as well, so I'll put my hand up. I've had efforts and parts in games that I haven't contributed.\\\"West Coast will be aiming to rebound when they take on wooden spoon favourites North Melbourne at Optus Stadium on Monday night.McGovern said rather than make wholesale changes to the game plan, the playing group is determined to display a better work rate and also speed up their ball movement.\\\"It's pretty hard to fully reinvent your game plan at this part of the year,\\\" he said.\\\"We've had to tweak a few things, look at a few things. But it's not reinvent the whole wheel.\\\"The Eagles will be boosted by the return of Andrew Gaff (thumb) and Liam Ryan (suspension).But defender Alex Witherden appears set for another long stint on the sidelines after his groin injury flared up.Witherden missed almost two months earlier this season with what the club thought was the early stages of osteitis pubis, and the issue will be investigated further before a timeline is set on his return.Midfielder Jack Redden is set to miss two to three weeks with a minor leg fracture, while forward Jamaine Jones (syndesmosis) has been ruled out for six weeks.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Crown Resorts has claimed it could default on hefty debts impacting thousands of innocent employees if its Melbourne licence is not renewed.The company's Victorian operation, under the microscope of a royal commission into whether it can retain a licence, wrote a letter to the state government last week requesting a meeting to discuss its commercial affairs.In hearings just a day earlier, the gaming giant's executive chair Helen Coonan was grilled about the July 2 letter from Crown's external lawyer Arnold Bloch Leibler to Consumer Affairs, Gaming and Liquor Regulation Minister Melissa Horne.Commissioner Ray Finkelstein said a \\\"plain English\\\" reading of the letter was that Crown was seeking to \\\"make sure that the commission doesn't make a particular finding\\\".Ms Coonan denied the company was trying to pre-empt or interfere with the royal commission.A redacted version of the letter made public on Friday revealed the gaming giant had told Ms Horne of the \\\"consequences for Crown and stakeholders\\\" that would arise from a negative outcome of the commission.\\\"It is not in the public interest for Crown to fail,\\\" the letter written by law firm partner Leon Zwier said.Crown is the state's largest single-site private employer with just under 12,000 employees, most of whom have not contributed to the failures of the company, it said.\\\"Through COVID-10 (employees) have suffered significant uncertainties. They will suffer greater uncertainties if there is an EOD (event of default).\\\"An EOD may also provide potential overseas suitors an opportunity to take advantage of the situation.\\\"Crown told the minister that a negative finding against it could result in defaulting on debts worth $700 million.This would have \\\"severe consequences\\\" for Crown and all its stakeholders, the company said, including shareholders, employees, unions, trade creditors, patrons and the hotel precinct and Melbourne tourism industry.Crown Resorts has received takeover offers from The Star entertainment group, which owns venues in Sydney, the Gold Coast and Brisbane, as well as US private investment firms Oaktree Capital and the Blackstone Group.Any suitor will want a guarantee that Crown's casino licence is not suspended, the letter stated.The company told the consumer affairs minister that it acknowledged the commission's role in \\\"shedding light on prior failures of culture, systems and people\\\" so that such failings are not repeated.It said it would consider terminating employment of any executives or employees that the royal commission makes adverse findings against.Friday marks the final day of eight weeks of hearings into the casino operator, in which more than 60 witnesses have given evidence.The hearings have covered failings and lack of compliance of the Melbourne casino, including that only 12 staff were employed to ensure an estimated 64,000 daily visitors gambled responsibly.It also emerged that Crown had underpaid gaming taxes by the millions, though two letters made public by the commission on Friday stated Crown had underpaid by $8.8 million - not $272.6 million as previously reported.\\\"It is Crown's intention to pay our estimation of the amount owing, together with penalty interest,\\\" chief executive officer Steve McCann wrote to both the gaming regulator and the Department of Treasury and Finance on July 1.Commissioner Ray Finkelstein is expected to deliver a final report detailing his findings and recommendations by October 15.His inquiry centred on Crown's Melbourne operations follows the Bergin inquiry in NSW, which in February found Crown unfit to run a casino at its Barangaroo complex in Sydney.Separately, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation (VCGLR) on Friday confirmed that an independent investigation will examine serious criminal allegations at Melbourne's Crown Casino.The allegations, made by former inspectors of the casino, will be investigated by prominent QC Ian Freckelton.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Queensland prop Christian Welch concedes his NRL colleagues must stop \\\"thinking they're above the average man or woman\\\" after teammate Jai Arrow was sent packing from camp for the code's latest COVID-19 bubble breach.Arrow was fined $35,000 and banned for two games after allegedly sneaking a woman into their Gold Coast camp in a breach of the NRL's COVID-19 protocols.His indiscretion comes in the same week 13 St George Illawarra players were punished by the police, the NRL and their club for attending a party at the now-sacked Paul Vaughan's house.Incredibly, extra around-the-clock security has been deployed at the Maroons' accommodation to ensure no further COVID-19 breaches.Maroons coach Paul Green on Friday read out a short statement deferring questions to the NRL, leaving Welch to answer for his teammate ahead of next week's third State of Origin in Newcastle.Asked why governments should continue to grant exemptions to the NRL, the Melbourne prop - himself penalised for inviting a guest into the Storm's Sunshine Coast camp last season - didn't side-step the issue.\\\"It's a good question to be honest; specifically rugby league and NRL male players need to lift our game by abiding by COVID rules and not thinking we're above the average man or woman,\\\" he said.\\\"I've been through that process where I made that really poor decision and there's been a few others this year and it's something we really need to get a hold of because it's doing a lot of damage ... it could jeopardise the game.\\\"Instances like this don't auger well for how you're perceived and getting towelled up in games of rugby league doesn't help either.\\\"So we've got a lot of work to do as a group to regain the trust of not only Queensland rugby league fans, but the public in general.\\\"Green, on a one-year deal with Queensland, offered a statement but refused to take questions before training on Friday.Welch defended his coach as the side attempts to avoid the worst series defeat in Origin history - the Blues currently lead 76-6.\\\"He's had a pretty rough 48 hours trying to deal with the situation,\\\" Welch said.\\\"His first year as Maroons coach and it hasn't gone as well as we would've hoped.\\\"We've had a tough series. Go back 12 months and talk about the culture of the Maroons and it's pretty much the same staff, playing group.\\\"Greeny's come in for Wayne (Bennett) but otherwise it's pretty much identical, the group that's here.\\\"Welch said he wouldn't \\\"bag the bloke\\\" and that he'd still be happy to play alongside Arrow in a Queensland jersey.\\\"It took me a fair bit as well (to recover from); you do it pretty tough those first few days but you can't do much other than put your hand up and own it,\\\" he said.\\\"Then you put your head down and win back that trust.\\\"\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Fodder quality is key for livestock producers.And if they can store hay and silage without risking any downgrades to the nutritional characteristics of the feed, even better.\\nThat's according to contractor Lee Hitchings.\\n'Farmers are feed testing more and putting in the types of crops that would suit higher energy and higher protein feeds,' he said.\\n'They are more conscious now of what they are baling compared to 10 to 20 years ago, they are more mindful of producing high quality feed.'\\nLee and wife Emma operate Hitchings Contracting at Irrewarra, just north of Colac.\\nFor more than 20 years they have been preserving fodder, cultivating soil and direct-drilling paddocks from the prime dairy country on the outskirts of Simpson, across to the grazing land of Barwon Downs and further north to where livestock production meets the vast fields of cereal crops at Cressy.\\nThey produce a total of 20,000 to 30,000 round bales each year \\u2014 including some of their own lucerne, clover and cereal hay and silage, which gets sold across the state.\\nThe Colac region has been famous for its productive grass-fed dairy industry, but in recent years the make-up of these farms has changed.\\n'Dairy production did go up and then it levelled out, some of the bigger dairies bought the dairies alongside them and some of the smaller farms have now gone over to beef,' Mr Hitchings said.\\n'We still supply them, just different types of feed.\\n'For those with beef, it might be a more fibrous feed like cereal hay at times of year instead of the clover and lucerne hay for the dairy.\\n'Some still feed some of that to beef, but not all the time, whereas with the dairy side of our business it's always about higher energy and protein feed.\\n'We bale straw and on-sell it to either dairy, sheep or beef farmers, they all use a bit of it now.\\n'Years ago, it used to be just dairy farmers using it in a mixer. Now we sell barley straw to people feedlotting beef or lambs and they are mixing it with silage.'\\nDairy makes up about 60 per cent of Hitchings Contracting business, with the remainder split between beef and sheep farmers.\\nWhether the farmer is requiring baling or the purchase of fodder, Mr Hitchings said quality was always front-of-mind.\\nTwo CLAAS mower conditioners help to maintain the quality of all pastures and crops during cutting, while Mr Hitchings and his team ted all silage and also hay when the weather isn't co-operative.\\nCrop packaging plays a huge role in ensuring the calibre of the feed is maintained.\\n'Farmers are always asking \\u2018what is the strongest net and plastic' and they are always wondering if we are putting on the best available net or plastic,' Mr Hitchings said.\\nSince 2001, he has consistently used Tama Australia's Triowrap, the multi-layered and UV-stabilised film used extensively throughout Australia and New Zealand.\\nFor him, Triowrap is proven in the paddock, with the film remaining attached to the bale in all conditions, protecting the silage from pesky bird holes, regardless of the ensiled crop.\\n'We use it for its strength,' Mr Hitchings said.\\n'If you have got something that lets the spikes of the grass, lucerne, oats \\u2014 and even rye-grass if it's dry and stalky enough \\u2014 punch through the film, it lets oxygen in and ruins the silage.'\\nMr Hitchings applies a minimum of six layers to each silage bale, but adjusts it for bales that require additional strength for trucking or those that will be stored for longer periods of time.\\nHe had some farmer clients this year who specifically requested additional net and wrap, and were happy to pay for it, as they were storing excess feed in preparation for drier years.\\n'By spending an extra $1 a bale you are going to have a bale worth $50 that you can feed.\\n'Once it gets damaged, that bale, you may as well say it is $20, it's gone half-rotten and lost its energy and protein. It's not even covering the cost it and milk production will be down, beef and lamb weight will be down.'\\nLongevity and strength in crop packaging is something Tama Australia works hard to achieve, and the company uses paddock trials to ensure its products can withstand different conditions.\\nTama Australia Western Victorian territory manager Phil Millgate provides back-up service and advice for Hitchings Contracting.\\nHe has worked with Mr Hitchings for years and said it was valued customers like Mr Hitchings that provide the real-word feedback needed to develop products for Australian farmers.\\nMr Hitchings has also trialed new products on small portions of his own crop.\\n'A customer trialing a product is great for us,' Mr Millgate said.\\n'For example, and with Lee's permission, I can say to other contractors about his experience and then explain the difference. In some cases, I can even say to them \\u2018go and ring him, ask him'.\\n'The lab tests are good, but as we find out a lot of things in the field, it is where we have to test it.\\n'It's good to have someone like Lee who has been working with us for a fair while.'\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Sydney's escalating COVID-19 woes have cast further doubt on when the city's two AFL sides will return home, with Swans coach John Longmire urging his players to ignore what-ifs ahead of a crunch clash with Western Bulldogs.NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has tightened restrictions while flagging that lockdown could extend beyond next Friday after Sydney's biggest spike in new cases since the start of the current outbreak.The Swans and GWS were slated to square off at Giants Stadium next weekend.The derby remains the only round-18 match that is yet to be assigned a venue, with the league trying to map out both clubs' movements in coming weeks.AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan told players in June that hubs were a last resort, noting he envisaged \\\"two, three weeks (away from home), max\\\".That time frame will soon be exceeded for the Swans and Giants.The league has made it clear it wants to reunite players and staff with families but, as the NRL mulls whether to relocate Sydney-based clubs out of the NSW capital, it is hard to envisage how that will happen in the short term.\\\"Take it day by day. That's all we can do, things change so quickly,\\\" Longmire told reporters.\\\"We're focusing on our footy and trying to make sure that families and loved ones back in Sydney are supported as much as they can be.\\\"You have to be really mindful in these situations that you don't spend all your time thinking about the what-ifs. You can spend a lot of energy on that.\\\"We trust the club and AFL are doing all they can to come up with solutions to get us home first and foremost, but also support our families and loved ones back home.\\\"Some players and staff were unable to bid goodbye to families in person, such was the haste at which they had to rush to a Melbourne-bound charter flight.The Giants are slated to face Essendon, Port Adelaide, Geelong, Richmond and Carlton beyond the derby, while the Swans finish their regular season with matches against Fremantle, Essendon, St Kilda, North Melbourne and Gold Coast.The Dockers-Swans clash looms as a particularly big stumbling block for the AFL and its desire to reunite players with families, given Western Australia's border policy.Longmire admitted that fixturing uncertainty made it harder to map out management plans for players, adding \\\"we just have to roll with it\\\".The Swans trained at Essendon's base on Friday, extending their nomadic stretch in Melbourne.\\\"We're fortunate the Victorian clubs have been great in allowing us access to facilities,\\\" Longmire said.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Queensland prop Christian Welch concedes his NRL colleagues must stop \\\"thinking they're above the average man or woman\\\" after teammate Jai Arrow was sent packing from camp for the code's latest COVID-19 bubble breach.Arrow was fined $35,000 and banned for two games after allegedly sneaking a woman into their Gold Coast camp in a breach of the NRL's COVID-19 protocols.His indiscretion comes in the same week 13 St George Illawarra players were punished by the police, the NRL and their club for attending a party at the now-sacked Paul Vaughan's house.Incredibly, extra around-the-clock security has been deployed at the Maroons' accommodation to ensure no further COVID-19 breaches.Maroons coach Paul Green on Friday read out a short statement deferring questions to the NRL, leaving Welch to answer for his teammate ahead of next week's third State of Origin in Newcastle.Asked why governments should continue to grant exemptions to the NRL, the Melbourne prop - himself penalised for inviting a guest into the Storm's Sunshine Coast camp last season - didn't side-step the issue.\\\"It's a good question to be honest; specifically rugby league and NRL male players need to lift our game by abiding by COVID rules and not thinking we're above the average man or woman,\\\" he said.\\\"I've been through that process where I made that really poor decision and there's been a few others this year and it's something we really need to get a hold of because it's doing a lot of damage ... it could jeopardise the game.\\\"Instances like this don't auger well for how you're perceived and getting towelled up in games of rugby league doesn't help either.\\\"So we've got a lot of work to do as a group to regain the trust of not only Queensland rugby league fans, but the public in general.\\\"Green, on a one-year deal with Queensland, offered a statement but refused to take questions before training on Friday.Welch defended his coach as the side attempts to avoid the worst series defeat in Origin history - the Blues currently lead 76-6.\\\"He's had a pretty rough 48 hours trying to deal with the situation,\\\" Welch said.\\\"His first year as Maroons coach and it hasn't gone as well as we would've hoped.\\\"We've had a tough series. Go back 12 months and talk about the culture of the Maroons and it's pretty much the same staff, playing group.\\\"Greeny's come in for Wayne (Bennett) but otherwise it's pretty much identical, the group that's here.\\\"Welch said he wouldn't \\\"bag the bloke\\\" and that he'd still be happy to play alongside Arrow in a Queensland jersey.\\\"It took me a fair bit as well (to recover from); you do it pretty tough those first few days but you can't do much other than put your hand up and own it,\\\" he said.\\\"Then you put your head down and win back that trust.\\\"\",\n",

This is an enormous difficulty\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009and remains the biggest barrier in the workplace and in education access.'\\nMs Radevski said St Paul's African House looked forward to working to change the narrative and work against racial barriers across the region. \\nPrinted copies of the report are available at St Paul's African House.\\nVideos in English, Dinka and Swahili can be accessed via the St Paul's African House YouTube channel.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Sydney's escalating COVID-19 woes have cast further doubt on when the city's two AFL sides will return home, with Swans coach John Longmire urging his players to ignore what-ifs ahead of a crunch clash with Western Bulldogs.NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has tightened restrictions while flagging that lockdown could extend beyond next Friday after Sydney's biggest spike in new cases since the start of the current outbreak.The Swans and GWS were slated to square off at Giants Stadium next weekend.The derby remains the only round-18 match that is yet to be assigned a venue, with the league trying to map out both clubs' movements in coming weeks.AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan told players in June that hubs were a last resort, noting he envisaged \\\"two, three weeks (away from home), max\\\".That time frame will soon be exceeded for the Swans and Giants.The league has made it clear it wants to reunite players and staff with families but, as the NRL mulls whether to relocate Sydney-based clubs out of the NSW capital, it is hard to envisage how that will happen in the short term.\\\"Take it day by day. That's all we can do, things change so quickly,\\\" Longmire told reporters.\\\"We're focusing on our footy and trying to make sure that families and loved ones back in Sydney are supported as much as they can be.\\\"You have to be really mindful in these situations that you don't spend all your time thinking about the what-ifs. You can spend a lot of energy on that.\\\"We trust the club and AFL are doing all they can to come up with solutions to get us home first and foremost, but also support our families and loved ones back home.\\\"Some players and staff were unable to bid goodbye to families in person, such was the haste at which they had to rush to a Melbourne-bound charter flight.The Giants are slated to face Essendon, Port Adelaide, Geelong, Richmond and Carlton beyond the derby, while the Swans finish their regular season with matches against Fremantle, Essendon, St Kilda, North Melbourne and Gold Coast.The Dockers-Swans clash looms as a particularly big stumbling block for the AFL and its desire to reunite players with families, given Western Australia's border policy.Longmire admitted that fixturing uncertainty made it harder to map out management plans for players, adding \\\"we just have to roll with it\\\".The Swans trained at Essendon's base on Friday, extending their nomadic stretch in Melbourne.\\\"We're fortunate the Victorian clubs have been great in allowing us access to facilities,\\\" Longmire said.\",\n",

(Photo: Twitter/@narendramodi) New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday chaired a high-level meeting to review the augmentation and availability of oxygen across the country and instructed officials to ensure that the oxygen plants are made functional at the earliest. Officials briefed Prime Minister about the progress on the installation of PSA oxygen plants across the country. More than 1500 PSA oxygen plants are coming up across the nation which includes contributions from PM CARES as well as various ministries and PSUs, a statement by the PMO said. PSA oxygen plants contributed by PM CARES are coming up in all states and districts of the country. Prime Minister was informed that once all PSA oxygen plants coming up through PM CARES would be functional, they would support more than 4 lakh oxygenated beds, the statement added. PM Modi instructed the officials to ensure that these plants are made functional at the earliest and to work closely with the state governments for the same. Officers apprised PM Modi that they are in regular touch with officers from state governments regarding fast-tracking the oxygen plants, it added. PM Modi asked officials to ensure there is adequate training of hospital staff on the operation and maintenance of oxygen plants. He also directed officials to ensure that each district has trained personnel available. Officials informed him that there is a training module prepared by experts and they are targeting training of around 8000 people across the country, the statement said. PM Modi also said that we should deploy advanced technology like IoT to track performance and functioning of these oxygen plants at a local and national level. Officials apprised the PM about a pilot being done using Internet of Things (IoT) for monitoring the performance of the oxygen plants. Principal Secretary to PM, Cabinet Secretary, Secretary Health, Secretary MoHUA and other important officials were present in the meeting. end-of\",\n",

And a person's thoughts can change at any time,\\\" Mengal said, adding that the country's rulers change their decisions often. \\\"I don't think the government is serious. These are not muzakrat (dialogue), they are mazakrat (a joke),\\\" he said, adding that the people of the province have been a victim of this \\\"joke\\\" since 1947. He stated that the government did not have the power or the authority to hold talks with insurgents. \\\"There are two areas in the region where the establishment has kept powers to itself. One is occupied Kashmir, and the second is Balochistan. 'No political government has ever been given the powers to resolve the issues of Balochistan,' Mengal said, adding that ground realities needed to be accepted. 'Has the establishment ever expressed remorse over what happened to the people of Balochistan?' he asked. Pointing towards the issue of missing persons, he called on the government to address the problems being faced by the people. \\\"You won't need a ticket to London or Switzerland to achieve this.\\\" Mengal said that work on the six-point agenda his party presented to the prime minister did not require permission from the establishment. \\\"However, when we used to meet him, he used to say 'go and talk to the army chief or the director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence'. From his language and from his actions, it is clear that the military establishment does not want to resolve the issue of Balochistan. \\\"They have a golden bird in their hands [...] they will never let it go,\\\" he said. National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik said that the province had been burning for the past 15 years, holding former military ruler retired Gen Pervez Musharraf responsible for the current wave of militancy in the province. Malik said his party had always advocated for talks with Baloch militants. \\\"Let me tell you frankly: the political leadership does not have the solution for this. It lies with the military leadership,\\\" he said. 'No difference between army and govt' However, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry rebutted the claims of the two politicians. \\\"There is a tradition among certain segments to say that the government and the army are separate. [But] there is no such problem in the current government.\\\" He said that the premier makes the decisions after listening to different points of view. The information minister also hit back at Mengal, saying, \\\"When he [Mengal] needs money for the budget or for favours, he has to speak to the government, not the establishment.\\\" Fawad, however, conceded that that there existed a point of view that Baloch insurgents should not be engaged at all. \\\"We will look at this on a case-to-case basis. We will see who we can talk to and who we can't.\\\" Fawad said that the premier had first announced that he was thinking of speaking to insurgents in the province. Then he appointed Shahzain Bugti as his special assistant on reconciliation and harmony in Balochistan. \\\"In the third phase, we will determine which groups we can talk to and which ones we can't. Then we will have to see what can be talked about, as well as what concessions can or can't be offered by the state.' He said that India linked groups had already been excluded from this process, adding that there was a difference between being linked to India and being used by India. \\\"It will be hard to engage with those who have taken money from India for terrorism in Pakistan. Those who were used [by someone], that is another matter,\\\" he said.\",\n",

(Photo: Twitter/@narendramodi) New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday chaired a high-level meeting to review the augmentation and availability of oxygen across the country and instructed officials to ensure that the oxygen plants are made functional at the earliest. Officials briefed Prime Minister about the progress on the installation of PSA oxygen plants across the country. More than 1500 PSA oxygen plants are coming up across the nation which includes contributions from PM CARES as well as various ministries and PSUs, a statement by the PMO said. PSA oxygen plants contributed by PM CARES are coming up in all states and districts of the country. Prime Minister was informed that once all PSA oxygen plants coming up through PM CARES would be functional, they would support more than 4 lakh oxygenated beds, the statement added. PM Modi instructed the officials to ensure that these plants are made functional at the earliest and to work closely with the state governments for the same. Officers apprised PM Modi that they are in regular touch with officers from state governments regarding fast-tracking the oxygen plants, it added. PM Modi asked officials to ensure there is adequate training of hospital staff on the operation and maintenance of oxygen plants. He also directed officials to ensure that each district has trained personnel available. Officials informed him that there is a training module prepared by experts and they are targeting training of around 8000 people across the country, the statement said. PM Modi also said that we should deploy advanced technology like IoT to track performance and functioning of these oxygen plants at a local and national level. Officials apprised the PM about a pilot being done using Internet of Things (IoT) for monitoring the performance of the oxygen plants. Principal Secretary to PM, Cabinet Secretary, Secretary Health, Secretary MoHUA and other important officials were present in the meeting. ...\",\n",

Ramesh Pokhriyal (File Photo) New Delhi: Realizing the importance of continuous dialogue with all the stakeholders in crafting a new policy Dr Nishank successfully engaged with states' Education Ministers, Governors, Education Secretaries, and Vice Chancellors of Universities across the country. Efforts were made to reach out to 2.5 lakh gram panchayats to include everyone's opinion.\\u00a0In order to get feedback from\\u00a0 the entire country Dr Nishank got it translated\\u00a0 into twenty two Indian languages. In addition, he held a series of comprehensive meetings with the public representatives representing various regions of the country.\\u00a0Apart from meeting the MPs, Chief Ministers of the various states, he encouraged educationists to organise workshops and seminars in their institutions .\\u00a0NGOs and social organisations and government institutions were encouraged to hold a series of meetings and workshops on NEP 2020.\\u00a0This massive exercise\\u00a0 resulted in collection of more than 2 lakh suggestions across India and abroad .\\u00a0Considered to be one of the largest open innovative exercise, the\\u00a0 wide\\u00a0 consultation resulted in inclusion of stakeholders aspirations .\\u00a0The result is that the new education policy has been widely welcomed in the country and abroad.\\u00a0Infact, it is\\u00a0 for the\\u00a0 first time in the history of Independent India, that an India centric education policy has been formulated, reflecting the strong resolve to make India a knowledge-based superpower.\\u00a0The best universities in the world such as Harvard, Cambridge and Michigan have lauded this innovative policy. Being scientific research-oriented, practical and innovative education policy, foreign scholars have also heaped praises on the new education policy.\\u00a0More than 100 top institutions of the\\u00a0 world have analyzed and appreciated various aspects of the National education policy.\\u00a0This new education policy will in fact provide a strong foundation to build\\u00a0 New India. It's only through successful implementation of this policy that we can fulfill the dream of making India a 'Vishwa Guru' in future.\\u00a0Considering the important and central role of students in implementation , the education policy focuses on providing them excellent training opportunities with a focus to transform them completely.\\u00a0Number of positive measures are being undertaken to make our students strategically competitive at the global level.\\u00a0The fact that Dr Nishank maintained continuous dialogue with all the stakeholders was also widely appreciated.\\u00a0The move was\\u00a0 widely welcomed by the students and teachers alike during the difficult and challenging times of corona .\\u00a0Addressing the children from the AIIMS does\\u00a0 reflect his deep concern\\u00a0 and affection for the students.\\u00a0The education fraternity of the country will remember him as a minister very much sensitive to the problems and challenges being confronted by students.\",\n",

London: The 25-year-old, who said he was drawn to the Olympics as a boy by Michael Phelps' dominating performances, will be competing against the likes of Rory McIlroy and Hideki Matsuyama at the Kasumigaseki Country Club on the outskirts of Tokyo.\\\"Growing up, not many people knew I swam a lot,\\\" Jazz said in comments published by the PGA tour. \\\"My dad wanted me to become a swimmer.\\\"When I was between 4- to 8-years-old, I used to swim a few kilometres every day. It was crazy. Now I won't even go into the water.\\\"I would follow athletics and swimming and there was no golf back then. I used to watch Phelps dominate the pool, so it was a thing. The Olympics is the biggest stage for sports and it's a huge priority for me.\\\"At the age of 14, Jazz became the youngest golfer to make the cut on the Asian Tour at an event in 2010, then became a professional a day before turning 15.He took a brief sabbatical from the sport in 2016 to become a monk and the following year picked up his first Asian Tour win in Bangladesh.Now a six-time winner on the Asian Tour, Jazz came agonisingly close to his first European Tour title earlier this year when he lost to Daniel van Tonder in a playoff at the Savannah Classic.\\\"I don't like to daydream and I don't say things like I want to win the Masters one day or The Open,\\\" he added. \\\"I won't day-dream except for the Olympics. The Olympics is different and I would often think what if I can win an Olympic medal.\\\"Golf is not like any other sport and you don't need to be the best. You just need to have the right week.\\\"It would be mad to get a medal, it'll be crazy if I do.\\\"\",\n",

Kochi: The high court said it was concerned that every ''Tom, Dick, and Harry'' was collecting funds via crowdfunding for treatment of the children suffering from rare diseases and asked the state government whether it has any control over such transactions.\\u00a0Justice P B Suresh Kumar said the court does not want to interdict the crowdfunding process, but it wants the funds to go to the government instead into the account of some private individuals who may or may not give it to those who require the money.\\u00a0''I do not want every Tom, Dick, and Harry to collect money. Is there any state control over this collection of funds via crowdfunding? We should know where the money is going,'' the court said and added that if private individuals and entities can collect crores of rupees in a short span of time, why the government cannot? ''For providing free vaccines the state government could collect only Rs 68 lakh, while 18 crores were collected in a week (for treatment of a boy suffering from spinal muscular atrophy),'' the court said.\\u00a0''I do not want to interdict the process of crowdfunding, but I want government control over it,'' Justice Kumar said during the hearing of an autorickshaw driver's plea seeking free treatment for his six-month-old infant son who is suffering from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) as the medicine for it costs around Rs 18 crore and he has no means to raise that kind of money.\\u00a0In his petition, filed through advocate P Chandrasekhar, the father - Arif - has said that while he obtained permission for importing the required medicine - Zolgensma Onasemnogene injection - he cannot afford to buy even one dose as the same costs Rs 18 crore.\\u00a0During the hearing, the Kerala government also expressed apprehensions regarding the source of the money being collected via crowdfunding.\\u00a0The court also observed during the hearing that such transactions if left unsupervised could destabilize the economy.\\u00a0It has on its own also impleaded the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the matter.\\u00a0The court said it would be passing a detailed order in the matter.\\u00a0Arif has moved the court, claiming that he cannot ensure his son's treatment without the support of the state government.\\u00a0The government, in a statement filed in court earlier, had said that neither the Health Department nor the Kerala Social Security Mission (KSSM) was in a position to extend financial support for bearing the huge cost of the treatment/medicine required by Arif's son, who has been admitted in the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital and is on ventilator support.\\u00a0The government had also said that according to the National Rare Disease Policy,2021 of the Union Health Ministry Ministry, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is categorized in Group 3, for which the cost of treatment is very high, and it recommends a digital crowdfunding platform be leveraged for mobilizing the necessary funds.\\u00a0It had further said that there are around 102 patients in the state suffering from SMA, a rare genetic disorder, of whom 42 have received the treatment under the compassionate use program extended by pharmaceutical companies.\\u00a0The state also said that the funds it has, Including those under the We Care scheme, are not even sufficient to meet the needs of various health schemes of the KSSM, which assists the elderly, cancer patients below 18 years of age, and minors requiring emergency treatment for various other ailments like heart disease.\\u00a0''In these circumstances, it is humbly submitted that the Health department and KSSM is not in a position to extend financial support for bearing the huge expenditure of SMA,'' the state had said in its statement and sought dismissal of the petition Kerala High Court | Crowdfunding | Rare Diseases\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Hurt by the criticism that has followed him ever since an injury-ravaged India upstaged Australia early this year, coach Justin Langer said most of it confused him. Washington: In January this year, Australia lost the home Test series 1-2 against an under-strength India, who made a heroic comeback under Ajinkya Rahane's leadership after losing the opening match in Adelaide.The visiting side battled the absence of star batsman and regular skipper Virat Kohli along with a spate of injuries to triumph in the series. Langer and Australia Test skipper Tim Paine drew heavy criticism for floundering tactically against a hampered rival.''Some of the things I was reading were a bit confusing actually. If I'm completely honest I was really hurt by some of it. The feedback I've been given for three years has been overwhelmingly positive of the role that I've been able to play as a coach,'' Langer said ahead of the T20 series opener against West Indies here on Saturday.Australia are currently touring West Indies for a five-match T20 series and three ODIs. Langer admitted that he didn't like losing to India but was committed to his job.''If the board and the CEO and high performance manager believe I'm the right person to keep leading us forward, absolutely. I absolutely love my job,'' he said.''I didn't like losing to India in the amazing series, no one likes losing. I'm absolutely committed, I love my job, I love the Australian cricket team, I love the players and I love Australian cricket.''They're the things I value most in my life. Hopefully I've done a really good job the last three years, that's been the feedback. Long may that continue.'' Langer was appointed as Australia's head coach in 2018 on a four-year contract, replacing Darren Lehmann.The former left-handed opener refused to rate himself as a ''great coach'', insisting that the team's focus remains on doing well in this year's ICC World T20 in the UAE and the home Ashes series against England starting December.''We're not a great team yet and that's what we're all aspiring to. Like I'm aspiring to be a great coach,'' he said.''I'm not a great coach yet, I'm aspiring to be a great coach. I'm working towards it and I hope all the players are doing the same thing,'' added the 50-year-old.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Published: Jul 09,202102:17 PM by PTI To stimulate the economy and ease the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman last month announced eight economic measures amounting to Rs 6.29 lakh crore to provide relief to individuals as well as businesses in the country. New Delhi: The Finance Ministry on Friday said the economy has started showing signs of revival from the impact of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the back of targeted fiscal relief, monetary policy and a rapid vaccination drive.'The broad-based economic relief package, extended to mitigate the second wave, amounted to Rs 6.29 lakh crore. RBI continues with its efforts to calm the nerves of the market and revive sectors with both backward and forward linkages and multiplier effects on growth,' the ministry said in its monthly economic review.To stimulate the economy and ease the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman last month announced eight economic measures amounting to Rs 6.29 lakh crore to provide relief to individuals as well as businesses in the country.Apart from eight relief measures announced in health and other worst affected sectors, Sitharaman announced a stimulus package for the tourism industry, which included five lakh tourist visas to be issued free of charge, once the government resumes issuance. The total financial implication of the scheme will be Rs 100 crore.Resilient tax collections of the central government in the first two months of FY 2020-21 and sustained momentum in capital expenditure, particularly in the road and rail sector, the report said, augurs well for continued economic recovery driven by capital expenditures.The report further added that the recently announced economic relief package was 'expected to further oil the wheels of the Capex cycle via implementation of the PLI scheme and streamlining of processes for PPP Projects and Asset Monetisation'.Consumption sentiment is expected to pick up with further enhancement of employment support under Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ANBRY), targeted support to the urban poor through the credit guarantee scheme for on-lending by micro-finance institutions and wider Bharat-Net digitisation coverage, the economic review for June said.Free food-grain and enhanced fertiliser subsidies under the package along with continued MGNREGA implementation, on the other hand, would serve as a cushion for rural demand in the coming quarters, it said.\\\"Maintaining a rapid pace on vaccination and quickly bridging health care infrastructure gaps across both urban and rural areas would emerge as the most sustainable stimulus for durable recovery of the Indian economy,\\\" the report added.Going forward, it said, further expansion of vaccination and strict adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour will be a critical safeguard against the emergence of a possible third wave.On high food prices, the report said, healthy monsoon coverage, gradually rising Kharif sowing and unlocking of states is expected to ease food, and thereby headline inflation.However, it said, risks due to global demand-led recovery in commodity prices and input cost pressures remain.About global economic growth, it said this has continued its upward trajectory in June 2021.Falling COVID-19 infections and accelerating vaccinations consolidated US recovery and renewed growth prospects in the Euro Area, it said, adding global trade remained buoyant with an uptick in global commercial flight and port activity, which portends well for Indian exports.However, it said, the resurgence of delta variant infections, firming inflationary pressures, unequal access to vaccination and burgeoning debt levels continue to lend substantial uncertainty to the global economic outlook. economy relief | Finance Minister | Nirmala Sitharaman\",\n",

Washington: According to Fox News, Kalman works as an art director and has collaborated with Travis Scott and Kng Kng Records, among others.Hadid was first romantically linked to the artist in early June when they were spotted out on a lunch date together. As per reports, they were apparently introduced through friends and their relationship started up following her split from on-again-off-again boyfriend The Weeknd, who sparked his own romance rumors this week after dining with Angelina Jolie.However long the pair have been dating, the model does not seem to be keeping Kalman under wraps anymore.

Kalman has also done projects in the fashion industry sphere, designing logo art for Made Fashion Week and fashion brand A Bathing Ape.

(Image credit: Social media) Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday urged the Centre to waive GST and customs duty on a life-saving drug to be imported from the US for the treatment of a child suffering from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a rare disease, in the state. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he detailed the plight of 18-month-old Muhammed, a native of Kannur district, who is undergoing treatment for the disease. Noting that the medicine for SMA is 'prohibitively expensive' and 'unaffordable' for the child's family, Vijayan said it costs a whopping Rs 18 crore and is proposed to be imported from the US. The CM, in the letter, also pointed out that the central government had recently waived tax in a similar case of a five month old child, who is suffering from SMA in Mumbai. \\\"I request you to give directions to the Union Finance Ministry to take steps not to levy Customs duty and integrated Goods and Services Tax (GST) in this case involving the import of the life saving drug zolgensma,\\\" he said. The Chief Minister's plea to the Centre came days after funds for purchasing the drug had been raised in Kerala through online crowdfunding for Muhammed. Son of P K Rafeeq and Mariyumma, the child requires a dose of Zolgensma, which is considered as one of the most expensive drug in the world. The treatment committee had on Monday informed the public that over Rs 18 crore reached the bank accounts opened for the donations and asked the people not to deposit any more. The campaign was taken over by social media resulting in raising the amount within seven days from across the world. Incidentally, 15-year-old Afra, the elder sister of Mohammed, was also affected with the same disease. The medicine would have to be procured from abroad and the treatment committee had petitioned the state government to initiate the process for procurement. Medical experts suggest that the child will have to be administered the dose of the medicine before he reaches the age of two, family sources said. ...\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Published: Jul 09,202102:03 PM by Reuters Tokyo 2020 Olympics organisers have bowed to political pressure and rising COVID-19 infections and banned almost all fans from the Games just two weeks before they start, after insisting that they could go ahead with spectators. Tokyo: The decision, made after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced on Thursday a fourth state of emergency for the capital, all but robs the Games of their last hope for pomp and public spectacle.Japanese Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said he felt sorry for athletes but that the decision was the right one. \\\"Please stay at home for this Olympics, and share that excitement with families at home,\\\" he told a news conference.The Games, postponed from last year, are scheduled to run from July 23 to Aug. 8, and opinion polls have consistently shown the Japanese public is worried about going ahead with them during a pandemic. In a recent media survey, 35% favoured no spectators, 26% wanted some limits and 34% wanted the Games cancelled or postponed. Spectators from overseas were banned months ago.The move also looks likely to snuff out a best-case scenario for Suga, in which he would call a snap general election soon after a successful Games that had rejuvenated his soggy support. \\\"That scenario has broken down completely,\\\" independent political analyst Atsuo Ito said. An election for parliament's powerful lower house must be held later this year and Suga also faces a reelection race for the ruling party leadership.Once seen as a chance for Japan to showcase its recovery from prolonged stagnation and a devastating earthquake a decade ago, the event has been hit by massive budget overruns. Medical experts have said for weeks that having no spectators would be the least risky option, amid widespread public fears that an influx of tens of thousands of athletes and officials would fuel a fresh wave of infections.REDUCED RISK, LITTLE BUZZ Tara Kirk Sell, an Olympic silver medalist in swimming and professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, welcomed the decision.\\\"It's obviously disappointing for everyone involved. But I think it reduces the risk quite a bit,\\\" she told Reuters. Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said on Friday that organisers aimed to decide on spectators at the Aug. 24-Sept. 5 Paralympics as soon as possible after the Olympics close.Asked about plans by top International Olympic Committee officials to go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, devastated by atomic bombs in the final days of World War Two, Hashimoto said the visits were a chance to send a message of world peace. IOC President Thomas Bach is to visit Hiroshima on July 16 and IOC Vice-President John Coates Nagasaki the same day.Remarks by IOC officials seeming to dismiss concerns about the pandemic have angered many in Japan and Hashtag #BachGoHome trended on Twitter on Thursday, the day he arrived in Japan. Japan has not suffered the huge outbreaks seen elsewhere but has recorded more than 800,000 cases and over 14,890 deaths. Tokyo reported 822 new infections on Friday, the 20th straight day of week-on-week rises.Just over 25% of the population has received one vaccine shot and supply glitches are causing an initially delayed vaccination rollout to stumble. Tokyo - which had been counting on a record boom in tourism - has experienced little buzz and excitement.The Tokyo leg of the Olympic torch relay kicked off on Friday with a small ceremony in a nearly empty park. The relay will be kept off public streets and only small ceremonies, with no public spectators, will be held over the next two weeks People will also be asked not to gather for events on public roads, such as the triathlon, though some venues outside the greater Tokyo metropolitan area will allow small numbers of spectators.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar said on Friday that there are clear signs of a fourth Covid-19 wave starting in Pakistan. In a message on Twitter, the minister said: \\\"Two weeks ago, I had tweeted that our artificial intelligence models are showing the possible emergence of a fourth wave. Now there are clear early signs of a fourth wave starting.\\\" Umar blamed poor compliance with coronavirus-related standard operating procedures (SOPs) and spread of virus variants, particularly Delta variant that was first detected in India, for the looming fourth wave of Covid-19. In another tweet, the minister said field reports were showing a complete disregard of the condition of vaccination for those attending indoor weddings, and going to indoor restaurants and gyms. \\\"If the owners of these facilities do not show responsibility and ensure compliance, there will be no choice but to shut them down,\\\" he said. Umar's warning has come just a day after Prime Minister Imran expressed worry in a video message over a looming fourth wave of Covid-19 and termed the Delta variant the \\\"biggest concern\\\". In his message to the nation, the premier had referred to Afghanistan, Indonesia and other countries hit by the Delta variant and expressed concern over the upward trajectory of Covid-19 cases in Pakistan, just days after they were on the decline. 'We fear the Indian variant could strike Pakistan and as a precautionary measure, we need to adhere to the SOPs,' he had said. Earlier, the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), the nerve centre of Pakistan's coronavirus response, had confirmed the presence of different variants of coronavirus in Pakistan, including the Delta variant, Beta variant that was first detected in South Africa, and the Alpha variant that was discovered in the United Kingdom. The NCOC had said that these variants were detected in Pakistan in May and June. The confirmation came amid an uptick in Covid-19 cases in the country. According to the government's Covid-19 portal, the number of daily Covid-19 cases dropped from four digits to three digits on June 25. The daily cases being reported remained close to the 900 mark till June 27 and further fell to 735 on June 28. Then the number of cases gradually started increasing and doubled in just one week. The positivity rate, which stood at less than 2 per cent in June, crossed 3pc after a gap of 20 days on Wednesday. On Friday, Pakistan reported over 1,000 Covid-19 cases for the third straight day. The country recorded 1,737 coronavirus cases and 27 deaths during the last 24 hours. Despite a rise in cases, Umar has said the government will not impose a complete lockdown during the fourth wave of the pandemic. Addressing an oath-taking ceremony of newly appointed members of the National Youth Council on Thursday, the minister had, however, added that a proposal for smart lockdowns was on the cards.\",\n",

The instructions come days after Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti took oath as the 51st LHC chief justice.

The use of mobile phones during court hours, apart from during intervals, was also prohibited. The court warned of disciplinary action against judicial officers using their influence for postings/transfers. It also warned of action against \\\"oft and unnecessary\\\" visits to the high court without going through the proper channels. In hardship cases, prior permission through the registrar shall be sought, it said. \\\"Keeping and displaying a blue light on an official or private vehicle of any judicial officer, or putting green plates on private vehicles shall also amount to misconduct and shall be strictly dealt with.\\\" It added that judicial officers were bound to strictly observe punctuality and wear an official uniform. The court warned that if a judicial officer is found violating the instructions issued, strict disciplinary action will be taken and the misconduct would also be added to their personal file, which will be considered during the time of their promotion.\",\n",

We last saw her on our television screens in 2016's Bin Roye. During her break from TV, she made her Bollywood debut alongside Shah Rukh Khan in the film Raees. Mahira will star alongside actor Kubra Khan and Usman Mukhtar. The serial is based on Umera Ahmed's novel of the same name and the script has been written by Ahmed herself. The drama is directed by Farooq Rind and produced by Nina Kashif and MD Productions. The drama tells the story of three characters \\u2014 played by Mahira, Kubra and Mukhtar \\u2014 and reflects on childhood traumas and how the wrong kind of guidance from elders changes their lives. Singer-songwriter Haroon Shahid plays a pivotal role in the story development as well, Kashif told Images. This isn't the first time Mahira has starred in a drama written by Ahmed. The actor was previously seen in the highly acclaimed Shehr e Zaat. Mahira recently took to Instagram to share a promotional poster featuring her character from the upcoming show. Her character Mehreen is bespectacled and looks quite serious, a persona that is quite the departure from how we've usually seen Mahira on screen in the past. While the release date for the drama has yet to be announced, Mahira's fans are already brimming with excitement on social media. Are you excited for Mahira's TV comeback?\",\n",

Chennai: The accused P Yogaraja and his wife Sasikala had assets worth a meagre Rs 83,000 at the beginning of the check period. But at the end of the check period five years later, it grew to Rs 2.1 crore, said sleuths from the agency.\\u00a0According to the FIR that the agency filed, Yogaraja enriched himself illicitly, in his name and in the name of his wife, when he was in government service. Most of the acquisitive activities of the accused officer and his wife took place between August 2014 and September 2019, said the agency, adding that it was hence chosen as the tentative check period to assess his illicit assets.\\u00a0Within those five years, he increased the value of his assets he possessed from Rs 83,000 to Rs 2.1 crore through his illegal activities. Of the total assets that the couple had, assets worth Rs 1.84 crore were disproportionate to his known source of income, the DVAC has found.\\u00a0Now, the accused official and his wife are facing a probe by DVAC, which has registered a case under Prevention of Corruption Act.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Published: Jul 09,202101:16 PM by PTI Militia attacks have only been increasing against the US in military bases in both Iraq and Syria. Baghdad: Iran's expeditionary Quds Force commander brought one main directive for Iraqi militia faction leaders long beholden to Tehran when he gathered with them in Baghdad last month: Maintain calm, until after nuclear talks between Iran and the United States.But he was met with defiance. One of the six faction leaders spoke up in their meeting: They could not stay quiet while the death of his predecessor Qassim Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a US drone strike went unavenged.Militia attacks have only been increasing against the US in military bases in both Iraq and Syria.Three missile attacks in the last week alone resulted in minor injuries, stoking fears of escalation.The details from Esmail Ghaani's visit, confirmed to The Associated Press by three Shiite political officials and two senior militia officials, demonstrate how Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia groups are asserting a degree of independence, sometimes even flouting orders from Tehran.Iran now relies on Lebanon's Hezbollah for support in reining them in, and there is potential that Iran''s new president could play a role in doing the same.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meetings.Iran's influence, sustained by ideological ties and military support, has frayed because of the US killing of Soleimani and al-Muhandis last year, because of differing interests and because of financial strains in Tehran. With nuclear talks restarting following US President Joe Biden''s inauguration this year, these differences have come to the fore.'Iran isn't the way it used to be, with 100 per cent control over the militia commanders,' said one Shiite political leader.Increasing rocket and drone attacks targeting American troops in Iraq and Syria have alarmed Western and coalition officials.There have been at least eight drone attacks targeting the US presence since Biden took office in January, as well as 17 rocket attacks, according to coalition officials.The attacks are blamed on the Iranian-backed militias that make up the bulk of Iraq's state-supported Popular Mobilisation Forces.The Biden administration has responded by twice targeting Iraqi militia groups operating inside Syria, including close to the Iraqi border.'What is taking place now is when Ghaani asks for calm, the brigade leaders agree with him. But as soon as he leaves the meeting, they disregard his recommendations,' said another Shiite political leader.The loudest of the defiant militia voices has been Qais al-Khazali, leader of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq faction, which also maintains a political party.On June 17, only days after Ghaani''s meetings with the militias, he said in a televised address that they would continue to target the U.S. 'occupier' and that they will not take into consideration nuclear talks.'And that decision is an Iraqi one,' he said.The coalition has formally ended combat operations and reduced troop levels significantly in the last year.Only 2,500 US troops remain in Iraq and discussions are ongoing with NATO to transfer to an advisory mission. Iraq still needs coalition support in surveillance and intelligence gathering and airstrikes against Islamic State group targets.Some argue the ongoing attacks benefit Iran by maintaining pressure on the US.During talks with Shiite political officials during his visit, Ghani said Iran doesn't interfere in their political work, but that military matters were different.'These must be approved by the Revolutionary Guard,' one political leader recounted him saying.Still, Ghaani did not reprimand the militia groups during the meeting. Instead, he told them he understood their concerns.Iran has struggled to fill in the gap left in the absence of Soleimani and al-Muhandis, who were commanding figures able to push factions into line and resolve disputes among them.\\\"Ghaani has a different style and capabilities,' said Michael Knights, a fellow at The Washington Institute. He has a looser framework, establishing broad red lines on some matters, while 'other things are don't ask, don't tell,' he said.Along with asking for less, cash-strapped Iran has been giving less as well.Assistance to the groups has been significantly downgraded since US sanctions began crippling Iran's economy last year.Divisions among factions have deepened, with growing competition among militias and Shiite politicians.Ghaani came to meet the militia leaders to mend tensions that were sparked weeks earlier when Iraqi authorities arrested a paramilitary commander, Qassim Musleh, prompting a standoff between PMF fighters and security forces.Ghaani brought a letter from Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, criticizing the PMF for its reaction, saying it weakened their position.To apply pressure on the factions, Iran has come to rely on Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah in Lebanon, a figure the militias highly respect.Almost weekly, various factional leaders hold face-to-face meetings with him in Lebanon, said Shiite political leaders.Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, elected in June, also may be a unifying figure for the militias, which hold him in high esteem, political and militia officials said.When Raisi visited Baghdad in February, he met with PMF commanders and told them, in fluent Arabic, 'Our flesh is your flesh, and our blood is your blood.' Ghaani communicates with brigade leaders through an interpreter.'The resistance will grow in power and will see its best of times due to the election victory of Raisi,' said Abu Alaa al-Walae, commander of Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, in a recent interview.\",\n",

According to the reports, the woman was reportedly accompanying a candidate who was filing nominations for the upcoming block panchayat polls. They also snatched the candidate's nomination papers to stop her from filing them in time. Taking to Twitter, the Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav shared the disturbing video and claimed that the miscreants were from the ruling BJP. \\\"The ruling BJP has held the law and order of Uttar Pradesh hostage.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too accused BJP workers of indulging in violence, alleging that democracy was being \\\"ripped off\\\" in the state. \\\"PM sahab and CM sahab should also congratulate\\\" on how their workers in UP indulged in stone-pelting and firing, looted nomination papers, beat up journalists and \\\"misbehaved with women. By blind-folding the law and order system, democracy is being ripped off,\\\" Congress general secretary Priyanka Vadra said sharing a video of the violence on Twitter. The State Election Commission had on July 5 issued the notification for the elections, for which nominations were filed between 11 am to 3 pm on Thursday. The last date to withdraw the candidature is July 9. Voting will be held on July 10 from 11 am to 3 pm and the counting will be held after that on the same day. \\nFor Breaking News and Instant Updates\\n Story first published: Friday, July 9, 2021, 11:13 [IST]\",\n",

Gesa Stedman, Professor of British Culture and Literature at the British Centre at Humboldt University in Berlin, delved into the archives with her team of researchers and gathered letters, photos and exhibits of the time, now on show at the Literaturhaus until July 30. With a 30-minute audio guide, the exhibition takes you on a fascinating tour of the city as seen through the eyes of the British writers who came during the exciting interwar years, later to be remembered as \\u2018Weimar Berlin'. In his 1929 guide, How to Be Happy in Berlin, John Chancellor warns 'the unwary tourist' about one of the city's infamous cabaret bars, the Eldorado on Lutherstra\\u00dfe: 'If you go in, go alone and under no circumstance allow your wife or sister to accompany you.' I guess it sets the tone: Berlin at that time wasn't for everyone. Yes, and this reflects the experience of many visitors \\u2013 not everyone was delighted to be here and enjoy all the sexual freedoms. Chancellor's How to Be Happy in Berlin doesn't go as far as some alternative city guides of the time, like Curt Moreck's Guide Through Vicious Berlin (Ein Fu\\u0308hrer durch das lasterhafte Berlin), but he does include some interesting nighttime dives and bars. And we thought that he captured the ambivalences of Berlin in that period very well indeed. One famous visitor who was ambivalent about Berlin was Virginia Woolf. Few people know it, but the writer spent a few days here in January 1929, right? Yes, and she was very ambivalent. She came to Berlin largely because of Vita Sackville-West, whose husband Harold Nicolson was charge\\u0301 d'affaires at the British embassy. The Nicolsons had all kinds of friends over at the embassy all the time, many of them writers. The whole Bloomsbury group wanted to come and see Berlin for themselves! And of course Virginia and Vita were lovers. Woolf came with her husband Leonard Woolf, as well as her sister Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, so it was a bit difficult because the two weren't actually on their own \\u2013 it was sort of a husband-and-wife thing. Also, it was an extremely cold January with Siberian winds howling through the enormous boulevards and slush everywhere. Who travels to Berlin in January? What did they get up to during the trip? They managed it all \\u2013 dinners, museum visits, even going to watch Podovkin's Storm Over Asia, a Soviet film (hence forbidden in Britain) and an absolute blockbuster in Berlin at the time. And then of course everyone wanted to go to a gay club. Just imagine: you are a British gay man in your 20s, coming from a very repressed background and then suddenly you end up in fairly cheap, pretty anonymous Berlin with its lovely seedy bars The men were supposed to go without Harold Nicolson, but he tagged along after all, so it's very amusing to read about it in Vanessa's letters! They ended up doing too much for Virginia. She didn't react very well to overstimulation. She also found Berlin very noisy, full of traffic and rather ugly. Berlin's ugliness, its \\u2018lack of style', from fashion to manners to architecture, seems to be a recurring theme. Berlin was a disparate, recently industrialised city. It certainly wasn't medieval and there were none of those 18th-century gems that British or French visitors were used to. They tried to make up for it by building large Prussian palaces, which are perfectly tasteless and always have been. That said, Brits\\u00a0abroad tend to be extremely arrogant. They liked to judge everything according to London standards. Many of them were extremely class conscious and very scathing about people who were not from their well-to-do, upper-middle-class or aristocratic circles. But Chancellor gets it. He says Berlin isn't to be visited for its 'beautiful corners' like London or Paris, but for the 'atmosphere of the city as a whole'. That could be advice from a modern travel blog! Completely. What attracted a lot of people then, like nowadays, were the offbeat things that you can't find on Ku'damm or in the central museums, in areas where Christopher Isherwood and his friends ventured. Virginia Woolf certainly didn't, even though as a Bloomsbury woman she was not constrained by Edwardian morals or anything like that. Vita Sackville-West explored the lesbian scene and described her sapphic outings in her letters to Virginia, but in an often dismissive, ironic way. All the same, these women limited themselves to the well-heeled City West. A gay man like Isherwood, looking for sexual adventures in joints like the Cosy Corner on Zossener Stra\\u00dfe (the Alexander Casino in Goodbye to Berlin), saw a very different side to the city, I imagine. Oh yes. The seedy bits were in a strictly working-class area in Kreuzberg at the time, not the posh bits of Kreuzberg we know today, say on Bergmanstra\\u00dfe with its cafe\\u0301s and boutiques. Isherwood and his friends didn't go to the glitzy cabarets. By German standards, they were rich, but they actually came on a small budget which they got from their parents. So they couldn't afford to go where Nicolson and Sackville-West went; the Eldorado would have been too expensive, no matter how favourable the exchange rate was back then. But there was one hotspot where everybody would go and mix, on today's Breitscheidplatz. Can you tell us about the Romanisches Cafe\\u0301? Anybody who wanted to be an artist or a writer or a psychoanalyst went there; filmmakers, cinema directors, actors... It was quite an international, cosmopolitan crowd. That's something that attracted British visitors, because they didn't have that continental cafe\\u0301 culture at home, where you sit all day working and writing in a large space drinking coffee. Romanisches Cafe\\u0301 had this reputation among Germans and Berliners from all kinds of countries as being the place to be if you wanted to get ahead in any artistic career or if you wanted to mingle with the right people. I suppose you could call it a cultural hub. There were also places where everyone \\u2013 locals and tourists of all social conditions \\u2013 would mix, like the famous Luna-Park amusement park at Halensee, with its huge, state-of-the-art wave , and the Funkturm radio tower with its restaurant, another big attraction. It was supposed to rival the Eiffel Tower, which might seem\\u00a0like a joke now, but the Alexanderplatz TV Tower didn't exist then. One thing I found very interesting in How to Be Happy... is that Chancellor goes to great lengths to reassure fellow Britons about potential anti-British feelings, which makes sense if you remember how bitter the German defeat had been and the terms of the Versailles Treaty. Was there widespread resentment against the victors of WWI? It depends when. In the immediate years after the war, you read that Berliners were quite reticent and talked about Versailles, not so much because they had lost the war but because of the terrible poverty. It does recede into the background quite rapidly when the economy picks up again, and by the end of the 1920s, Berlin prides itself on being an international and cosmopolitan city, on being the place to be (until the Great Depression sets in). Also, you have to remember that there's a greater resentment against the French than the English in the 1920s, as the French had been considered the arch-enemy ever since the Napoleonic Wars. You've mentioned a couple of times that Berlin was the place to be. How did it get that reputation? There were different reasons for different people to come. Alix Strachey went to Berlin first, so all her psychoanalytical network knew about it. Then she got to know other people, some of them friends of other Bloomsbury people. Then Eddie Sackville-West went to Germany because he thought he might want to be \\u2018cured' of his homosexuality \\u2013 but he discovered he didn't want to be \\u2018cured' and that it was actually much more fun being in Berlin and enjoying it! People wrote to one another and that made others come over. The same goes for Isherwood's trajectory: he was invited to Berlin \\u2013 or enticed, as it were \\u2013 by\\u00a0his poet friend WH Auden. It all worked by word of mouth. Berlin was also a big travel hub at a European crossroads, where rail would connect Eastern and Western Europe. Did that play a role? Yes, if you wanted to go further east you had to travel through Berlin. It was even possible to fly from Croydon in London if you were rich enough. Most didn't; they took the train and the boat. But anybody going anywhere in the Soviet Union went through Berlin. The city became the place to see Russian culture, because you couldn't do that in Britain. Cinema was a very important factor; it was not just by chance that Alfred Hitchcock came here to work on films at Babelsberg in the 1920s. At that time, Berlin was also a big centre for Freudian analysis. Many came here to be analysed or learn about Freud's methods, right? Yes, and my favourite is the psychoanalyst Alix Strachey, who came here in 1924-25. She was part of the Bloomsbury crowd and came to Berlin to be analysed by the famous Karl Abraham while working with her husband James Strachey on their translation of Freud's work, the first in the English language. Her letters to James (who stayed in London) are extremely interesting: they are very well written, but also rich in material. She writes about going to Abraham's Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute, about going to dances and balls, and she meets Melanie Klein and is instrumental in getting the author and fellow psychoanalyst to move to England. She goes to debates, political events, the theatre, cafes, indulges in coffee and cake all the time... It's a fascinating panorama from the early 1920s and it's very interesting because she pre-figures quite a few aspects that we are more familiar with in Isherwood's texts. And in Isherwood's words, some would come to Berlin 'for the boys'. Together with WH Auden and British writer Stephen Spender, he found here the kind of sexual freedom he was missing at home, picking up lovers in working- class bars and taking young flings to the lake to photograph them. England was extremely repressed and Edwardian in its morality. Even though homosexuality wasn't actually allowed here either, it was tolerated. For these young men, it was extremely liberating to suddenly realise that there were other people like them, that there was a scene for them, and that they weren't persecuted the way they were at home. Just imagine: you are a British gay man in your 20s, coming from a very repressed background and a\\u00a0stiff-upper-lip, circumscribed class culture, and then suddenly you end up in fairly cheap, pretty anonymous Berlin with its lovely seedy bars. Interestingly, Isherwood later wrote about the colonial aspect of all of this because not all of the young men were necessarily gay \\u2013 some were poor and prostituted them- selves. So there was an exploitative side that Isherwood wasn't aware of originally, but he did write about it later. Among the exhibits are photos Isherwood took of his handsome Berlin lovers, and you realise how suspiciously young these boys actually look. You are absolutely right. They could be underage or only just above the age of consent. At that time, there were discussions on whether the freedom to engage in gay sex should extend to boys \\u2013 not boys as in young adults, but boys, what we'd today call paedophilia \\u2013 so certain discussions about consent were already taking place back then. But I don't think the writers indulged in that in particular: they were 16 at least, or older, so almost adults \\u2013 one hopes. Parallels between Isherwood's anything-goes Berlin and the city today are pretty obvious, at least in many expats' imaginations. While digging into the archives, did you personally find those comparisons relevant? Yes, actually. When I started, the documents from World War I and immediately afterwards felt quite removed to us, but then, when I moved into the Strachey period \\u2013 so the mid-1920s \\u2013 suddenly parallels with today's times started creeping up, partly because we are still debating the things they debated then, and partly because the rise of fascism in Germany resonates with the crisis of liberal democracy we're seeing in quite a few countries nowadays. For some writers covered in the exhibition, wasn't fascism even part of the appeal of Berlin? Wyndham Lewis, Diana Mosley and Francis Stuart are the well-known ones. Lewis's 1931 book Hitler is terribly obvious because the British author was a proto-fascist who succumbed to a fascination with Hitler. There were a lot of proto-fascists floating around at that moment, some of them working at the Humboldt University, which was the Friedrich Wilhelms University before it was renamed. Stuart was one of them. He was born in Australia and educated in England, but counted himself as Irish. He came and lectured at the university during World War II, and he did it on purpose! He said, 'Oh no, I was just interested and I needed a job,' but actually he was an active supporter of Nazism. He was anti-British \\u2013 but not only that, he wrote radio broadcasts for and supported the English broadcaster that produced Nazi propaganda for English listeners abroad. That's very interesting to explore because do we read the work, or do we judge the writer on the basis of his politics? How does he defend himself? Why was he made one of the most important Irish writers shortly before he died? What do you think attracted these\\u00a0 expat writers to Hitler? His youthful revolutionary character, or was it anti-Semitism? They thought it was cool, it was powerful, it was great. Quite a lot of people agreed on the Jewish issue, including some of our left-wing writers. I think generally, this male cult of militarism attracted men from Britain. It wasn't just Germans who fell for that. Isherwood, who was here until 1933, didn't seem to be very interested in politics beyond the anecdotal, despite his intimacy with Jean Ross, the actress who inspired the famous Sally Bowles of Cabaret, who\\u00a0was a true communist. Yes, it's very interesting. Spender admits in his autobiographical texts in the 1950s that they dithered and sort of went to the left but it could have gone in the other direction. It wasn't so clear cut for these three young men where they stood politically, it wasn't that obvious. It was rather funny because we know that MI5 intercepted Isherwood's correspondence, and watched\\u00a0over him. But actually, I think you're right: in his case, it ultimately wasn't about politics. Those bombastic Nazi rallies sure did impress the crowds, and you do read about how British writers were thrilled and galvanised by them. But there were surely exceptions. What about the journalist Elizabeth Wiskemann? She was most certainly not galvanised or thrilled by what was happening, and she reacted very early on to the threats of fascism in a 1935 article for The New Statesman and Nation. Many women writers were overshadowed by their famous male counterparts, and Wiskemann in particular is one of the interesting ones who deserves to be rediscovered: she was really clearsighted in her analyses of 1930s Berlin, and outspoken about the dangers to come.

      "      \"summary\": \"To whom it may concern: And this concerns ALL of you. The Hot Tin Roof encourages Proud Boys, in full dress, to patronize their business and rub elbows with its largely young, diverse, gender-fluid, queer, and progressively open-minded clientele. This is a recipe for disaster. Pride flags or Proud boys? You can't have it both ways and expect downtown, or the local economy, to flourish. Terrorism or tourism? You make the call. I don't need to explain who the Proud Boys are. We all saw the violent insurrection on January 6, 2021. People died. They killed one Capitol Police officer and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with others. For hours. As well, I have zero tolerance for cop killers and their supporters. I went to the Hot Tin Roof on Saturday night, June 26, 2021. Proud boys in Proud Boy outfits were everywhere. I was enraged and complained. Kim Tesoro, owner of Hot Tin Roof, told me, 'Colin, calm down,' and I left. Ms. Tesoro and co-owner Mark Bateman sit on the Hillsborough Tourism Board. She is the vice-chair of the Tourism Board. The Tourism Board is responsible for the allocation of taxpayer dollars for events in Hillsborough. Ms. Tesoro also serves as the CEO of the Hillsborough Chamber of Commerce; the CEO of the Hillsborough Chamber of Commerce is a paid position funded through Chamber dues and some taxpayer dollars. Look at the Chamber's mission statement. Kim Tesoro is unfit for her position. However, the ripple effects from the selfish and short-sighted business decisions of Mr. Bateman and\\u00a0 Ms. Tesoro will, over time, negatively impact other downtown businesses and the town's ability to attract visitors, new residents, and new investment. This is completely unacceptable. And untenable. I was asked to calm down. The Proud Boys were allowed to stay. Hot Tin Roof security video recorded everything that happened. It needs to be reviewed by the Town Board, as well as Local and Federal Law Enforcement looking for domestic terrorists. If the Hot Tin Roof wants to become a safe harbor for domestic terrorists, they are a private business. Let them shoot themselves in the foot all they want.\\u00a0 A Proud Boy bar in the heart of downtown will be a lingering stain on the town, and the stink of its presence will keep a lot of people away, just when we need them most for the Covid recovery. Use your authority, courage, and personal integrity, along with the charters and bylaws of your organizations, government bodies, and formal committees, to remove Mr. Bateman and Ms. Tesoro from their positions immediately. They have disqualified themselves for those positions, and allowing them to continue in them is a slap in the face to the taxpayers of Hillsborough and Orange County.\\u00a0 As community leaders, each of you will be answering for your actions regarding this matter in forthcoming meetings, in the press, and most certainly as you move around town campaigning for the election. In other words, lead. T. Colin Dodd Hot Tin Roof\\u00a0posted the following statement on its Facebook page this morning:\\u00a0 We are deeply saddened by the allegations made by Mr. Dodd and we would like to take the opportunity to address it publically (sic). Hot Tin Roof has enjoyed a long history of inclusivity and diversity with our clients which we have worked very hard to ensure as a reflection of our own beliefs and convictions. We absolutely do not endorse or support in any way any kind of racist behavior, not now and not ever. Effective immediately, we are posting rules that absolutely prohibit anyone from wearing or bringing to our business any kind of insignia, emblems, etc. which represents any kind of hate group, including specifically the Proud Boys. Should any event like this happen again, staff will be trained to use the rules to have the person or persons removed from the premises immediately. We welcome the opportunity to move forward from this very unfortunate event with our customers and our community and with the resolve to continue our efforts to provide an inclusive environment free from any form of hate or racism of any kind. The INDY reached out to Hot Tin Roof owner Kim Tesoro, who is the CEO of the Hillsborough Chamber of Commerce as well as co-owner of Hot Tin Roof,\\u00a0for comment.

      "      \"summary\": \"The crucial role of a coach is undeniable in sports. Most people would say that he or she is one of the most critical people behind a team's win. Without a great coach, an athlete or a team will simply find it tough to win a competition.\\u00a0\\nBut coaches are not only found inside the court or along the racetrack. Some of them are playing and hustling, not in sports, but in business.\\nDid you know that many business owners of globally recognized brands have business coaches? These coaches help business owners by providing objective assessment, injecting new knowledge, and enhancing proactiveness and accountability.\\nHow business coaches get businesses and owners into shape\\n1| Objectivity\\nBusiness coaches can provide an objective, unbiased, and educated perspective when looking at your business' strengths, weaknesses, and strategies from outside in. They can give praise or criticism to help you improve. Not only can they bring in a fresh perspective, they can also bring in years of experience into your business.\\n2| Injecting knowledge\\nThey introduce new knowledge, tried-and-tested methods and strategies, and holistic advice on the business. Great coaches not only have a deep playbook of different tips and strategies, but also know where to find expertise when it's needed. By both bringing knowledge and also connecting you with the right people or suppliers, coaches help accelerate your learning process.\\n3| Action and accountability\\nMost importantly, business coaches hold the business owner accountable and ensure that all action plans are implemented. Many owners have great ideas and know how to grow their business, but are often too busy running the business that they do not have time to grow it. Coaches ensure you are on track, and give you the motivation and the push to take a step back to work ON the business and not just IN the business.\\n\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \\n\\n\\nSix steps to a better business\\nPaul Henshall, one of the top global business coaches from ActionCOACH and the CEO of ActionCOACH Australia & New Zealand, shared the six steps to a better business.\\n'It's the success of the businesses in the community that actually makes the community successful,' Paul Henshall said as he expressed his excitement for ActionCOACH Philippines in helping out local businesses grow and become even more successful.\\u00a0\\nAccording to him, there are six steps to a better business, and these could help in increasing profits and sales, freeing up business owner's time, and creating amazing teams.\\n1| Mastery - From Chaos to Control\\nMost business failures are due to the lack of management expertise. Under this first step, there are four areas that business owners need to master in order to eliminate chaos and create stability in their business. These are Destination Mastery, Money Mastery, Time Mastery, and Delivery Mastery. Destination Mastery is having a vision and direction for your business. Money Mastery is having the financial intelligence needed in order to manage your business better. Time Mastery is about the productivity and efficiency of your teams, your systems, and yourself as the business owner. Delivery Mastery is basically about the consistency of your business, from production to customer service.\\u00a0\\n'Consistency is the foundation for healthy growth,' he says.\\n2| Niche - Predictable Cash Flow\\nPaul Henshall says that Niche means business owners are not competing on price. This step urges business owners to find several unique aspects in what they offer and to find the one the market will buy because of them. Niche is also about creating greater profits. While most business owners focus on either marketing to get more leads or cutting cost to generate profits, ActionCoach focuses on 5 key drivers to create exponential profit growth - No. of Leads, Conversion Rate, No. of Transactions, Average Sales, Profit Margins. \\n\\nCONTINUE READING BELOW \\nRecommended Videos \\n\\n3| Leverage - Efficiency\\nThis step is about getting the business to work efficiently. An acronym to remember this by is SYSTEM which stands for Saving Your Self Time, Energy and Money by reinvesting in the business through setting up new systems, utilizing up-to-date equipment, and incorporating innovations. In order to systematize a business, a business should clearly define and fulfill its vision, mission, culture, SMART goals, organization chart, positional contracts, key performance indicators, how-to systems, and management systems.\\n4| Team - Structure for Growth\\nActionCOACH will help business owners in building excellent teams by using this four-point cycle. The 1) Owner should be able to create an amazing 2) Team so that they can best deal with 3) Customers, who will then contribute to the growth of the 4) Business. This cycle goes back when the business gives more to the owner. The keys to a winning team are strong leadership, common goal, rules of the game, action plan, support for risk taking, and 100 percent involvement and inclusion.\\u00a0\\n5| Synergy - Duplication\\nIn a survey conducted during the webinar, over half of business owners said they cannot take a long holiday as they feel their business won't run well without them. Installing a general manager will put the business on 'auto-pilot mode.' It is a state where all the people, systems, and aspects of the business are working harmoniously like a well-oiled machine, even when the business owner is not around.\\u00a0\\n6| Results - Growth and Freedom\\nOnce the fifth step is fulfilled, the last step which is Results will finally be achieved. In this step, business owners will find fulfillment in an effective, efficient, and profitable business that can run and be successful even without them. This will allow business owners to have time to focus on their own personal growth, to further grow their business, and/or to build a new business.\\n\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \\n\\n\\nActionCOACH is the world's largest business coaching firm with over 1,000 coaches in 80 countries coaching 18,000 clients weekly.

      "      \"summary\": \"Chevrolet Philippines has unveiled the Tracker, its latest offering in the highly competitive crossover SUV segment. The local distributor of Chevrolet says the Tracker is the latest model in its new-generation,\\u00a0global SUV lineup. It was named the bestselling utility vehicle in major Latin American markets, including Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, and is making waves in China, one of the world's biggest automobile markets.\\nThe new Tracker crossover SUV sums up its package with practical functionality, modern and athletic design, intelligent connectivity features, refined engine technology, advanced safety features, and smart cargo space.\\n \\nPhoto by Chevrolet Philippines.\\n\\n 'Bringing the new Chevrolet Tracker to the Philippines represents a new chapter in the successful and ever-evolving Chevrolet crossover and SUV story that we started writing in 1935 with the Chevrolet Suburban Carryall, the world's first SUV,' emphasized Christian Soemmer, president and managing director of GM Strategic Markets Alliances and Distributors. 'And the Tracker with its attractive design and state of the art technical features is the living proof of our 85 years of crossover and SUV expertise.'\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \\n\\n\\nAll-new Chevy Tracker\\u00a0\\nThe all-new Tracker's exterior and interior styling comes from the brand's new and dynamic design philosophy as well as sporty DNA. Its sharp, angular lines and body creases across its profile give the Tracker its sporty appeal. The front also has a squared-off LED daytime running lights, which double as turn signals, further enhance the Tracker's striking features.\\nPowered by a new generation 1.0-liter 3-cylinder DOHC Ecotec Turbo engine, the two Tracker variants are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission that delivers 116 horsepower and has a maximum 175 Nm of torque. The all-new engine is designed with smart technologies, which Chevy promises performance and better fuel economy.\\n \\nPhoto by Chevrolet Philippines.\\n\\n The Tracker also has an Active Thermal Management System with Electric Water Pump, Exhaust Gas Recirculation, and Variable Displacement Oil Pump, all of which makes use of otherwise wasted energy to optimize engine performance and maintain engine temperature, while expending lower battery power and fuel consumption. The Water-Cooled Turbo Intercooler helps improve mechanical durability and lengthens the turbocharger's life. The intelligent Start/Stop feature also lessens emission and adds to its fuel efficiency. \\n\\nCONTINUE READING BELOW \\nRecommended Videos \\n\\nInside, the dashboard's floating mount eight-inch colored touchscreen uses the latest generation Chevrolet MyLink Infotainment System for smooth smartphone integration with Apple CarPlay compatibility, allowing users to safely plot navigation, play music, read and send messages, and make phone calls using the vehicle's controls or Siri. There's also Bluetooth connectivity, with as many as four USB ports, and one SD card reader slot. It also provides more than 20 smart storage solutions and comes with multiple seating configurations, including 60/40 split folding rear seats and considerable cargo room. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\n \\nPhoto by Chevrolet Philippines.\\n\\n Two models\\u00a0\\nThere are\\u00a0two Tracker model variants: the base Tracker LS which is priced at P1.142 million and the Tracker LT Redline Edition is priced at P1.242 million. A special introductory discount of P30,000.00, regardless of mode of purchase, is available on the Tracker LS and LT Redline until September 30, 2021.\\n'We are excited to introduce the all-new Chevrolet Tracker to the Philippine market,' says Atty. Albert B. Arcilla, President and CEO of Chevrolet Philippines \\u2013 TCCCI (The Covenant Car Company Inc.), the country's distributor for Chevrolet vehicles. 'This highly acclaimed crossover is a welcome addition to our refreshed model portfolio. The Tracker continues Chevrolet's tradition of producing highly capable crossovers and highlights the brand's unrelenting focus on growing market segments by offering stylishly designed vehicles loaded with customer-centric technology.'\\n\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \\n\\n\\n \\nPhoto by Chevrolet Philippines.\\n\\n 'The Tracker will appeal to Filipino customers who want more from their crossover SUV. Available in two feature-packed variants, the Tracker offers fuel efficiency, safety, comfort, convenience, and connectivity packaged in a practical and capable SUV,' adds Atty. Arcilla.\\u00a0\\nThe all-new Tracker offerings come with the Chevrolet Complete Care package, which includes five-year warranty, automatic enrollment to the 24/7 Chevrolet Roadside Assistance for three years, and immediate access to the 24/7 Chevy Hotline for convenient vehicle service and ownership needs.

      "      \"excerpt\": \"The mission was sustained by mistakes that America seems destined to repeat | United States\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"FIVE YEARS ago the US embassy in Kabul unveiled an $800m refit. With 1,500 desks and 800 beds within its fortress walls, it was a third bigger than America's next biggest embassy, in Baghdad. Meanwhile Barack Obama's special representative to Afghanistan, Laurel Miller, had a troubled conscience.Her State Department talking-points insisted she should speak of America's 'enduring commitment to Afghanistan'. But Ms Miller reckoned the trillion-dollar American effort was on borrowed time. 'The phrase was dishonest enough to make me wince,' she recalls. 'I didn't think the strategic rationale for the mission or political commitment to it would endure.' She avoided the term.That might have seemed odd in Kabul, in the shadow of America's concrete citadel. But it was fairly obvious in Washington. Mr Obama, having dispatched 47,000 additional troops to Afghanistan early in his presidency, had lost faith in the mission. A steep reduction in casualties\\u2014the year the embassy relaunched saw one combat death\\u2014meant Congress and the media largely ignored it. And the foreign-policy establishment had never paid it the attention its claim on American blood and treasure warranted.Where the wars in Vietnam and (to a lesser degree) Iraq inspired generations of area specialists, America's small cast of Afghanistan experts has to this day changed little since 2001. Having spent a fair bit of time in the country during the first decade of the American mission, though very little in the second, your columnist is sometimes mistaken for an expert himself. It shows how low the bar to Afghanistan expertise has been set.This mismatch between America's vast investment in Afghanistan and the scant attention paid to it in Washington might seem paradoxical. In fact it helps explain how the slow-rolling debacle of America in Afghanistan came to pass.From the start, the American effort was not merely ill-informed about Afghanistan; it was only partly about Afghanistan. After bombing the Taliban from power, George W. Bush's administration was advised to reach an accommodation with the group. It posed no direct threat to America. And though unpopular in Kabul, the mullahs represented a large population in southern Afghanistan who found the Taliban's northern rival\\u2014and America's proxy\\u2014repugnant. Yet the administration considered any distinction between terrorists and their abettors incompatible with its expansive vision for the war on terror. It therefore ruled the Taliban irreconcilable. America has spent almost two decades being punished for that mistake.The insurgency it gave rise to ensured that America's stabilisation effort was dominated by generals, for whom force is the answer to most setbacks, and local politics a distraction. Yet the insurgency, because based in neighbouring Pakistan, was unbeatable. The result has been waves of terrible violence that have cost tens of thousands of Afghan lives and left many of the country's people craving order from any hand. This was the circumstance in which the joyless mullahs arose in the 1990s; it is why rural district after district is now falling to them as easily as they did then.The scholar Robert Kagan has suggested that America's history of large foreign-policy blunders is connected to its isolationist sentiments. To overcome them, American presidents embrace unrealistically grandiose schemes, he suggests; and at first blush Afghanistan looks like evidence for that. In pursuit of a Utopian ideal\\u2014to eradicate terrorism\\u2014America sought to produce an unprecedented Afghan state while fighting an unwinnable war.Yet the war's context has changed. Public opinion has played little part in it, because for most Americans it has been invisible. In 1968 America had half a million disgruntled conscripts and volunteers in Vietnam. At the height of the Obama surge it had 98,000 professional soldiers in Afghanistan\\u2014too few to fill the biggest college football stadiums\\u2014and suffered modest casualties. In a country of 330m people\\u2014a tiny minority of whom have any connection to the armed forces\\u2014the war has scarcely registered.This gave Mr Bush's successors freedom to try to fix his mistakes. But Mr Obama and Mr Trump doubled down on them, by initially bowing to the generals' demand for more troops and more fighting. They did so partly for political reasons. Mr Obama had talked up the war's importance so much on the campaign trail that he felt compelled to give it a fresh push. Mr Trump wanted to make Mr Obama look weak. But it was also, in both cases, for want of a more compelling alternative suggestion.National-security hawks remained largely opposed to the only conceivable way to end the conflict, negotiations with the Taliban. Few in the foreign-policy intelligentsia, which had come to consider Afghanistan a strategic byway, challenged that view. Mr Obama ended up passing the war on more or less as he had inherited it, with little conviction that it could end well. Mr Trump, to his credit, launched peace talks with the Taliban, but only after signalling his intention to withdraw America's remaining troops, dooming the talks from the start. This suggested that America no longer cared who controlled Afghanistan\\u2014a position that Joe Biden, by proceeding with the withdrawal, has underlined. What a way to spend $2trn.Back to GandamakIt might at least be hoped that the lessons of this debacle will be learned. The main one is so obvious: an over-militarised foreign policy that embraces unrealistic objectives is liable to fail. Yet, as Mr Kagan and many others have shown, this appears to be more a feature of American foreign policy than a bug. And indeed the light\\u2014almost imperceptible\\u2014mark Afghanistan has made on the Washington establishment suggests it may be forgotten especially quickly. Ms Miller predicts that Afghanistan will soon barely be mentioned in America's foreign-policy circles. Her forecasts have a solid record.\\u25a0This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \\\"What a way to spend $2trn\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Jul 10th 2021Milton KeynesIT IS MIDDAY in Milton Keynes, and a young woman is coming round after surgery on her vocal cords. Her breathing was controlled during the operation, so she is woken carefully, surrounded by blue-scrubbed medics. A chronic smoker, she issues a series of hacking coughs, attempting to clear built-up phlegm\\u2014and the medics are once more exposed to any illnesses she may be carrying.Throat surgery is known by a newly popular acronym: it is an AGP, or Aerosol-Generating Procedure. The entire point of ear, nose and throat surgery, says Hamid Manji, Milton Keynes University Hospital's clinical director for surgery, is to 'mess around with that airway mucosa, be it pharyngeal, be it nasal or in this case vocal'. That releases viruses, which is a problem during a pandemic.Lots of this sort of surgery stopped last year. Now theatres are deep-cleaned between procedures, and patients must isolate and take a covid-19 test before arriving. The result is an enormous backlog. Across England, and in all specialisms, more than 5.1m operations are waiting to be carried out, the longest list since records began. And the waits are increasingly lengthy: nearly 400,000 of these operations have been planned for more than a year, up from 1,500-odd before the pandemic.These numbers tell only part of the story. Some 4.6m fewer people completed elective treatment in 2020 than in the year before, as patients avoided their general practitioners and hospitals shut to all but the most unwell. The trend has not abated this year (see chart). Nobody knows when, or in what condition and numbers, these missing patients will eventually show up. But a year without treatment is certain to have taken a toll.All this is making politicians nervous. 'The public totally understand the cause now is covid,' says a senior Tory. 'The hardest thing to explain is that [waiting lists] will keep going up.' Sajid Javid, the new secretary of state for health and social care, has started preparing the ground, warning in an article for the Mail on Sunday that the backlog is 'going to get far worse before it gets better'. The last time queues were so long, under Tony Blair's Labour government, polling found that no issue bothered voters more.In the early 2000s Mr Blair sought to cut waiting lists by raising inflation-adjusted spending on the health service by at least 6% a year. Boris Johnson's government has so far promised \\u00a31.2bn ($1.7bn) extra, less than 1% of the health service's pre-pandemic budget. More is expected in the next spending review, due later in the year. By then, the true length of the queue should be clearer. So, too, should the health service's ability to get through it. 'We need to identify how fast we can go,' says Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals.One requirement will be to increase capacity. England has fewer CT or MRI scanners per person than any other European country, for example, so money has been set aside for 44 new community diagnostic hubs in the next financial year. That should free up equipment for patients in hospitals. Extra covid-19 funding is enabling hospitals to recruit local private providers. But the hope is that the health service can become more efficient, too.'They are now calling us Bones R Us,' laughs Krishna Vemulapalli, a surgeon in east London. Last year his hospital ran a 'bones week' to see how many joint replacements could be done in seven days, and to identify bottlenecks. Across six theatres, ten consultants worked from 8am to 8pm. An extra porter ensured there was no down time between patients. Lunch breaks were staggered. The aim was 100 joint replacements; they managed 135, with most patients going home the same day. The hospital has also tried a 'gut-feeling week' (to maximise endoscopies) and is planning 'ENT 3.0' (three times the normal number of ear, nose and throat operations).Bones week was an extreme example of 'high-volume, low-complexity' (HVLC) surgery. The approach originated in London, helping to explain why the capital has been quicker than other places to cut waiting lists. The surgical process is broken down into steps, from before patients arrive at hospital to their recovery, with hospitals benchmarked against the top 10% of performers for outcomes and efficiency. By streamlining the simple stuff, time is freed up for trickier operations. The health service now wants to spread HVLC across the country, and across specialities.NHS board papers promise 'air cover' (extra money) to reward top performers and to support stragglers. Yet cash is not the only obstacle. Covid-19 continues to be another, because hospitalisations eat up resources, cases cause staff absences and precautions slow things down. 'Even if it's only five minutes to clean the outpatient consulting room, it's five minutes on 20 patients, and suddenly you've lost an hour and a half,' says Joe Harrison, chief executive of the Milton Keynes hospital trust.Mr Harrison credits free parking and coffee for all staff with helping recruitment in Milton Keynes. Across the country, though, hiring problems will place limits on the recovery. Recruiting from abroad is increasingly difficult because of global shortages, notes Siva Anandaciva of the King's Fund, a think-tank. 'You can start expanding training places; you can start building medical schools, as the government is doing,' he adds. 'But will that bear fruit between now and the end of Parliament? Probably not.'Nor is the recovery the only task faced by hospital managers. A new NHS bill published on July 7th requires them to forge ahead with plans to move health care out of hospitals and integrate it better with social care. 'I was talking to one chief operating officer,' says Mr Anandaciva, 'and he was saying, \\u2018I feel like I've got two jobs: one is to go for the biggest elective backlog in two decades; the other is to make the biggest transformational shift in how health care is planned and delivered in 20 years.''In fact, reforms introduced in the early 2000s by Labour to deal with waiting lists are now being undone. Even with the focus on waiting lists, and lots of cash, it took Labour the best part of a decade to meet its targets. Few expect a quick resolution this time, but one date looms large. 'Health-care leaders know that ministers will be focused on the next general election,' says Mr Hopson. The government came to power promising to protect the NHS. Any failure to do so will be punished. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline \\\"The mystery at the heart of the NHS\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"The attack on Didi shows how high a price the Communist Party puts on control | Leaders\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"ONE INTRIGUING question about China is whether it can combine thuggish, autocratic politics with the predictable rules and property rights that entrepreneurs and capital markets need to thrive. The government's recent attack on Didi Global, a Chinese ride-hailing firm that has just listed its shares in New York, suggests not. It is a warning to investors around the world\\u2014and to anyone hoping to make their fortune by setting up in China.Didi is one of China's superstar firms, with 493m users (more than Uber), 15m drivers and a presence in Brazil and Mexico. It listed its shares on June 30th, raising cash from global investors and valuing the firm at $68bn. Its prospectus contained 60 pages of 'risk factors', including a regulatory crackdown, that most investors snoozed over. But almost immediately one of them turned up.It seems that Didi had pursued the listing against the wishes of the Cyberspace Administration of China. On July 4th the regulator struck back, saying that Didi had violated rules on collecting personal data, and banned it from mobile app stores in China. That sent Didi's share price tumbling by over 20%. Marco Rubio, a hawkish American senator, said that it was 'reckless' to allow Didi to float in New York.China's tech industry has been one of the most dynamic areas of the global economy in the past decade. Hundreds of large startups have yet to follow giants such as Alibaba, Tencent and Didi by listing their shares. The intersection of e-commerce, payments and 'super-apps' means that most daily transactions in China can take place on a smartphone. Global capital and talent have been critical to the industry's rise. Didi has big foreign shareholders, including SoftBank and Uber, and owns a stake in Grab, a South-East Asian rival. Many of its top brass were educated at Western universities and have worked at American firms. Almost all the largest Chinese tech firms are listed in America or Hong Kong rather than the mainland. They have cosmopolitan executives and benefit from a flow of ideas across borders.The crackdown began last year when Chinese regulators cancelled the $300bn flotation of Ant Group in Hong Kong and Shanghai at the last minute. The government went on to threaten other tech firms and to humble tycoons, not least Jack Ma, the co-founder of Alibaba and founder of Ant.All governments worry about data privacy and monopolies, but China's interventions signal a systematic attack on tech by the party. On July 7th Bloomberg reported that China might re-examine the use of 'variable-interest entities', a legal structure that underpins almost all foreign investment in Chinese tech. The message is clear: powerful tech firms must defer to the Communist Party, their bosses should keep quiet and foreign owners' property rights can be violated.An optimistic view is that the crackdown is political theatre. Global firms have often been burned in China only to recover. South Korean and Japanese companies have faced boycotts and protests that later faded away. China's government shuns foreign banks for a while, to punish them for perceived errors, but eventually welcomes them back.This time may be different. Foreign investors have lost hundreds of billions of dollars, which may permanently alter the supply of global capital to China. To fill that hole, Chinese firms will depend on less sophisticated mainland markets. Once again entrepreneurs and investors must weigh and reweigh the vast rewards of China's markets against the risks of its opaque laws, bullying officials and paranoid rulers. If you were risk-hungry, unorthodox and keen to start a business that breaks the mould, would you still choose to do so in China? \\u25a0This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Hit and run\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"A LMOST AS SOON as the tanks rolled into Naypyidaw, Myanmar's capital, in February, rumours began circulating on social media about how China would respond. It is a sign of its influence: China is probably the only country that could coax Myanmar's generals to the negotiating table. The speculation was laid to rest only in June, when the Chinese embassy referred to Min Aung Hlaing, the Burmese commander-in-chief, as Myanmar's 'leader'. The next day, China convened a meeting of foreign ministers from ASEAN, a club of South-East Asian nations, and included the military government's representative. With their putsch, the generals are trying to wind the clock back to 2010, when they still ran the show. China appears to be adjusting its calendar.China's leadership and Myanmar's top brass possess similar authoritarian instincts, but it was not inevitable that they would arrive at an understanding. The 'Sinophobic' army has long been suspicious of China, says Yun Sun of the Stimson Centre, a think-tank in Washington. During the decades of military rule, when Western sanctions choked the Burmese economy, the regime survived because of Chinese trade and investment. But the junta was wary of depending too heavily on its northern neighbour. Intent on improving relations with the West, it liberalised the economy and put Myanmar on a path to democracy.In turn, China made a friend in Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy activist who became de facto leader of the country in 2016. She went on to sign billions of dollars worth of deals with China before being toppled by the army. China probably would have preferred Ms Suu Kyi's party to remain in government, says Ms Sun. It helped that she was wildly popular with the public; her imprimatur on investments from China served to allay anti-Chinese sentiment.But Ms Suu Kyi is now under house arrest, and China is worried that the chaos in Myanmar will spill over the border, says Jason Tower of the United States Institute for Peace, an American-government think tank, also in Washington. Criminal syndicates are ramping up their activities in the lawless zones abutting Thailand and China. Refugees fleeing the violence are, despite border closures, trickling into China. Some carry covid-19. A Chinese city on the border was locked down on July 7th after the virus was detected there.The fortunes of Yunnan, the poor Chinese province adjacent to Myanmar, hinge on stability on the other side of the border. Chinese investors flocked across because they see Myanmar as a portal to South-East Asian economies. Oil flowing through a pipeline from Myanmar supplies a refinery that contributes 8% of the province's GDP. China's cherished hope of finding a trade route that bypasses the Strait of Malacca, whose waters are clogged with American warships, also rests on Myanmar. At the terminus of the pipeline, on Myanmar's western coast, China is bankrolling the construction of a deep-sea port which, once completed, will enable it to import oil and gas via the Bay of Bengal.China has bet that the Tatmadaw, as the army is known, will deliver on its promise to restore stability. True, the coup has provoked formerly quiescent rebel groups to take up arms once more. But the Tatmadaw, which has the ear of the Chinese government, argues that it has a good record of preventing the country from disintegrating. China suspects that the opposition\\u2014a grab-bag of ethnic rebels and deposed parliamentarians\\u2014is no match for the organised, disciplined military. Generals are speeding up several big Chinese infrastructure projects to show their sincerity.Yet by publicly backing the Tatmadaw, China may in fact provoke attacks on its interests. China's refusal to condemn the coup was interpreted by many Burmese as tacit acceptance. Thirty-two Chinese-linked factories were torched in March. In May, three security guards at the natural-gas pipeline were killed in an attack.China is concerned about an escalation of such attacks. But it is doing nothing to assuage the anger of potential saboteurs, to avoid crossing the army. Its officials have only limited communications with Myanmar's shadow government, which most Burmese regard as their legitimate rulers. Chinese state media are also antagonising the resistance by suggesting that they are being 'manipulated' by democracy activists in Hong Kong. China reckons that the hot-heads fighting the coup will lose steam before long, says Mr Tower. But it is a bet it would rather not have had to make.This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline \\\"The Myanmar trap\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"WHEN PARK HAE-RYUNG started her job at a big internet company near Seoul, South Korea's capital, she had high expectations. 'They promise you flat hierarchies, flexible work and a young, innovative workplace,' says the 26-year-old graduate. 'But what actually happens is that they give you tons of work without telling you how to do it. There's no structure and no communication. And you can't complain to HR because the person in charge probably went to school with your boss.' Ms Park (not her real name) is planning to quit as soon as she can. She says many of her colleagues feel the same.South Korea's work culture is notoriously punishing. Its people work some of the longest hours in the OECD, a club mostly of rich countries. Office-goers have scant control over their time and little chance to escape from bad management. They have long complained of gapjil, the authoritarian attitude of senior managers who abuse their power to shout at underlings, insist on unpaid all-nighters and weekend work, assign personal errands, and force juniors to go out drinking for hours upon hours.The country's most prestigious employers, such as Samsung, a technology conglomerate, attract the best-qualified jobseekers with well-paid jobs and generous benefits. But the perks come with strict hierarchies, long hours and no doubt numerous opportunities to experience gapjil.By contrast, relatively newer firms such as Naver (a search engine, among other things), Kakao (messaging) and Coupang (e-commerce), as well as many smaller startups, model themselves on their forerunners in America's Silicon Valley. They promise a meritocratic idyll where workers refer to each other by their made-up English names instead of their job titles, are valued as individuals and are judged on the basis of their ideas rather than the hours spent at a desk. There are beanbags.Yet a string of incidents in recent months suggests that South Korean workplaces\\u2014and bosses\\u2014are proving hard to change. In February workers at Kakao took to Blind, an app that allows verified employees to whinge anonymously, to lambast their company's peer-rating system, which they said encouraged personal attacks and poisoned the atmosphere. In April employees at Krafton, the company behind 'Player Unknown's Battlegrounds', a popular online game, petitioned the labour ministry to stop their boss forcing them to work overtime without time off.In May, an employee at Naver committed suicide after being bullied at work, causing outrage in the press, sermons from concerned politicians and union protests outside the company's headquarters. Coupang, the country's biggest delivery service, which has long been criticised for the conditions endured by its logistics workers, faced a consumer boycott in June after a blaze at one of its warehouses killed a firefighter. White-collar employees grumble about overbearing bosses and erratic decision-making at the firm.Some observers attribute the misery to growing pains at companies that are making the transition from startups to big corporations. One worker told a local news outlet that Korean tech firms seemed to be incorporating the worst aspects of Korean corporate hierarchies coupled with the American obsession with performance ratings. Others see the challenging work conditions as par for the course in a new industry. 'Nobody teaches you what the original process for something is because the process probably doesn't exist yet,' says Yu Dong-hyun, a 27-year-old startup worker in Seoul. 'You go to these places to grow and take what you can from them and once that's over, you leave.'The companies seem keen to be seen to tackle the problem. Naver's chief operations officer resigned in June following an inquest into the worker's suicide. The company promised to overhaul its management structure. Kakao launched a consultation process for unhappy employees. Krafton doled out extra holidays and said it would look into whether employees were working too much.It may be that the firms are serious. Until it is clear that they are, disappointed tech workers who cannot afford to take Mr Yu's advice to leave will have little choice but to stick to the time-honoured method of dealing with gapjil: grin and bear it.\\u25a0This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline \\\"(; \\u2014,_\\u2014)\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"MOST NATIONS are born in a flurry of optimism. South Sudan was no different. Ahead of its independence day on July 9th 2011, Salva Kiir, the country's first and only president, promised his people 'a just, equitable and prosperous nation'. Unshackled from its former overlords in the north, the new state would be 'united and peaceful' within three years, its founding fathers predicted.If any nation deserved some slack, it was South Sudan. In the half-century before it seceded from Muslim-dominated Sudan its people had known little but war, famine and enslavement. A decade later, however, South Sudan is neither just, nor equitable, nor prosperous. Having scoffed at those who suggested that it would 'slip into civil war as soon as our flag is hoisted' in his independence-day speech, Mr Kiir helped unleash one just two years later. It claimed perhaps 400,000 lives before a tenuous ceasefire in 2018.The blame for South Sudan's tragedy does not rest only on the shoulders of its leaders. The country's Western backers, particularly in America, were ludicrously unrealistic about what a state created from scratch, with little infrastructure or national identity, could achieve.Such was the naivety that, in the years before independence, some American officials took to handing out Milton Friedman's 'Capitalism and Freedom' to warlords preparing to swap their uniforms for suits. Others took up roles advising the new government on how to woo the foreign investment that would surely follow.The American advisers have since slunk away. (One now runs a distillery in South Carolina.) Most foreign investors, after all, shy away from war-ravaged states. That South Sudan is ranked the world's sixth-hardest place to do business by the World Bank and sits at the bottom of Transparency International's corruption index may clinch the matter for any still wavering.South Sudan's leaders turned out to be neither the cuddly human-rights champions imagined by the American left, nor the market-loving Friedmanites hoped for on the right. Instead, Mr Kiir's ruling Sudan People's Liberation Movement has proved to be murderous, larcenous and incompetent, as even once supportive Western officials now admit. 'We veer between despair and disgust,' says one.Beyond the political elite, it is hard to find many people who are better off than they were before independence. Few have seen any benefit from the country's dwindling oil wealth. Humanitarian agencies calculate that a South Sudanese girl is more likely to die in childbirth than to complete secondary school.There are a few reasons for cautious optimism. In 2018 President Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar, agreed to a peace agreement that more or less ended the fighting between their respective tribes. Mr Machar was reinstalled as first vice-president. Yet killing by ethnic militias continues. Four aid workers have been murdered in the past two months. Roughly a quarter of the population is still being fed by aid agencies; otherwise there would be famine. The deal between the president and his deputy is fragile. Should South Sudan ever hold its first election (as it is supposed to do in December 2022), civil war could easily re-erupt.Such a catastrophe could be averted. Western diplomats and regional powers hope to persuade both sides to strike a bargain whereby election losers are still granted a share of power. This could be done by rotating the presidency among ethnic alliances and guaranteeing vice-presidential slots to losing parties. South Sudan is short of many things, but not of vice-presidents: it has five. A federal system may pacify disgruntled minority groups.Such reform would happen only if the president and his deputy, who both dream of holding untrammelled power, were persuaded to resign. That step might help South Sudan avoid becoming a failed state. Sadly, it seems most unlikely to be taken.\\u25a0This article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Unhappy birthday\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"THE TONE was sharp. Both hands were thumped testily on the table. The water glass trembled. 'We're putting a mad amount of dosh into social benefits!' cried Emmanuel Macron, sitting with his advisers upon silk-upholstered chairs in the Elys\\u00e9e palace. The video, posted unapologetically by an aide, went viral. This was in 2018, only a year into his presidency, and confirmed what many of the French already suspected. Their new president\\u2014a former investment banker, who scrapped the wealth tax and picked one (and later another) centre-right prime minister\\u2014was a right-leaning liberal who secretly sought to reward the rich and demolish the mod\\u00e8le social, France's cradle-to-grave welfare state.The image endures. The president is still linked in the French mind to looser labour laws, an end to special pension rights for railway workers, and the longest strikes since 1968. In protest at his proposed (and later shelved) general pension reform, these seemed to bring France to a standstill, just weeks before the pandemic really did. Tough laws on security and Islamist extremism appeared to confirm a shift to the right. Today Mr Macron is muttering again about tightening pension rules to keep the French at their desks until later in life. France, a land of slow dining and swift indignation, is bracing itself for the worst. To revive pension reform now, said Laurent Berger, a (moderate) union leader, would be 'totally crazy politically' and 'socially explosive'.But what if, for a moment, the conceptually minded French were to set aside the boxes into which they so eagerly confine their politicians and take a closer look at what has also been going on? Those on the left who think the president has shamelessly betrayed all their ideals may find the evidence challenging. For Mr Macron has turned into something of a closet socialist.The most visible evidence of the president channelling his inner Mitterrand is to be found in his new relationship with the public purse. When the pandemic struck, Mr Macron borrowed a turn of phrase from Mario Draghi, vowing to spend ' quoi qu'il en co\\u00fbte (whatever it costs)' to fight it. Since then he has, in his own words, 'nationalised' wages and firms' operating accounts, spending ten times more last year to keep firms and furloughed workers going than France ever earned in a year from the old wealth tax.Macronian handouts have proliferated: \\u20ac300 ($354) for 18-year-olds to spend on 'culture'; an extra \\u20ac150 for those on benefits; up to \\u20ac650 a month more for health workers; university meals capped at \\u20ac1; free breakfasts at schools in deprived areas; free sanitary products for female students; an extra \\u20ac100 a month for retired low-income farmers\\u2014a proposal, incidentally, from none other than the Communists. 'We're catapulting billions' of public money all over the place, declared Adrien Quatennens, a hard-left deputy, as if unable to decide whether to applaud or disapprove.None of this, of course, is unique to France. Joe Biden's stimulus plan dwarfs Mr Macron's. Yet, before the pandemic, France was not only more generous and better at correcting inequality than America (not difficult). As a share of GDP it also outspent all the Nordic countries on social programmes (a lot harder). Mr Macron, in other words, has succeeded in expanding an already highly socialised economy\\u2014and in doing so pushed France's public-debt levels way above the current high European Union average.Less noticed is a growing corpus of progressive rights and rules Mr Macron has also introduced: a doubling of guaranteed paternity leave to four weeks as of this month, with one week compulsory; fines for firms that fail to close the gender pay gap; the right for gay women to free fertility treatment, a historic first for France.Abroad, Mr Macron is often judged a solo provocateur, out to impose France's views while claiming to speak for Europe. Less well known is his Gordon Brown-like record of championing progressive multilateral causes, including those now credited to Mr Biden, from a global minimum corporate-tax rate (a Macron pledge in 2017) to vaccines for Africa. 'Coming from the left,' says Cl\\u00e9ment Beaune, his Europe minister, 'I don't have any sense at all that he has betrayed the social-democratic tendency.'Why, if this is true, does none of it alter judgments of Mr Macron's politics? The answer may lie in what psychologists call cognitive dissonance. The president is an elite, tax-cutting ex-banker who recruits from the right; ergo, he cannot also be a lefty. Contradictory evidence confuses. In his well-cut suits and shiny leather shoes, Mr Macron simply looks an improbable defender of the downtrodden. When, in full presidential dress, he turned up to an online youth video studio and talked about the need to combat 'menstrual precarity' among the homeless, viewers were dumbstruck. Was this the same president who rejects woke culture, and once haughtily told a gardener to just 'cross the road' to find a job?Centre of attentionPerhaps such dissonance is what Mr Macron seeks. Ahead of the presidential vote in 2022, France's centre of political gravity has shifted to the right. This, not the left, is where his toughest competition will come from. Mr Macron's nod to the left is studiously mild by French class-warrior standards, and in line with his intellectual roots. If anything he is reconnecting not with Mitterrand but Michel Rocard, the Socialist ex-president's centre-left prime minister and a mentor (among many) to the younger Mr Macron.If Mr Macron gets no credit for progressive policies, this may also be intrinsic to his project. Vowing to be 'neither on the left nor the right', he is forever caught between inflated expectations on both sides and inbuilt dissatisfaction at the compromises pragmatic politics impose. Such is the lot of the radical centrist. Yet the contradictions may also quite suit a country that thinks it prizes theoretical purity, but is actually often happy to live with messy compromise. Unappreciated progressive, imperfect liberal, implausible conservative: Mr Macron's policy mix may work well enough in practice, even if not in theory. Vive la France! \\u25a0This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline \\\"The surreptitious socialist\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"'I WANT TO talk about happy things, man!' protested President Joe Biden in early July, when reporters asked him about the imminent withdrawal of the last American forces from Afghanistan, expected some time in the next few weeks. No wonder he wants to change the subject: America has been fighting in Afghanistan for 20 years. It has spent more than $2trn on the war. It has lost thousands of its own troops and seen the death of tens of thousands of Afghans\\u2014soldiers and civilians alike. Now America is calling an end to the whole sorry adventure, with almost nothing to show for it.True, al-Qaeda, which sparked the war by planning the 9/11 attacks from Afghanistan, is no longer much of a force in the country, although it has not been eliminated entirely. But that is about as far as it goes. Other anti-American terror groups, including a branch of Islamic State, continue to operate in Afghanistan. The zealots of the Taliban, who harboured Osama bin Laden and were overthrown by American-backed forces after 9/11, have made a horrifying comeback. They are in complete control of about half the country and threaten to conquer the rest. The democratic, pro-Western government fostered by so much American blood and money is corrupt, widely reviled and in steady retreat.In theory, the Taliban and the American-backed government are negotiating a peace accord, whereby the insurgents lay down their arms and participate instead in a redesigned political system. In the best-case scenario, strong American support for the government, both financial and military (in the form of continuing air strikes on the Taliban), coupled with immense pressure on the insurgents' friends, such as Pakistan, might succeed in producing some form of power-sharing agreement. But even if that were to happen\\u2014and the chances are low\\u2014it would be a depressing spectacle. The Taliban would insist on moving backwards in the direction of the brutal theocracy they imposed during their previous stint in power, when they confined women to their homes, stopped girls from going to school and meted out harsh punishments for sins such as wearing the wrong clothes or listening to the wrong music.More likely than any deal, however, is that the Taliban try to use their victories on the battlefield to topple the government by force. They have already overrun much of the countryside, with government units mostly restricted to cities and towns. Demoralised government troops are abandoning their posts. This week over 1,000 of them fled from the north-eastern province of Badakhshan to neighbouring Tajikistan. The Taliban have not yet managed to capture and hold any cities, and may lack the manpower to do so in lots of places at once. They may prefer to throttle the government slowly rather than attack it head on. But the momentum is clearly on their side.At the very least, the civil war is likely to intensify, as the Taliban press their advantage and the government fights for its life. Other countries\\u2014China, India, Iran, Russia and Pakistan\\u2014will seek to fill the vacuum left by America. Some will funnel money and weapons to friendly warlords. The result will be yet more bloodshed and destruction, in a country that has suffered constant warfare for more than 40 years. Those who worry about possible reprisals against the locals who worked as translators for the Americans are missing the big picture: America is abandoning an entire country of almost 40m people to a grisly fate.It did not have to be this way. For the past six years fewer than 10,000 American troops, plus a similar number from other NATO countries, have propped up the Afghan army enough to maintain the status quo. American casualties had dropped to almost nothing. The war, which used to rile voters, had become a political irrelevance in America. Since becoming president, Mr Biden has focused, rightly, on the threats posed by China and Russia. But the American deployment in Afghanistan had grown so small that it did not really interfere with that. The new American administration views the long stalemate as proof that there is no point remaining in Afghanistan. But for the Afghans whom it protected from the Taliban, the stalemate was precious.There will be a long debate about how much the withdrawal saps America's credibility and prestige. For all its wealth and military might, America failed not only to create a strong, self-sufficient Afghan state, but also to defeat a determined insurgency. What is more, America is no longer prepared to put its weight behind its supposed ally, the Afghan government, to the surprise and dismay of many Afghan officials. Hostile regimes in places like China and Russia will have taken note\\u2014as will America's friends.That does not make Afghanistan a second Vietnam. For one thing, the Afghan war was never really the Pentagon's or the nation's focus. American troops were on the ground far longer in Afghanistan than they were in Vietnam, but far fewer of them died. Other events, from the war in Iraq to the global financial crisis, always seemed more important than what was happening in Kandahar. And American politicians and pundits have agonised over whether to stay or go for so long that, now the withdrawal has finally arrived, it has lost its power to shock. To the extent that outsiders see it as a sign of American weakness, that weakness has been evident for a long time.Unhappy thingsShocking or not, though, the withdrawal is nonetheless a calamity for the people of Afghanistan. In 2001 many hoped that America might end their 20-year-old civil war and free them from a stifling, doctrinaire theocracy. For a time, it looked as though that might happen. But today the lives of ordinary Afghans are more insecure than ever: civilian casualties were almost 30% higher last year than in 2001, when the American deployment began, according to estimates from the UN and academics. The economy is no bigger than it was a decade ago. And the mullahs are not only at the gates of Kabul; their assassins are inside, targeting Shias, secularists, women with important jobs\\u2014anyone who offends their blinkered worldview. America was never going to solve all Afghanistan's problems, but to leave the country back at square one is a sobering failure. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Abandoning Afghanistan\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

When police charged Father Stan Swamy with terrorism and threw him in jail last October, friends of the Jesuit priest and human-rights activist feared for his health. They were right to worry. Prison wardens denied Father Stan, as he was known, in his 80s and shaking from Parkinson's disease, the use of a straw and sippy-cup from which to drink water until the press raised a fuss.Judges turned down repeated pleas for bail, even as his health declined and India entered a second, ferocious wave of covid-19 in the spring. They insisted that since he was charged under special terrorism laws, this frail old man with no criminal record, who had devoted his life to helping remote tribal peoples, must somehow represent a danger to the republic. In May Father Stan, now unable to feed himself or walk, was finally allowed to visit a private hospital. Doctors promptly diagnosed covid-19. Soon he was on a ventilator. On July 5th, as yet another judge was set to hear yet another bail plea, he died.The death of an 'undertrial', as India calls people who are yet to be found guilty of anything but languish in jail nonetheless, is not normally news. After all, they make up more than two-thirds of the country's prison population. Even the death of detainees accused, like Father Stan, under the draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), seldom raises eyebrows. In January Kanchan Nanaware, a 38-year-old tribal activist, died during her sixth year awaiting trial as a 'terrorist'.Because UAPA grants police sweeping powers to designate suspects as dangers to the state, and specifically limits opportunities for bail, lengthy periods of pre-trial imprisonment are not unusual. In a typical case last month, two Kashmiri 'terrorists', who together lost 18 years of their lives awaiting trial in prison, were acquitted for lack of evidence. In fact, of the 7,840 UAPA cases raised from 2015 to 2019\\u2014the last year for which numbers are available\\u2014just 2% resulted in a conviction. In nine-tenths of cases police did not even bother to frame charges. Despite the apparent failure of the law, the temptation to use it to lock up troublemakers seems irresistible: over the same period the annual number of UAPA arrests rose by 72%.In the case of Father Stan, it is not just the casual callousness that stands out. He was one of 16 co-defendants, all but one of whom remain in jail, in a case that police describe as a Marxist terror plot. They have tied the group, which includes distinguished academics, human-rights activists and a well-known poet, to a rally held in 2018 by low-caste Dalits (so-called 'untouchables') at a village called Bhima Koregaon, some 170km east of Mumbai. This was marred by a stone-throwing incident involving higher-caste Marathas, during which one person died. Police have also claimed the group funnelled money to Naxalite guerrillas seeking to overthrow the state, and were plotting to assassinate Narendra Modi, India's prime minister.So far, the only evidence produced has been electronic, consisting of files retrieved from the personal computers of the accused, all of whom say they had never seen any of this supposedly incriminating material. According to independent investigations by Arsenal Consulting, a Boston-based digital forensics firm, they appear to be right. Close analysis by Arsenal of two of the defendants' computers shows they were victims of malware attacks dating back to 2016, which allowed dozens of documents, including those later leaked by police as proof of a conspiracy, to be inserted surreptitiously into their filing systems. Separately, both Amnesty International, an advocacy group, and Citizens Lab, a Canadian research group, have found that Dalit activists were targeted by hacking software, typically sold only to governments, that permits remote control of devices.A statement from Father Stan's family and friends decries his death as 'the institutional murder of a gentle soul by an inhuman state'. That sounds about right.\\u25a0This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Father, who art in prison\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Jul 10th 2021ARCATA AND KLAMATHHERE IS A dilemma for environmentalists: more salmon or a continued flow of hydroelectric power? This question has been at the heart of a battle over the scenic Klamath river, which flows from Oregon through a long stretch of northern California. On the river's upper inland reaches, four hydroelectric dams produce enough power for 70,000 homes, and are capable of generating twice as much. But, detractors say, the dams prevent salmon and other migratory fish from reaching spawning grounds farther upstream. They argue that the dams must therefore be torn down.Barring a surprise, that argument has prevailed. On June 17th the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) granted a crucial approval needed for what will be the biggest dam-removal project in American history. Jared Huffman, a pro-removal Democratic congressman whose district includes the Klamath river's undammed lower stretch, says the FERC's decision means the opposition's chances to derail the project are now an 'extreme long shot'. The energy company, PacifiCorp, which is based in Portland, Oregon, plans to replace the hydropower by increasing electricity production elsewhere. Two-thirds of PacifiCorp's generation is powered by fossil fuels, mostly coal.Indigenous groups who fish salmon have led the charge for the dams' removal. Barry McCovey, a scientist who is head of fisheries for the Yurok tribe, which lives along the Klamath's lowest stretch near the Pacific Ocean, says the number of salmon that enter the river to spawn has tumbled since outsiders first arrived en masse in the 1850s. Salmon fishing, even for sport, is now sharply restricted.The salmons' decline has accelerated of late. Reduced rainfall is partly to blame. This has lowered and warmed the river, a predicament exacerbated by sunlight-absorbing artificial lakes behind the dams. As a result, fish parasites and blooms of toxic algae that devour oxygen have flourished. Sam Gensaw, a Yurok who guides tours in traditional canoes carved from redwood trunks, says living downstream from the dams 'is like slowly being spoon-fed poison'. A municipal official in Arcata, a coastal city an hour south of the river's mouth at the Yurok town of Klamath, sums up the local sentiment: remove the dams to 'flush the ick out'.DambustingThe demolitions are set for 2023. How much this will boost salmon numbers, however, is debated. Some argue that lava flows now submerged by the dams have stopped many salmon migrating farther upriver since time immemorial. This is why salmon don't appear in upriver ancestral stories of the Shasta Nation, an indigenous group in the area, says its chief, Roy Hall. He attributes the dwindling salmon more to global warming, and calls the removal of the dams 'environmental madness'. Once the lakes are drained, he fears that Shasta burial sites now underwater will be desecrated by pottery hunters.Of the four dams, only the one highest upriver has a fish ladder for migratory species. PacifiCorp describes it as 'antiquated'. Proponents of saving the dams have pushed for the other three to be fitted with ladders or even 'fish cannons'\\u2014tubes that shoot salmon over dams elsewhere. But proposals to install such aids have failed to gain traction. Cost is not the only reason. As Mr McCovey, the Yurok fisheries official, puts it, the goal is to restore nature, not build 'more anthropogenic bullshit'.Sentiments of the sort are echoed by other Yurok, a tribe that considers itself California's largest. Amy Cordalis, a lawyer for the the Yurok, describes the dams as 'a beacon of colonisation'. Frankie Myers, a senior elected Yurok official, calls the dams 'monuments to genocide'. Mr Myers says that as a young man he would sneak into outsiders' logging camps to 'monkey-wrench' operations by, for example, spiriting away diesel. Taking down the dams, he says, is 'a slap in the face' for what he deems the pursuit of material gain at the expense of indigenous ways of life.Upriver, attitudes differ. Referendums in conservative logging, ranching and farming counties inland reveal overwhelming support for the riverine status quo. These areas are hotter and drier than coastal redwood forests, so wildfires are common. Firefighting aircraft can scoop up water from the reservoirs without landing, notes William Simpson, whose ranch near one, Copco Lake, was saved from a recent fire. He calls dam removal 'reckless'.The political battle has become a microcosm of polarisation in America. So says Craig Tucker of Suits and Signs, a small political consultancy hired by the Yurok to tilt public opinion and negotiate with government, corporations and other stakeholders. Mr Tucker, who is based in McKinleyville on the coast, describes some inland counties as 'a hotbed' of 'anti-government patriot groups'. In liberal beach towns like Arcata, where hipsters, some in pyjamas, visit a marijuana dispensary in the downtown shopping district, support for the dam removals is strong. Betsy Musick, proprietor of a diner-cum-gallery in Trinidad, a picturesque coastal village near Klamath, describes the conservative-liberal dichotomy as 'lumber and pot'.PacifiCorp, for its part, has played the controversy brilliantly, at least as far as its bean-counters are concerned. Though the dams are structurally sound, the FERC made it clear that licence renewals would be subject to 'maximum conditions', says Scott Bolton, PacifiCorp's point man for the dams. Building fish ladders and jumping through other FERC hoops would cost perhaps as much as $650m, he reckons. It will therefore be cheaper to tear down the dams. PacifiCorp has managed to secure $250m of the project's $450m cost from taxpayers. The remainder is being raised with higher electricity bills.\\u25a0This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Dammed if you do\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"FEW COUNTRIES produce more cannabis than Morocco, where locals mix it with tobacco and call it kif, meaning 'supreme happiness'. The pleasure extends to Europe, where much of the cannabis ends up. Farmers in the Rif, a poor mountainous region in northern Morocco, produce most of the supply. They operate in a legal grey area. Growing cannabis is against the law in Morocco, but it is tolerated in the Rif.A bill passed by parliament, but yet to be approved by the king, may clarify the situation, at least somewhat. It would legalise the cultivation, use and export of cannabis for medical and industrial purposes (such as for hemp in textiles). The proposed law, though, would not legalise cannabis for recreational use. And it would allow cannabis farming only in certain regions of the country, such as the Rif.The Rif has little else going for it. 'There's no infrastructure, no schools, no hospitals, nothing\\u2014nothing except cannabis,' says Charif Adardak, who heads an NGO that promotes development in the Rif. It has long been a restive place owing to the government's neglect and what locals call hogra (humiliating treatment by the state). The previous king, Hassan II, crushed a revolt there in the 1950s. His son, Muhammad VI, has been more conciliatory, backing development projects in the region.But King Muhammad's plans have not got very far. Large protests by Riffians in recent years have at times turned violent. The region still relies on cannabis production. The government, in turn, sees its tolerance of the trade as a way to buy peace.One of the reasons Morocco is moving towards legalisation now is because in December the UN removed cannabis for medicinal use from its list of the most dangerous drugs. The proposed law will improve the lot of Riffians and free them from international drug-smuggling networks, says Abdelouafi Laftit, Morocco's interior minister. Regulating the trade may also allow the government to curb environmental damage in the Rif, which has suffered from deforestation and soil degradation as farmers have adopted new, hybrid strains of cannabis.Many cannabis farmers in the Rif think the government is blowing smoke. Some fear they will be run out of business by corporations or well-connected businessmen who are better able to navigate the rules. Farmers in the Rif are unaccustomed to growing cannabis to the strict legal standards that importing countries often impose on the medicinal sort.Others worry about future competition from other regions. There isn't enough demand for medical cannabis to keep even the Rif's farmers in business. Cannabis is grown on 73,000 hectares of land in Morocco, says Tom Blickman of the Transnational Institute, a Dutch think-tank. Demand for medical cannabis might support between 5,000 and 8,000 hectares.Demand is greater for industrial cannabis, but it is of lower value. Its production is 'about quantity not quality', says Mr Blickman. That's bad for the Rif. Tucked away in the mountains, the region's remoteness and inaccessibility make it an ideal place for illicit cannabis farming. But the production of industrial cannabis is easier in flat areas with better infrastructure that can support large farms.People in the Rif are also frustrated that the proposed law does not provide amnesty for the roughly 48,000 farmers who have cannabis-related arrest warrants hanging over them. Some, though, see the law as a prelude to legalisation of recreational cannabis. That would make many Moroccans supremely happy. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \\\"High in the mountains\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"IN JANUARY AN inhabitant of a midwestern city\\u2014Cleveland, say\\u2014could buy a three-year-old Toyota Camry for about $18,000 and fill up its 60 litre petrol tank for about $28. By May, the car would have cost them 22% more and the 16 gallons of gas 27% more. As the American economy has risen from its pandemic slumber, the prices of durable goods and commodities have soared.Not long ago economists tended to the view that the covid-19 pandemic would lead to a prolonged slump in the rich world. That view has not worn well. In February America's Congressional Budget Office predicted that growth in America in 2021 would be 3.7%. On July 1st it doubled that forecast to 7.4%. Since May the Bank of England has revised up its estimate of British GDP in just the second quarter of the year by 1.5 percentage points.With unexpected growth has come an unexpected spurt of inflation. A certain amount was baked in. The fact that prices\\u2014and in particular commodity prices\\u2014fell during the spring of 2020 meant that what are known as 'base effects' would drive headline inflation up this summer: even if prices had been stable from March to June this year, the fall over the same months last year would see the year-on-year difference increase. But core prices\\u2014which exclude energy and food\\u2014were expected to stay pretty stable.In February the median economic forecaster thought America's core consumer prices would rise just 1.9% over 2021. That increase is already in the rear-view mirror. In the three months to May core inflation reached 8.3% on an annualised basis, the highest rate since the early 1980s. In June the Institute for Supply Management's index of changes in the prices paid by American manufacturers registered its highest reading since 1979, a year in which consumer prices rose by 13.3%.Inflation in other rich countries has been more modest (see chart 1). But it has still exceeded expectations (see chart 2). In the euro area headline inflation year-over-year has risen from 0.9% to 1.9% since May, touching the European Central Bank's target of 'below, but close to 2%'. Much of this is due to base effects; core consumer prices actually fell between February and May, as they did in Japan. Britain is\\u2014as in many things\\u2014an intermediate case. Headline inflation is roughly on target but core consumer prices have accelerated. This has caused some alarm. When leaving his job on June 30th Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, warned that British inflation, currently 2.1%, would be closer to 4% than 3% by the end of the year.This is not just an issue for rich countries. A measure of aggregate inflation in emerging markets produced by Capital Economics, a consultancy, rose from 3.9% in April to 4.5% in May. Rising inflation has set off a cycle of monetary tightening. Since the start of June central banks in Brazil, Hungary, Mexico and Russia have raised rates.A sustained rebound in inflation would be bad news for two reasons. First, inflation hurts. Life-satisfaction surveys carried out in the 1970s and 1980s found a one-percentage-point rise in inflation reduced average happiness about as much as a 0.6-percentage-point rise in the unemployment rate. If it catches workers by surprise it erodes their wages, hurting the lowest paid the most; if it catches central banks by surprise they may have to slow the economy, or even engineer a recession, to put the beast back in its cage.Second, inflation has the potential to up-end asset markets. The sky-high prices of stocks, bonds, houses and even cryptocurrency rests on the assumption that interest rates will stay low for a long time. That assumption makes sense only if central banks do not feel forced to raise them to fight inflation. If prices rise too persistently, the financial edifice that has been built on years of low inflation could lose its foundations.The factors pushing inflation higher are threefold. The first is a boom in demand for goods like cars, furniture and household appliances set off by consumers splurging on things that made lockdown homes nicer and life outdoors more enjoyable. The second is disruption in the global supply of some of those goods. A shortage of microchips, for example, is severely curtailing the supply of cars. A higher oil price does not help. Disruption in the global shipping industry and at ports exacerbates things in various markets. The third\\u2014probably the most important, and the one only now fully coming to be felt\\u2014is a rebound in the prices of services. Consumers are returning to restaurants, bars, hairdressers and other in-person businesses faster than workers are.America is seeing higher inflation than anywhere else primarily because, having seen the largest economic stimulus, it saw the greatest durable-goods boom. According to the index of prices targeted by the Fed, cars, furniture and sporting gear were responsible for more than four-fifths of core-inflation overshoot in May (see chart 3). Europe's supply chain faces the same issues as America's, but with demand more modest, durable goods sensitive to the disruptions were only 1.5% more expensive in May than they were a year earlier, according to Morgan Stanley.For how long will engorged demand come up against constrained supply? The experience of 2020 showed that supply chains could find a way around some issues\\u2014such as shortages of toilet roll and diagnostic tests\\u2014relatively quickly. The trouble is that microchip supply and shipping capacity are relatively slow to adjust: expanding capacity requires investment in fabs and ships. Firms report that they expect delivery times to be longer, not shorter, in six months' time.But though some of the problems will persist, the contribution of durable-goods shortages to inflation may have peaked. Inflation is the rate at which prices change, not a measure of how high they are. If prices stay high but stop rising\\u2014or even just slow the rate of their rise\\u2014inflation falls. If prices fall back again, as American lumber prices did by a spectacular 40% in June, base effects go into reverse, lowering headline inflation.The increase in demand which drove up demand for durable goods in the first place is also dropping. This is not because people are running out of money. During the pandemic overall household spending went down, even though stimulus measures preserved or increased incomes. In America the resultant wedge of excess savings stands at around $2.5trn, or 12% of GDP. The equivalent in the euro area was 4.5% of GDP at the end of 2020. It is unlikely to have fallen much yet.It is, though, being spent on different things. With services reopening, those consumers flush with cash face a choice between paying high prices for goods they have been able to buy throughout the pandemic and buying the kind of experiences of which many have been starved for almost two years. They choose the latter.A new hopeIn inflation terms, this shift may push economies out of the frying pan and into the fire. High demand for hotels, transport and restaurant meals means lots of companies need workers. And the workers are getting pricey.Despite growing by nearly 350,000 jobs in June, America's leisure and hospitality is still only seven-eighths as big as it was before the pandemic in employment terms. Workers for whom $2,000 in stimulus payments earlier this year and extended unemployment insurance made a big difference find themselves in a seller's market. Wages in leisure and hospitality jobs are nearly 8% higher than in February last year; job openings are abundant. Restaurants and hotels tend to have low profit margins: where wages go, prices are likely to follow.According to JPMorgan Chase, average services prices across the world are still below their pre-pandemic level. Closing only half that gap in the second half of this year would add a percentage point to average headline inflation. In some places, though, labour costs look like eliminating the gap completely, and then some. In America median workers require a 3% higher wage to accept a job than they did before the pandemic, according to a recent survey by the New York Fed. For low-wage workers the necessary wage has gone up 19%.American economists have floated lots of possible explanations for the reluctance many people are showing towards jobs offered for pre-pandemic wages and under pre-pandemic working conditions. Some blame America's unemployment insurance top-ups and think wages will stop rising when they expire in September (they have already been curtailed in some states). Others suggest that restaurant workers are unwilling to return to such jobs while the virus is still at large, or that school closures are leaving workers stuck without child care.None of these explanations is fully satisfactory. Britain and Australia are also suffering worker shortages in some industries, despite not having generous unemployment benefits. It seems strange that young waiters, who could be vaccinated should they so choose, would see the restaurants to which consumers are happy to return as too risky to work in. A new paper by Jason Furman and Wilson Powell III of Harvard University and Melissa Kearney of the University of Maryland finds that additional joblessness among mothers of young children accounts for only a 'negligible' share of America's employment deficit, contrary to the conventional wisdom.Some speculate on causes with which it is harder for economists to get to grips. The psychological caesura of the pandemic may have given people the time to wonder what sort of work they want to return to, provoking soul searching and curious forays into new territory. Presumably at some point such job-changers will return to work, if perhaps in other sectors. But when that might be is not clear. Indeed, with the exception of enhanced unemployment benefits none of the putative causal factors provides a strong sense of how long the situation will last.Another price with plenty of room to run is rent. During the pandemic low interest rates and a demand for more space triggered an extraordinary house-price boom across the rich world: in April American homes were 14.6% more expensive than they had been a year earlier. Yet in America, the euro area and Britain rents remain beneath their pre-pandemic trend; in Australia rents have fallen throughout the pandemic. Renters are more likely than homeowners to have lost their job over the past year, and rents are highly cyclical, moving with the fortunes of the economy. But as economies and labour markets rebound, there might be some catching up and\\u2014if house prices are anything to go by\\u2014some overshooting yet to do. Rent accounts for one-fifth of core inflation in the index targeted by the Federal Reserve.Wages, rents and the like would have to keep on increasing rapidly for high inflation to persist. This might happen if the experience of the pandemic has changed the givens of the economy in some deep way\\u2014say, by permanently increasing the rate of unemployment at which wages and prices start to accelerate. But a more likely route to persistently high inflation would be a cycle of self-fulfilling expectations.So far, inflation expectations have not risen by anything like as much as inflation itself. Take financial markets. It is fashionable to pay close attention to investors' inflation expectations as revealed by the difference in price between inflation-protected bonds and the normal kind. Expectations rose steadily after President Joe Biden's election victory, which brought with it the prospect of more stimulus. Recently, however, they have fallen back to levels that are more or less consistent with the Federal Reserve's inflation target.In the euro area investors still expect the ECB to undershoot its inflation target over the next five years. In his warning on leaving the bank Mr Haldane pointed to a rise in long-term financial-market measures of expectations for Britain. But at 0.3 percentage points above the past decade's average this is hardly the stuff of nightmares. As for everyday consumers, surveys purporting to reveal their expectations in the matter have found them to be increasing, but only modestly .The phantom menace?These 'anchored' expectations give rich-world central banks some slack when it comes to ignoring temporary price surges. Changes in their attitude to inflation encourage them to make full use of it. Since August 2020 the Fed has been targeting an average inflation rate of 2% over the whole economic cycle. An overshoot now\\u2014the Fed expects inflation to be 3.4% at the end of the year\\u2014can make up for past or future shortfalls. The ECB, which expects inflation to be 2.6% at the end of the year, is on the cusp of making a change to its declared goals which will make overshooting its target more acceptable. (The unveiling of the new regime will come shortly after The Economist goes to press on July 8th.) The Bank of England also appears to have become more tolerant of the idea of inflation overshoots.The combination of anchored expectations and changing attitudes explains why central banks, and especially the Fed, seem so far to be relatively relaxed about inflation, making it clear that they are cognisant of the risks but staying well short of precipitous action. Thus in June the Fed signalled that it might raise interest rates twice in 2023, sooner than previously expected; some of its rate-setters have floated the possibility of doing so next year. Monetary-policy makers are also lining up to say they are ready to slow the Fed's purchases of assets this year.It is possible that central banks are pushing their luck. In the past, rapidly rising inflation expectations have typically been a sign that things have already gone wrong, not a sign that they are about to. 'Neither bond markets nor economists have a great track record at forecasting inflation,' concludes a recent analysis by Joseph Gagnon and Madi Sarsenbayev of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank. The idea that expectations could become de-anchored is 'not my biggest worry, but if it's not on your worry list, you're not thinking clearly about the issue,' Mr Furman said recently. (A senior economic adviser in Barack Obama's White House, he says his biggest worry remains a recession, because though its likelihood is low its consequences would be dire.) Oxford Economics, a consultancy, sees a 10-15% chance of the American economy shifting into a 'high-inflation regime' of price rises persistently above 5%.And only rich-world central banks, on the whole, have the luxury of securely anchored inflation expectations. Emerging markets, which are also suffering the acceleration of global commodity and goods prices, must be more careful about letting the genie out of the bottle. They must also pay keen attention to American inflation. As the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy, it puts downward pressure on emerging markets' currencies, making it more expensive for them to import goods and creating another source of local inflation. Emerging-market currencies have fallen by an average of 1.5% since the Fed's comparatively hawkish meeting in June.This is at a time when emerging markets' economies are on the whole less healthy than the rich world's because of their lower vaccination rates. The trade-off they face between helping growth and containing inflation will be painful. Yet though some central banks are raising interest rates, the situation is not acute. Both Russia and South Africa have recently floated the idea of tightening their inflation targets (currently 4% and 3-6%, respectively). That would be absurd amid rampant upward pressure on prices.Inflation is always worth taking seriously, not least because the belief that central banks will do so acts as a check in and of itself. If the Federal Reserve spends a few years trying to hit its 2% inflation target from modestly above it little harm is done. But this inflation carries an extra message. For most of the 2010s rich-world policymakers could not understand why inflation was so low, and feared that it was beyond their power to raise it. It is possible that, even now, the euro area and Japan may remain stuck in a low-inflation trap.America has demonstrated that a remarkable combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus can cause prices to accelerate even when interest rates are stuck at rock-bottom. That knowledge may prove useful to others and in times to come. The challenge now is to make sure that the price paid for it in terms of spiralling prices does not rise too high. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Boom and doom?\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"IN APRIL 1966 Time magazine stirred outrage in America when it published a cover story asking 'Is God Dead?', more than 80 years after Nietzsche had declared Him to be so. Today American religion looks less exceptional. According to a recent survey by Gallup, a pollster, for the first time a majority of Americans do not belong to a church. 'We are officially living in a pagan nation,' rued the editor of one Catholic magazine. Pollsters attribute the slump in church membership to the rise of the 'nones' or religiously unaffiliated, who now represent a third of the population. Yet it is a subgroup of the nones, those who believe in 'nothing in particular', that is redrawing America's religious landscape.Though usually lumped in with atheists and agnostics under the religiously unaffiliated category, nothing-in-particulars are a distinct religious group. They are twice as numerous as atheists and agnostics\\u2014nearly one in four Americans are nothing-in-particulars\\u2014and are growing faster than any religious group. As the cryptic name suggests, their defining characteristic is an aversion to being defined.'They do not want to be pinned down,' says Ryan Burge, a social scientist and author of 'The Nones'. In some ways they are remarkably average: unlike atheists and agnostics, who are predominantly younger men, they are more likely to be middle-aged, and are just as likely to be women as men. The majority of nothing-in-particulars believe in God, and a third of them attend church sporadically. Yet they reject allegiance to any religious group and are sceptical of institutional authorities. Wariness towards the covid-19 vaccine is an example of this tendency.Mr Burge says nothing-in-particulars are alienated from society in more ways than just religious affiliation. They have the lowest educational attainment of any big religious group\\u2014only one in five have a bachelor's degree or higher qualification. Nearly 60% make less than $50,000 a year. When it comes to politics they lean neither right, like most white evangelicals, nor left, like atheists or black Protestants. (Only a third of them voted for Donald Trump according to Mr Burge's analysis of the Cooperative Election Study.) They rarely take part in political activities, such as attending a protest, donating money to a campaign or even putting up a sign in the yard. 'Apathy is the big word that comes to mind,' says Mr Burge.Whereas Christianity has dwindled in America, nothing-in-particulars are growing at a breathtaking pace. Since 2008, when social scientists first began tracking them, their ranks have swelled by 60%. Mr Burge reckons there are two reasons for their rise. First, as America's religious makeup changes, it is becoming more acceptable not to identify as a Christian. It could be that their emergence is less about people leaving organised religion than revealing they were never really part of it. Nothing-in-particulars are largely drawn from that segment of Americans who have become disaffected as they have seen their economic prospects sink with recessions and the loss of well-paid blue-collar jobs. 'They are just left out of society, sort of drifting in space,' Mr Burge says.\\u25a0This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \\\"None of the above\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"QUITO HAS a lot going for it. Stretched along a breathtakingly high Andean valley beneath snow-capped volcanoes, Ecuador's capital is packed with historic buildings and enticing eateries. But it is woefully governed. In June the city council impeached Jorge Yunda, the mayor; he is charged with failing to hold city council meetings that would have solved an underground-railway crisis. He is also under investigation by the attorney-general's office on suspicion of embezzlement related to the purchase of faulty covid-19 tests (he denies both the embezzlement and the faulty tests). On July 1st the impeachment proceedings were affirmed by the electoral court. Mr Yunda now wears an electronic tag so that the authorities can monitor his movements.The mayor is not the only problem. A shiny underground railway costing $2bn has yet to be finished after five years of digging. Buses careen through the streets with little regard for road rules. Crime is rife: two policemen were shot in their car in June and a prominent criminal lawyer was gunned down in April. The 500-year old city 'needs to be reinvented', says Gonzalo Ortiz, a former city councillor.Quite\\u00f1os tend to point to 2007 as the turning point in the city's fortunes, when Rafael Correa, a populist, became president. His government pushed through a new constitution that called city administrations 'autonomous decentralised governments', but in practice weakened the authority of mayors. Even so the mayor of Quito at the time, Augusto Barrera, was an ally; he also stripped the vast metropolitan region's districts of their power.The new model failed to deliver the promised benefits. A new airport took three more years to complete than planned; Mr Barrera's administration failed to build a proper access road to it (it was finally completed, five times over budget, by his successor). A project to clean up the main river in the city was never completed; it remains a sewer. Mr Barrera started the railway project but only oversaw the building of two stations and did not bother to work out who would run it.In 2019 Mr Yunda won office with just 21% of the vote. His weak mandate has not helped matters, but he argues that now he is being targeted by a racist elite (he is of indigenous heritage). Whatever the cause, his shoddy management of the capital means that many are abandoning it for the wealthier suburbs, which are now thinking of seceding. Mr Yunda's legacy may be an emptier, poorer Quito. \\u25a0This article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Quitting the city\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"'S OMETIMES WE TURN up at crime scenes before fire engines and ambulances,' says Darren Toogood, editor of the Island Echo, an independent news site on the Isle of Wight. An army of 'tippers' share information about sirens and suspicious activity on a dedicated Facebook group. The yarns they yield are often thrilling. A 5am chase after a police helicopter led to a kidnapping. Another tip turned up a London gang stealing shotguns from a clay-pigeon-shooting range.\\n\\nFalling ad revenue and competition from social media mean local papers have been on life support for years now. Some 265 closed between 2005 and August 2020. Most survivors are now owned by conglomerates. Reach, which owns at least 111 digital and print titles (plus the Mirror, a national tabloid) closed four free papers in 2020. It also launched 19 'Live' websites, each with a similar layout. Its sites were viewed nearly 15bn times in 2020, two-fifths more often than in 2019.\\n\\nTom Baldwin, a former local journalist, has written a book about what he sees as a crisis in democracy, including the decline of local papers. This 'news-factory model' neglects their most important task, he says: holding power to account by covering court hearings, council meetings and the like. To the extent that this is still done, it is often by tiny, sometimes amateurish independent outlets. A survey by the Public Interest News Foundation ( PINF ), published on July 8th, found 200 independent publications with a turnover of under \\u00a32m ($2.8m). The 56 it surveyed had a median of just three staff members.\\n\\nMost are online-only, and see themselves as the opposition to mainstream local papers. They are a varied bunch. Birmingham Updates covers culture: a Spice Girls Bottomless Brunch at a local drinkery; businesses providing free school meals. The Manchester Meteor investigates 'local power structures': a bus drivers' labour dispute; a letter to the mayor about public land. Cornish Stuff expresses the local identity: a fisherman upset by a planning decision; silver discovered in a mine. Wiltshire999s, which closed in June, focused on crime. One of its final headlines was 'Hammer used after mass disorder breaks out at toddler's birthday party'.\\n\\nCompetition is particularly fierce on the Isle of Wight. In 2017 the County Press, a 137-year-old newspaper, was bought by Newsquest, an American-owned publisher. Last year it sold 15,000 copies a week, and in its highest month had 2.2m page views. It might be doing better, were it not for Mr Toogood's Island Echo, which was founded in 2012. It claims to have had 2.8m online page views in its peak month last year. Meanwhile the Observer, a printed free-sheet, claims to outstrip the County Press, with 18,000 weekly sales. Yet another online outlet, On the Wight, offers in-depth investigations into local scandals and social problems.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"CHENG WEI, the billionaire founder and chief executive of Didi Global, had scarcely a moment to revel in his firm's $4.4bn New York listing. Within 48 hours of the initial public offering (IPO), which valued the Chinese ride-hailing giant at around $70bn, regulators in Beijing spoiled the party. On July 2nd the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said it had launched an investigation into the company. The announcement shaved 5% off its share price.Two days later the regulator ordered Didi's mobile app to be pulled from app stores in China, halting new customers from joining the service (existing users can still hail taxis). The CAC alleges that Didi was illegally collecting and using personal data. Didi said that it would 'strive to rectify any problems' but warned of 'an adverse impact on its revenue in China'. Predictably, the ban also adversely affected the company's market value. When American markets reopened on July 6th, Didi promptly shed more than a fifth of it. It is now worth $22bn less than a week go.The CAC's move is an escalation in China's crackdown on big technology firms. On July 5th it told three other apps\\u2014Yunmanman and Huochebang, which operate lorry-hailing and cargo apps, and Boss Zhipin, an internet recruitment service\\u2014to stop enlisting new users. The trucking services, which merged under the name Full Truck Alliance, and Kanzhun, which owns Boss Zhipin, had together raised $2.5bn in American flotations last month.Wolf warrior of Wall StreetAll told, Chinese firms have raised $13bn in America so far this year, and $76bn over the past decade. Around 400 Chinese companies have American listings, roughly twice as many as in 2016. In that period their combined stockmarket value has shot up from less than $400bn to $1.7trn. Those investments are now in peril. On July 6th Chinese authorities said they would tighten rules for firms with foreign listings, or those seeking them. It is the starkest effort yet to disconnect China Inc from American capital markets.Besides regulating what corporate data can and cannot be shared with foreigners, the new rules would target 'illegal securities activities' and create extraterritorial laws to govern Chinese firms with foreign listings. According to Bloomberg, a news service, Chinese regulators also want to restrict the use of offshore legal structures that help Chinese companies skirt local limits on foreign ownership.Nearly all Chinese tech giants listed in America, including Alibaba, a $570bn e-merchant, as well as Didi, use such 'variable-interest entities' (VIEs). A VIE is domiciled in a tax haven like the Cayman Islands, and accepts foreigners as investors. It then sets up a subsidiary in China, which receives a share of the profits of the Chinese firm using the structure. China's government has long implicitly supported this tenuous arrangement, upon which hundreds of billions of dollars of American investments rely. Now it wants Chinese firms to seek explicit approval for the structure. The assumption is that Beijing would be hesitant to grant it. Existing VIEs may also come under scrutiny.A formal blessing from Beijing may help avoid the sort of kerfuffle Didi has found itself in. In April the firm was among 30 companies called in by the CAC and the State Administration of Taxation. It was given a month to conduct a sprawling self-inspection. It added a warning that it 'cannot assure [investors] that the regulatory authorities will be satisfied with our self-inspection results' to the risks listed in its prospectus, alongside antitrust, pricing, privacy protection, food safety, product quality and taxes. It went ahead with its New York IPO regardless. Punishing the company right after its listing looks like deliberate retaliation for pressing on before the regulators were done with their probing, says Angela Zhang of the University of Hong Kong. Didi's new public investors were badly burnt as a result, just as the private investors in Ant Group were in November, when the financial-technology firm's $37bn IPO was suspended two days before its shares were due to begin trading in Hong Kong and Shanghai.All this is chilling both Chinese firms' appetite for foreign listings and foreign investors' hunger for Chinese stocks, and not just in America. The day after the Didi ban the four biggest tech groups with listings in Hong Kong\\u2014Tencent, Alibaba (which has a dual listing), Meituan and Kuaishou\\u2014lost a collective $60bn in market capitalisation. The effects on some of the world's most innovative and value-generating companies of the past decade may be crippling, especially in conjunction with greater scrutiny of Chinese companies by America's government.American regulators have long sought to force Chinese companies listed on America's bourses to submit auditing documents to an oversight body called the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In December Congress passed a law that would require such disclosures with bipartisan support. At the same time, Chinese regulators have refused to permit Chinese companies to make such disclosures, declaring auditing documents to be state secrets. If the standoff does not ease, Chinese groups could eventually be forced to delist from America.So far there is no sign of easing. Before Didi's IPO, Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, called on America's Securities and Exchange Commission to block the transaction. He fumed that the flotation 'funnels desperately needed US dollars into Beijing and puts the investments of American retirees at risk'. This week he called the decision to let the IPO go ahead 'reckless and irresponsible'. President Joe Biden is less strident but his Democratic Party also wants to curb China's economic and technological might.As the symbiotic relationship between Chinese firms and American investors unravels, both will suffer. The former are losing access to the world's deepest capital markets, the latter to some of its hottest stocks. The market value of Chinese firms in America has fallen by 6% since the Ant debacle last autumn signalled a shift of mood in Beijing, even as the S&P 500 index of big firms has gained 30% as a whole. Didi won't be the last casualty. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline \\\"In the grip of anxiety\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"HOW SHOULD societies punish those who commit the worst crimes? As fewer countries use the death penalty, more are imposing life sentences. The number of people jailed for life worldwide rose by more than 80% between 2000 and 2014, to nearly half a million.And a good thing, too, liberals and conservatives might agree. As a punishment for heinous crimes, life in prison strikes many as a sensible compromise between the inhumanity of the death penalty and the leniency of letting the guilty eventually walk free. The success of that argument is one reason why fewer people are now being put to death.In fact, life sentences can also count as acts of punitive excess. They keep people penned up long after most of them have lost the capacity or inclination to be violent. They are also a poor deterrent. Potential criminals are more effectively restrained by a high likelihood of being caught than by a severe punishment.Although, in America at least, it is cheaper to lock people up for life than to execute them (because death-row cases involve endless legal wrangling), old codgers make costly prisoners, because of their health problems. By one estimate, they are three times more expensive than younger inmates. Money spent keeping 60- and 70-year-old ex-thugs behind bars for ever would nearly always prevent more crimes if it were spent instead on better policing, or on rehabilitation.Life sentences take many forms, of varying severity. Critics should focus on the substance, not the label. Sentences that offer no possibility of parole are far harsher than those that offer a chance of release, however distant. Some ultra-long sentences, by contrast, are no different from life. Alaska does not impose life sentences, but it does jail people for 99 years.Those who want to limit prison terms should start with the cruellest and most egregious. These include sentences imposed on children, or for non-violent crimes, as under 'three strikes' laws in some American states. Lifers should not be singled out for harsh treatment as they are in Ukraine, where some are locked in their cells for 23 hours a day. Nor should life sentences be mandatory for particular offences, which bars courts from taking into account any mitigating circumstances.What about when crimes are shockingly depraved or cost many lives? The judge who sentenced Brenton Tarrant for murdering 51 people in 2019 at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, a country that abolished the death penalty in 1989, had no qualms about throwing away the key. 'Your crimes are so wicked that even if you are detained until you die, it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment,' he told Mr Tarrant.That view is understandable. And yet even in this case life without the possibility of parole is wrong. No amount of time can expiate Mr Tarrant's crimes. But prisons are about harm prevention, not expiation.A better approach is that of Norway. It sets a maximum sentence of 21 years. However, if a convict is still judged to be a danger to society after that time, he can be detained until he is not. Such a rule protects potential victims while also offering the criminal a measure of hope and a reason to reform.Keep the keysIn 2013 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that all prisoners are entitled to the prospect of eventual release. For a few who remain dangerous in their dotage, such as orchestrators of genocide, that may be too big a risk. But for most murderers, 20-25 years behind bars will prove long enough. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Pointlessly punitive\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"Global growth is coming back fast. But the recovery from the pandemic is uneven and fragile | Leaders\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"THE PANDEMIC caused a fearsome economic slump, but now a weird, exhilarating boom is in full swing. The oil price has soared, while restaurants and haulage firms are having to fight and flatter to recruit staff. As listed firms signal that profits will hit an all-time high this year, stockmarkets are on a tear. An index produced by JPMorgan Chase and IHS Markit suggests that global growth is at its highest since the exuberant days of 2006.Any escape from covid-19 is a cause for celebration. But today's booming economy is also a source of anxiety, because three fault lines lie beneath the surface. Together, they will determine who prospers, and whether the most unusual recovery in living memory can be sustained.The first fault line divides the jabs from the jab-nots. Only those countries getting vaccinations into arms will be able to tame covid-19. That is the condition for shops, bars and offices to reopen permanently, and customers and workers to have the confidence to leave their homes. But only one in four people around the world has had a first dose of vaccine and only one in eight is fully protected. Even in America some under-vaccinated states are vulnerable to the infectious Delta variant of the virus.The second fault line runs between supply and demand. Shortages of microchips have disrupted the manufacture of electronics and cars just when consumers want to binge on them. The cost of shipping goods from China to ports on America's west coast has quadrupled from its pre-pandemic level. Even as these bottlenecks are unblocked, newly open economies will create fresh imbalances. In some countries people seem keener to go for a drink than they do to work behind the bar, causing a structural labour shortage in the service sector. House prices have surged, suggesting that rents will soon start to rise, too. That could sustain inflation and deepen the sense that housing is unaffordable.The final fault line is over the withdrawal of stimulus. At some point, the state interventions that began last year must be reversed. Rich-world central banks have bought assets worth over $10trn since the pandemic began and are nervously considering how to extricate themselves without causing a flap in capital markets by tightening too fast. China, whose economy did not shrink in 2020, offers a sign of what is to come: it has tightened credit policy this year, slowing its growth.Meanwhile, emergency government-aid schemes, such as unemployment-insurance top-ups and eviction moratoriums, are beginning to expire. Households are unlikely to get a fresh infusion of 'stimmies' in 2022. Deficits will contract rather than expand, dragging down growth. So far, economies have largely avoided a wave of damaging bankruptcies but nobody knows how well firms will cope once emergency loans come due and workers can no longer be furloughed at taxpayers' expense.You might think that an event as extreme as a pandemic, combined with the unprecedented government response to it, would eventually trigger an equally extreme global economic reaction. Pessimists worry about a return to 1970s-style inflation, or a financial crash, or that capitalism's underlying energy will be drained by state handouts. Such apocalyptic outcomes are possible, but they are not likely. Instead a better way to think about the unusual outlook is to examine how the three fault lines interact differently in different economies.Start with America. With abundant vaccines and enormous stimulus, it is at the biggest risk of overheating. In recent months inflation has reached levels not seen since the early 1980s. Its labour market is coming under strain as economic activity shifts. Even after a rise of 850,000 in the number of jobs in June and accounting for abundant vacancies, the number of people working in leisure and hospitality is 12% lower than before the pandemic. Workers are reluctant to return to the industry, which has pushed up wages. Hourly pay is almost 8% higher than in February 2020. Perhaps they will come back when emergency unemployment benefits expire in September. But countries without such a scheme, like Australia, are also seeing a labour shortage. Attitudes to work may be changing at the bottom of the income spectrum, among waiters and cleaners, not just among well-heeled professionals who dream of yachts and sabbaticals. All this suggests that America's economy will run hot, with continual pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten policy.Elsewhere in the rich world the picture is less exuberant. It includes some jab-nots, like Japan, which has fully vaccinated less than 15% of its population. Europe is catching up on vaccines, but its smaller stimulus means that inflation has not reached American levels. In Britain, France and Switzerland 8-13% of employees remained on furlough schemes at the end of May. In all these economies the risk is that policymakers overreact to temporary, imported inflation, withdrawing support too quickly. If so, their economies will suffer, just as the euro area suffered after the financial crisis of 2007-09.Low- and middle-income countries are in a bind. They should be benefiting from surging global demand for commodities and factory goods, but they are struggling. Indonesia, battling another covid-19 wave, is redeploying oxygen from industry to hospitals. In 2021 the poorest countries, which are desperately short of vaccines, are forecast to grow more slowly than rich countries for only the third time in 25 years.Even as covid-19 weakens their recoveries, emerging markets face the prospect of higher interest rates at the Fed. That tends to put downward pressure on their currencies as investors buy dollars, raising the risk of financial instability. Their central banks do not have the luxury of ignoring temporary or imported inflation. Brazil, Mexico and Russia have raised interest rates recently, and more places may follow. The combination of jabbing too late and tightening too soon will be painful.Prepare to take shelterThe economic cycle has been frantic, leaving the slump far behind in only a year. Perhaps by the summer of 2022 most people will be vaccinated, business will have adapted to new patterns of demand and stimulus will be unwinding in an orderly way. In this weird boom, however, beware those fault lines. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Fault lines in the world economy\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"One of China's odder sights is tourists in replica Red Army uniforms. A visit to the villages where they are made | China\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"FIVE OR SIX years ago, when many Chinese still associated American culture with novelty and fun, Halloween was big business in Caoxian. This rural county claims to be China's largest source of cheap costumes for children's parties and school concerts as well as for dramatic galas that are sometimes staged in Chinese workplaces, from small factories to government ministries. Not long ago, Caoxian's entrepreneurs could live for a year on one month's sales of pumpkin costumes, witches' robes and other Halloween paraphernalia, says Ren Yafeng, a local costume merchant, perhaps exaggerating just a little.In the past three years, however, America's image has darkened and consumers have become more nationalistic, nudged by Communist Party propaganda and four years of Trumpian bluster. The market signals were swiftly received in Caoxian, for this light manufacturing hub in the eastern province of Shandong is linked to customers by e-commerce. Officials in Mr Ren's home village, Sunzhuang, report that almost three-quarters of households sell goods on such online platforms as Taobao, 1688 and Pinduoduo.This month marks the 100th anniversary of the party's founding. All year, orders have poured in to Caoxian for replicas of the Red Army uniforms that were worn by Communist guerrillas. Schools have been buying child-sized ones for more than a decade, for use in performances. But it is not only children who don them. Such costumes are now all-but-required wearing for groups visiting party-approved 'red tourism' sites, such as bases used during the Long March and battlefields where the Communists suffered ghastly but inspiring losses. Since January Mr Ren has shipped 100,000 Red Army uniforms from his warehouse, located at a crossroads between cornfields and a duck pond. He hopes to sell the same number again before the year is out.The sight of grown men and women dressed as soldiers from the 1930s, in powder-blue or grey tunics, trousers and octagonal caps bearing a red star on the peak, is one of the spectacles of modern China. They can be seen panting up Red Army supply trails in Jinggangshan, a mountain in southern China called the cradle of the revolution. They can be heard reciting Mao's poems in Yan'an, an old party headquarters, and singing red hymns around vats of thin soup that troops might have eaten long ago. These are pilgrims, for the party, though atheist, unabashedly talks about 'sacred' sites, 'martyrs' and filling hearts with revolutionary fire. The costumes are an aid to faith. Official documents talk of tourists being inspired by 'wearing Red Army clothes, eating Red Army meals and walking Red Army paths'. Some visitors are bureaucrats on government-paid study tours, or workers from private firms eager to show loyalty to the party. Commercial guides also rent out or sell uniforms to individual tourists. Devotion to authenticity varies, with some visitors pairing uniforms with trainers and plastic bags full of modern-day snacks. Those attentive to detail sport old-fashioned cloth slippers, canvas satchels and toy guns.Children's costumes still make up most of Mr Ren's sales, but adult orders are booming. The cheapest Red Army suits sell for 25 yuan ($3.90) while more durable uniforms can go for 100 yuan, including a belt and cap. He reports seeing a first surge in 2015, the 70th anniversary of victory over Japan, and ever-growing orders from revolutionary bases in the past two or three years.Especially last year, when covid-19 lockdowns forced the cancellation of performances, lots of Caoxian's costume-makers diversified into another patriotic fashion, selling the supposedly ancient robes known as Hanfu to individual buyers. These floaty gowns and tunics are largely invented, based on a mishmash of historical styles. Still, they are embraced by many Han Chinese, who make up over 90% of the population. They had lacked an ethnic costume they could call their own, unlike Tibetans or other minorities. Even children's costumes are becoming more patriotic. Those based on 'Journey to the West', a famous folk saga, are brisk sellers, as are some based on a cartoon series from the 1980s about seven brothers born from magic gourds. In Sunzhuang locals call national pride a sign of progress, suggesting that as the Chinese grow richer and no longer worry about their next meal, their minds are turning to 'higher things', such as their own history. The village party secretary, Sun Xueping, used to encourage locals to seek jobs as migrant workers. Now he urges them to stay and make more money selling goods online. If those products reflect love of the country and party, 'that's a win-win', he beams.Red tourism, golden opportunitiesDown the lane from Mr Ren's warehouse, a line of beige uniform trousers drying next to a stack of corn cobs reveals a still more specialised business. Through a farmhouse gate lies a backyard workshop employing a dozen people to make costumes worn by enemy troops decades ago. Inside, workbenches are heaped with caps bearing the blue-and-white insignia of the Nationalist regime, which the Red Army overthrew in 1949. Boxes hold the black-and-white uniforms of Nationalist police, who hunted down underground Communists in Shanghai and other cities. These are used by extras in videos or stage shows, guesses the workshop's owner, Ren Gen. He only receives orders for adult sizes, perhaps because parents do not want children playing villains.It is revealing that blue or grey uniforms from the party's earliest decades dominate the replica trade. There is less demand for the green uniforms worn in Mao's later years, including by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution in 1966-76. In Caoxian, as elsewhere, that dark period saw temples smashed and people with the wrong class background, or even a slender connection to the outside world, tortured by mobs. 'People don't really want to mention such things,' says an older local who remembers those horrors. Nostalgia is both party-approved and profitable in today's China. It is also selective.\\u25a0This article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline \\\"For-profit patriotism\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"Mitt Romney compared the election conspiracy to pro wrestling. This was perhaps truer than he realised | United States\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"POLITICIANS EXAGGERATE, but understatement is a rarer quality. When in June Mitt Romney witheringly likened the conspiracy theory that last year's presidential election was stolen to professional wrestling, the Republican senator from Utah might not have realised quite how apt the comparison is. Wrestling and conspiracy theories have much in common. Both tell improbable stories of cartoon villains and larger-than-life heroes. Convoluted but compelling plot lines are woven together to create a world of drama and intrigue more engaging than humdrum reality. They even share some of the same cast.Big names from the past, such as Val Venis and Chris Jericho, have become enthusiastic conspiracy theorists. Given how many chairs to the head wrestlers take over a career, perhaps this is not surprising. And some have stepped into politics. Jesse 'The Body' Ventura, a wrestler and former governor of Minnesota, once hosted a TV show investigating claims that the CIA had been turning citizens into assassins with hypnosis, and that oil companies caused the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 to profit from the clean-up. Alex Jones, the founder of Infowars, an internet purveyor of bogus conspiracy theories and useless supplements, was a frequent guest. The show's co-host for a time was June Sarpong, later director of creative diversity at the BBC, Britain's public broadcaster.Occasionally wrestlers' conspiratorial beliefs seep out into the real world. In 2013, immediately after the Boston Marathon bombing, Governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts was asked at a press conference if the attack was a 'false flag', conspiracy-theorist lingo for an operation deliberately designed to implicate an innocent party. The questioner was 'Bionic' Dan Bidondi, an Infowars 'reporter' and semi-pro wrestler. In May World Wrestling Entertainment cut ties with Drake Wuertz, a referee. His conspiratorial beliefs had received some attention in the sport's press, but become impossible to ignore when he berated a Florida school board over its mask mandate with a passion usually reserved for the ring, saying it 'plays into the hands' of child sex-traffickers.The two worlds also share an omert\\u00e0-like code. Wrestlers' commitment to 'kayfabe', the imperative never to break character in case it ruptures the suspension of disbelief, occasionally borders on ludicrous. The Wild Samoans, a tag-team duo, were travelling with fellow wrestler Terry 'Hulk Hogan' Bollea when a state trooper discovered Mr Bollea's unregistered firearm. According to wrestling lore the Wild Samoans said nothing\\u2014their characters did not speak English, so neither would they.Mr Jones, whose show once hosted Donald Trump (himself a participant in Wrestlemania 23), seems to live by a similar code. In a hearing over the custody of his children, his lawyer suggested that his rants about the deep state and 9/11 should be discounted as evidence because he was really a 'performance artist'. His lawyer might out him, but Mr Jones would never break kayfabe. His credibility and livelihood depend on it.This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Wrestling with common sense\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"IN NORMAL YEARS, on Trinity Sunday (eight weeks after Easter), thousands of denizens of the Belgian city of Mons chase an enormous plastic dragon around the town square until a local, dressed as St George, arrives on a horse and kills it. The procession, known as the Ducasse de Mons or simply Doudou, originated in the 14th century to celebrate the end of an outbreak of plague. But for the past two years the Doudou has been cancelled by a new plague, along with most of Europe's traditional carnivals and festivals.This summer, with vaccinations beginning to tame covid-19, the continent's folk gatherings are coming back to life. In June Swedes staged scaled-back versions of their Midsommar solstice celebrations. (Unlike the film of the same name these did not involve tossing old people off cliffs, though parliament did toss out the prime minister.) In Norway the Sami, an indigenous Scandinavian people, will hold their annual Riddu Riddu art and music festival, this time with new additions such as a seminar on sexuality. The village of Goudelin, in Brittany, plans to resume its peculiar mid-July practice of driving its horses into a pond and baptising them.Many festivals have roots in Christian or pagan rites, as with the festa major of Vilafranca in Catalonia in late August, which honours the town's patron, St Felix. Why his celebration should involve the world's biggest human-tower competition is not clear. Others have lost their religious connections. Manresa, just up the road from Vilafranca, ended its August procession of holy relics (bits of saints' bodies) decades ago, replacing it with a street carnival involving costumed demons and fireworks.Such customs give people a sense of belonging. More prosaically, they bring in tourists. They are also often linked to politics. The Lemko Watra, a festival in July devoted to the music and culture of southern Poland's Lemko minority, got started in the 1980s, when celebrating ethnic traditions was one of the few types of cultural non-conformism that the communist regime tolerated. Similarly, Soviet Ukraine preserved its summer-solstice festivals, called Ivan Kupalo, and its weirdly shrill folk music. That hypnotic traditional vocal style helped Go_A, a Ukrainian group, win the second-most audience votes this spring at Europe's biggest annual folk gathering of all: the Eurovision Song Contest.This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline \\\"After the plague, the revelry\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"TO BE MAYOR of New York City is no easy task. Bill de Blasio, the departing incumbent, was once a progressive darling. However, his unique political talents\\u2014a penchant for self-aggrandisement and a smug disdain for dealing with the city's problems\\u2014along with constant bickering with the governor, rendered Mr de Blasio ineffectual and widely loathed. He will soon be limping out of Gracie Mansion, leaving behind some daunting problems for his successor. Economic growth is choked by regulation and insufficient house-building. There has been a dramatic increase in shootings and homicides. Were it not for a timely federal bail-out, the city would be facing severe cuts to its budget.Listen to this storyYour browser does not support the element.Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.The man New Yorkers will choose to pick up these pieces is Eric Adams, a black, vegan, ex-police captain from Brooklyn. In a crowded field, Mr Adams narrowly won the Democratic primary with support from a broad coalition of non-white, non-Manhattanites. As with President Joe Biden, his supporters were the working class, the elderly and minorities. He promises to be mayor for the Bronx and Brooklyn, not the Upper West Side.His victory in the primary election, and almost guaranteed triumph in the general one to come, is a rebuke to the progressive zeal that has overtaken America's largest cities since racial-justice protests began more than a year ago. This is a growing movement that is almost contemptuous of the industries that generate urban prosperity. It sees specialised schooling for gifted pupils as oppressive; it interprets pathological housing markets as signs of too little governmental interference rather than too much; and it argues, in contradiction of common sense and political reality, that 'defunding the police' is the solution to rising crime. Its most enthusiastic adherents seem to be citizens comfortably insulated from both violence and from need.Mr Adams is not their avatar. A former cop himself, he wants neither to defund nor abolish the police department, but to reform it. Even before his run for office, Mr Adams had been agitating to make it easier for officers who brutalised citizens to be sacked. But he resists the patronising attitude, adopted by some progressives, that resurgent violent crime visited largely upon the poor is an acceptable trade-off on the path to social justice.Rather than increase the city's budget by 25% in real terms, as Mr de Blasio did, Mr Adams has plans to trim its expansive bureaucracy. He says he wants to repeat the $1.5bn reduction in spending that Michael Bloomberg managed while he was mayor.The problem of high-cost cities largely reflects a lack of housing\\u2014something that no 'rent stabilisation' scheme, however elaborate, can paper over. From 2010 to 2019, for every five new jobs created in New York, only one new unit of housing was built. Mr Adams is right to say that new development must be rapidly approved in the city\\u2014and that the burden of change should be borne not just by poor neighbourhoods but also by posh ones like the charming, absurdly low-slung West Village.It is folly to place too much faith in anyone who aims to run America's largest city. Even Mr de Blasio once mustered some enthusiasm. Mr Bloomberg's admirable technocratic impulses got him mired in unending debates over taxes on fizzy drinks.Unfortunately, Mr Adams's judgment also has its flaws. The rumour that he lives part-time in New Jersey did not die even after he let the press tour his sparse townhouse. Incorrect financial filings do not inspire confidence in a man who is about to take over a $100bn operation. As a machine politician, he owes many people many favours. Alarmingly, during his campaign, he labelled an alliance between two of his opponents in the primary an attempt to suppress black votes in the city\\u2014a cheap, false and incendiary attack.Getting New York back on track will require sustained and skilful leadership, not hollow displays of populism. Gotham has already endured enough of those. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \\\"New cop on the beat\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"PROPAGANDISTS HAD teed it up as one of this year's blockbusters. The film '1921', named after the year China's Communist Party was born, was intended to grip the imaginations of young people with the story of the party's founding 100 years ago this month. Mao Zedong would be played by different actors depending on his age in the scene depicted. One of them would be Yan Xujia, a 19-year-old pop star who frequently appears on reality television. In mid-May the heartthrob's profile appeared on promotional posters against an orange-yellow background, suggesting the dawn of Chinese communism (see picture).Yan Xujia, briefly the party's poster boyBut a few months before the film's release on July 1st, reports appeared on entertainment news sites that Mr Yan had cheated on a girlfriend. He denied this, but disbelieving internet users said he was unfit to play a character as important and upstanding as Mao. Some directed their ire at the main producer of '1921': Tencent Pictures, a production house owned by a privately run social-media and gaming giant. They accused it of involvement in a capitalist conspiracy to smear the party's most revered founder. 'Mao must be portrayed as great and glorious. He must not be besmirched,' read one popular comment.These posts must have stung officials at the party's Publicity Department, which was closely involved in making the film (with the help of one of the country's most famous directors, Huang Jianxin). Earlier this year the law had been amended to make insulting, slandering or infringing on the memory of national heroes punishable by up to three years in jail. Never mind that Mao was a zealous philanderer while he was married. (Mao's private physician, Li Zhisui, provided lurid details of this in his book 'The Private Life of Chairman Mao', which was published in 1994 shortly before Mr Li's death.) No mention is allowed in China of such matters.The film has not been a sensation. In its first five days it grossed 300m yuan ($46.3m), one third of the amount earned in a comparable period by 'Fast and Furious 9' (or 'F9: The Fast Saga' as it is known in America) after the Hollywood action movie was released in China in May. And audiences noticed that Mr Yan was missing. In one telling scene, Mao is chased through a forest by his parents, but does not appear himself. Online articles about Mr Yan being cut were deleted by censors.As the party increasingly turns to celebrities for help with spreading its message, their private lives are likely to be subjected to ever greater scrutiny. Yet the stars know they have little choice but to play along with the cultural commissars. At midnight on July 1st, a message posted on Weibo, China's answer to Twitter, by state television said 'We will forever walk with the party! Best wishes to our great party!' Hundreds of popular actors, singers and other celebrities quickly shared the post. Their fans followed suit. Within 12 hours, the message had been forwarded 15m times.Without celebrities' support, state media would struggle to strike such a chord. The Weibo account of People's Daily, the party's main mouthpiece, has about 130m followers. That is about the same as the number who follow Xie Na, an actress and television host. Celebrities' accounts on Weibo have more than 21bn followers, almost twice as many as in 2017, the platform says. The majority of these fans are 26 or younger. And they are widely scattered: almost 90% do not live in the biggest cities.But the party's attempts to boost its ratings among the celebrities' armies of admirers are fraught with difficulty. Officials might give the limelight to one heart-throb, such as Mr Yan, only to find that jealous fans of another idol take umbrage and try to undermine the reputation of the party's chosen one. Mr Yan may have been the victim of such an onslaught. 'The filmmakers succumbed to pressure from fans of other actors who went crazy reporting and exaggerating Yan's immorality,' says one Chinese film critic. Mao once said that Marxists should not be afraid of criticism from any quarter. That is poor advice for China's entertainment stars. \\u25a0This article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline \\\"De-Maoification\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"THE SPECTACLE of the SPAC, or 'special-purpose acquisition company', has preoccupied bankers on Wall Street over the past year. This is in part because the vehicles, which list a shell company on stockmarkets and raise a pot of capital before hunting for a private company to merge with, are often touted by their backers as an alternative to an initial public offering (IPO). Big banks make meaty fees from their IPO businesses. For some, the fact that SPACs have muscled in is an unwelcome development. As voracious buyers of private firms, though, SPACs are attracting as much attention among the private-equity (PE) barons on New York's Park Avenue as on Wall Street.Since the start of 2020 SPACs have gobbled up almost $200bn in capital. The way they are constructed makes them prone to overpaying for firms. Creators see no compensation unless they strike a deal with a merger target, which must often be done within two years. The founders' payoff is usually 20% of the shares the SPAC helps issue in the newly public firm, which are given to them for a nominal fee. This means that even if the shares plunge after the shell company merges with its target, the founders are still well compensated. Their incentive is thus to do any deal they can, at lofty prices if necessary.This tendency to overpay is both a blessing and a curse for PE. If a PE firm is looking to offload one of its portfolio companies, then finding a SPAC to buy it is an attractive prospect. In March Blackstone and CVC Capital Partners, two PE shops, tripled their money when they sold Paysafe, a payments platform, through a SPAC merger led by Bill Foley, an insurance executive. After Blackstone achieved record first-quarter earnings of $1.75bn Jon Gray, its president, noted on an earnings call that SPACs had emerged as a new exit option.But PE firms also need to purchase private companies for their new funds, ideally at low valuations if they are to make the juicy returns their investors have come to expect. Little is known publicly about the deals that PE firms miss out on, but reports abound of SPACs bidding 20-50% more for companies than the most optimistic valuations by analysts in PE shops.A further complication in the relationship between blank-cheque vehicles and PE is that some PE giants are setting up SPACs themselves. Apollo, for instance, has launched five in recent years. That could pose a dilemma: should a target firm be bought through the private arm, to the benefit of the investors in the PE fund, or by the public arm, to the benefit of the investors in the SPAC? The SPAC frenzy might yield juicy returns for PE investors who bought into a fund a decade ago. But tricky choices loom.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Frenemies\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"Hundreds of thousands are dead, partly thanks to the Kremlin's incompetence | Europe\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"FOR THE past year the Kremlin has trumpeted its success in fighting covid-19. It eschewed lockdowns and hailed its home-grown Sputnik V vaccine. In early June, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, boasted to thousands of guests at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, billed as the world's largest post-pandemic international gathering, that 'the current situation in Russia allows us to hold such events without any particular risk of spreading the infection.'In fact, by the time Mr Putin was addressing his powwow, Russian doctors had for several weeks been registering an alarming rise in infections and deaths. A month later, Russia is in the midst of its third and most severe wave of covid-19, with more people dying daily than at any point during the pandemic (see chart).The number of new daily cases is currently around 25,000, somewhat fewer than in Britain, and rising. But whereas in Britain this surge has translated into an average of 18 daily deaths over the past week, in Russia it has resulted in an average of 670 deaths a day.The contrast is all the more striking because Russia was the first country in the world to approve a working vaccine, one based on the same science as the British-Swedish AstraZeneca one and apparently just as effective. But whereas in Britain 78% of the population has received at least one jab, in Russia the proportion is only 20%. The difference is not the availability or the efficacy of the jab, but people's trust in the government and its vaccines.All of this could have been avoided. A year ago the government decided to lift a partial lockdown (Mr Putin called it 'a holiday'), hoping to save itself money and to prop up the president's faltering popularity after a prolonged slump in incomes. Mr Putin's ratings did go back up\\u2014but so did the risk of infection.As the second wave hit Europe in late autumn last year, the Kremlin chose not to spend money on supporting people and businesses through a new lockdown. It left people to their own devices, playing down the risks, with Mr Putin boasting about the contrast between lifeless European cities and Moscow, where restaurants, theatres and shops stayed open.But the numbers lied. By February 2021 Russia had one of the world's highest excess mortality rates, according to numbers compiled by The Economist. At that point it had registered 460,000 more deaths than normal, while its official covid-19 death toll was a more modest 85,000. But by in effect removing all restrictions and fiddling the numbers, the government managed to create a false sense of security.This was just when people should have been urged to get vaccinated, says Denis Volkov of the Levada Centre, an independent pollster. Despite the staggering true number of deaths, in February his polling found that 57% of people were not worried about catching the virus. Most worryingly, two-thirds of the country rejected the idea of getting vaccinated.The government, meanwhile, had other priorities, such as jailing Alexei Navalny, the most prominent opposition figure, and crushing street protests. This is where social-distancing rules came in handy. Mr Navalny's associates were put under house arrest for 'urging the public to violate epidemiological restrictions'. At the same time Mr Putin packed 80,000 people into the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow for a ceremony to mark the seventh anniversary of the annexation of Crimea.Many Russians concluded that the rules were merely a government ploy, to be evaded like so many of its prescriptions. They took a similarly dismissive view of the Sputnik V vaccine after its launch, with much fanfare, in early December.Sputnik V was authorised before the results of its phase-3 clinical trials were ready. Once these were published, questions were raised about some inconsistencies and data availability, says Boris Reizis, a professor of immunology at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine. Still, he says, the data suggest that Sputnik V is at least as safe and effective as other adenovirus-based vaccines, such as those made by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. But the damage had been done.To be sure, confidence in vaccines is fragile everywhere. But in Russia nobody has done more to undermine such confidence than the Kremlin and its loyal, conspiracy-peddling media. Mr Putin has hijacked Sputnik V for the purpose of geopolitical point-scoring. Yet he dithered with his own vaccination until the end of March and refused to be photographed being injected, despite his usual penchant for bare-chested publicity stunts. He has also suggested that vaccines from other countries are unsafe.That has done little to reassure the many Russians who expect their government to lie to them. They have good reason: it turns out that some people who were told they were getting Sputnik V were in fact given EpiVacCorona, another Russian vaccine praised by Mr Putin, but about which there are serious concerns. Hardly any countries have approved it.Failing to win trust, Russian authorities are resorting to sticks and carrots. In Moscow, restaurants and caf\\u00e9s are allowed to serve people indoors only if they have a QR code proving they have been vaccinated. Hospitals refuse routine treatment to anyone without a jab. Public-sector and service workers have been ordered to get vaccinated. But although more people are now signing up for jabs, there is a side-effect: a thriving black market for fake vaccination certificates, QR codes and medical exemptions. None of this bodes well for hospitals across the country, as the numbers continue to mount. \\u25a0Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub. You can also find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines, excess deaths by country and the virus's spread across Europe and America.This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline \\\"How not to do it\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"VATICAN SCANDALS are nothing if not colourful. The latest involves claims of extortion, a kidnapped nun, and a security expert alleged to have frittered prodigious amounts of the Holy See's money on luxury goods and services.On July 3rd a Vatican judge sent ten people, including a cardinal, Angelo Becciu, for trial on charges including embezzlement, abuse of office, extortion and fraud. All deny wrongdoing. The news was overshadowed by the following day's announcement that Pope Francis was undergoing an operation to remove part of his colon. But it is the trial, due to open on July 27th, that is likely to leave a more enduring mark on his pontificate.Cardinal Becciu had been the second most powerful official in the Holy See's bureaucracy, as deputy secretary of state, a friend of Francis and once seen as his possible successor. Among his fellow defendants are the former president and director of the Vatican's financial regulator. The indictments suggest Francis will spare no one in his determination to cleanse the Vatican's murky finances. But they also raise questions about his methods.The prosecutors have wound three strands into one trial. The first, which prompted the cardinal's dismissal last year, relates to his payment of \\u20ac100,000 ($118,000) to a diocesan co-operative run by his brother. The second concerns his relationship with Cecilia Marogna, whom he hired as a consultant and into whose firm his office allegedly funnelled \\u20ac575,000. The money was meant for operations that included securing the release of a nun kidnapped in Colombia. The prosecution says much of the cash was spent at places like Prada and Louis Vuitton and in spas.Central to this tangled skein is a property deal. Cardinal Becciu is alleged to have inspired the Secretariat of State's investment of \\u20ac350m in a commercial property in London. Structured in a highly complex way, the money was invested through a fund operated by a London-based Italian financier who is among those charged. The secretariat, using money largely donated by the faithful, originally took a minority stake. But, dissatisfied with the arrangement, it decided in 2018 to buy the entire property, and turned to another Italian intermediary, Gianluigi Torzi, who pocketed a \\u20ac15m fee the Vatican's prosecutors claim was extorted. The Vatican's financial regulator, which became involved in negotiating with Mr Torzi, is accused of exceeding its remit and failing to report the transaction to the prosecutors.Whether it is wise to put regulators on trial is one worry. Another is whether the defendants can get a fair hearing: their lawyers were given just 24 days to respond to a 487-page charge-sheet. A third is whether the Vatican is shifting the blame. According to Mr Torzi, the pope knew of his involvement; and that his right-hand man, the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, approved it. Tricky, your Holiness. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Vatican rocked\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

Murmurations are a phenomenon when hundreds to thousands of starlings can be observed flying in intricately coordinated patterns. After months of failed attempts, pals James Crombie and Colin Hogg captured a perfect picture of the magical event over Lough Ennell in County Westmeath. In a video shared on YouTube by Hogg, Crombie can be heard exclaiming \\\"that looked like a bird,\\\" as tens of thousands of starlings swooped over the water: Crombie, who was named press photographer of the year at last week's Press Photographers Association of Ireland awards, tweeted that he and Hogg had spent \\\"an amazing few months chasing the murmurations and our patience eventually paid off.\\\" What an amazing few months it has been chasing the murmurations around Lough Ennell looking for the shot with @hogg82, our patience eventually paid off. Thanks so much to the @IrishTimes for the wonderful usage today pic.twitter.com/5ldPF6J6PS \\u2014 James Crombie (@INPHOjames) March 4, 2021\\n The magical murmuration picture is now for sale via Inpho, where Crombie works as a photographer. Crombie told The Irish Times that his pal Hogg, who lives near Lough Ennell, mentioned last year that the starlings would make for a great picture. \\\"They nest in the reeds around the lake, and they move every four or five days, towards sunset,\\\" Crombie said, \\\"and when they move they make shapes.' The picture, however, required a great deal of patience. Speaking with The Irish Examiner, Crombie said: \\\"I kept failing. I kept missing them. They'd be in another part of the lake, or it would be raining or it would be foggy. 'We went nearly 50 times and I kept persisting saying \\u2018no, I'm going again.' 'I'd be in Galway working [as a press photographer] and I'd drive back down to the lake just as [the murmuration] was finished. \\\"I kept hammering away at it and eventually, we got it. I never expected the shot to be so perfect.\\\" Hogg, himself an amateur photographer who works in the geophysics section at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, told RTE that it was \\\"a wonderful sight, so close to home.\\\" * Originally published in March 2021.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Over the Fourth of July weekend, viewers settled into the new Netflix series\\u00a0Sex/Life, which is largely about sex, less so about life. But as the series moves forward, there is one scene in particular that has captured the collective attention of the internet. No need to dangle the fruit any longer because, if you've seen the scene, you know there's already been enough dangling for a lifetime. It's a penis. A gigantic penis. A penis so big that it's offensive in scope.\\nThe series follows an impossibly attractive woman named Billie, as she navigates the extramarital affair she's keeping from her impossibly attractive husband, Cooper. There's a lot of sex and a smattering of plot. To make matters worse, she's having said affair with her impossibly attractive ex-boyfriend, Brad, who has a penis that could put some tape measurers out of business. In episode three, the penis gets the full reveal as both men go into the gym shower to wash away the stifling masculine pheromones that follow a day of pumping iron. It's there that Brad's giant dick makes its debut. He turns around, and it's just like\\u00a0bam.\\u00a0It's a penis you can never unsee.\\nIf none of that impresses you much, Shania Twain, then the real\\u00a0pi\\u00e8ce de r\\u00e9sistance\\u00a0is that apparently, this is actor Adam Demos' real penis, which means that we're not dealing with a Loch Ness Monster situation. There are real penises like that out there that are lurking in nature. Logistically, there are too many questions, so instead, let's focus on the general shock and awe expressed on the internet.\\n\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \\n\\n Anyway. The scene is at the 19:30 mark in the episode. Good luck ever sleeping again. Oh, and everyone was made the way we were intended to be made, so be kind to yourself. \\n\\nCONTINUE READING BELOW \\nRecommended Videos \\n \\n\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \\n\\n This story originally appeared on Esquire.com.

I love that any time something random happens, I put it on my body.\\\" The flame-haired pop star is said to have more than 60 tattoos, but the 30-year-old musician admitted he can no longer stand the pain for more than two hours at a time.He added: \\\"In my twenties, I would sit for 18 hours and just blitz it.\\\"Now I'm like two hours in, 'just do it in a month' kinda thing.\\\"However, a few years ago, the Bloodstream hitmaker was so comfortable in the tattooist chair that he fell asleep.Ed got Kevin Paul to create a collage of inkings on his chest in 2016 and he spent over 40 hours in the chair to get his unique collection.The Grammy-winner had confessed that he \\\"passed out\\\" when he was getting an image of the Sagrada Familia, an elaborate Roman Catholic church in Barcelona, etched onto his stomach because the pain was so excruciating. Despite his admission, Kevin insisted that out of all his celebrity clients Ed was the most \\\"hardcore\\\" when it comes to taking the needle and he even dozed off for a short snooze as he was marking his skin witha design.Kevin - who has worked on a host of stars such as Rihanna, Harry Styles and James Arthur - said at the time: \\\"Ed is amazing for taking the pain.For a little geeky ginger kid - which was what he was like when I first met him - he used to take seven or eight hours at a time, he was proper hardcore he would proper go for it. Nowadays I probably do three or four hours on him at a time. The last time I did a tattoo on him he fell asleep, he was proper snoring, he fell asleep for about 20 minutes!\\\"Ed has had his entire chest covered in tattoos that relate to his loved ones and the songs from his album Divide.\\nListen to the Stacey, Mike, and Anika podcast on iHeartRadio: - Bang!

      "      \"summary\": \"On the face of it, you might think that the QAnon conspiracy has largely disappeared from big social media sites. But that's not quite the case. True, you're much less likely to find popular QAnon catchphrases like 'great awakening', 'the storm' or 'trust the plan' on Facebook these days. Facebook and Twitter have removed tens of thousands of accounts dedicated to the baseless conspiracy theory, which depicts former President Donald Trump as a hero fighting a secret battle against a sect of devil-worshipping paedophiles who dominate Hollywood, big business, the media and government. Gone are the huge 'Stop the Steal' groups that spread falsehoods about the 2020 US presidential elections. Trump is gone as well, banned from Twitter permanently and suspended from posting on Facebook until 2023. But QAnon is far from winding down. Federal intelligence officials recently warned that its adherents could commit more violence, like the deadly Capitol insurrection on Jan 6. At least one open supporter of QAnon has been elected to Congress. In the four years since someone calling themselves 'Q' started posting enigmatic messages on fringe internet discussions boards, QAnon has grown up. That's partly because QAnon now encompasses a variety of conspiracy theories, from evangelical or religious angles to alleged pedophilia in Hollywood and the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, said Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's DFRLab who focuses on domestic extremism. 'Q-specific stuff is sort of dwindling,' he said. But the worldviews and conspiracy theories that QAnon absorbed are still with us. Loosely tying these movements together is a general distrust of a powerful, often leftist elite. Among the purveyors of anti-vaccine falsehoods, adherents of Trump's 'Big Lie' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, and believers in just about any other worldview convinced that a shadowy cabal secretly controls things. For social platforms, dealing with this faceless, shifting and increasingly popular mindset is a far more complicated challenge than they've dealt with in the past. These ideologies 'have cemented their place and now are a part of American folklore', said Max Rizzuto, another researcher at DFRLab. 'I don't think we'll ever see it disappear.' Online, such groups now blend into the background. Where Facebook groups once openly referenced QAnon, you'll now see others like 'Since you missed this in the so called MSM', a reference to the mainstream media. This page boasts more than 4,000 followers who post links to clips of Fox News' Tucker Carlson and links to articles from right-wing publications such as Newsmax and the Daily Wire. Subjects range from allegedly rampant crime to unfounded claims of widespread election fraud and an 'outright war on conservatives'. Such groups aim to draw followers in deeper by directing them to further information on less-regulated sites such as Gab or Parler. When DFRLab analysed more than 40 million appearances of QAnon catchphrases and related terms on social media this spring, it found that their presence on mainstream platforms had declined significantly in recent months. After peaks in the late summer of 2020 and briefly on Jan 6, QAnon catchphrases have largely evaporated from mainstream sites, DFRLab found. So while your friends and relatives might not be posting wild conspiracies about Hillary Clinton drinking children's blood, they might instead be repeating debunked claims such as that vaccines can alter your DNA. There are several reasons for dwindling Q talk \\u2013 Trump losing the presidential election, for instance. But the single biggest factor appears to have been the QAnon crackdown on Facebook and Twitter. Despite well-documented mistakes that revealed spotty enforcement, the banishment largely appears to have worked. It is more difficult to come across blatant QAnon accounts on mainstream social media sites these days, at least from the publicly available data that does not include, for instance, hidden Facebook groups and private messages. But while QAnon groups, pages and core accounts may be gone, many of their supporters remain on the big platforms \\u2013 only now they're camouflaging their language and watering down the most extreme tenets of QAnon to make them more palatable. 'There was a very, very explicit effort within the QAnon community to to camouflage their language,' said Angelo Carusone, the president and CEO of Media Matters, a liberal research group that has followed QAnon's rise. 'So they stopped using a lot of the codes, the triggers, the keywords that were eliciting the kinds of enforcement actions against them.' Other dodges may have also helped. Rather than parroting Q slogans, for instance, for a while earlier this year supporters would type three asterisks next to their name to signal adherence to the conspiracy theory. (That's a nod to former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, a three-star general). Facebook says it has removed about 3,300 pages, 10,500 groups, 510 events, 18,300 Facebook profiles and 27,300 Instagram accounts for violating its policy against QAnon. 'We continue to consult with experts and improve our enforcement in response to how harm evolves, including by recidivist groups,' the company said in a statement. But the social giant will still cut individuals posting about QAnon slack, citing experts who warn that banning individual Q adherents 'may lead to further social isolation and danger', the company said. Facebook's policies and response to QAnon continue to evolve. Since last August, the company says it has added dozens of new terms as the movement and its language has evolved. Twitter, meanwhile, says it has consistently taken action against activity that could lead to offline harm. After the Jan 6 insurrection, the company began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that it said were 'primarily dedicated' to sharing dangerous QAnon material. Twitter said it has suspended 150,000 such accounts to date. Like Facebook, the company says its response is also evolving. But the crackdown may have come too late. Carusone, for instance, noted that Facebook banned QAnon groups tied to violence six weeks before it banned QAnon more broadly. That effectively gave followers notice to regroup, camouflage and move to different platforms. 'If there were ever a time for a social media company to take a stand on QAnon content, it would have been like months ago, years ago,' DFRLabs' Rizzuto said. \\u2013 AP\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"It's not uncommon for software to have some bugs, even ones that go undiscovered for years. There are bugs, however, that are so severe that developers and companies scramble to plug up holes as fast as they can. That is the nightmare situation that Microsoft and Windows users have suddenly found themselves living with this aptly named PrintNightmare bug. Microsoft quickly pushed out a patch to address the issue, but the nightmare doesn't seem to be over just yet. In a nutshell, the PrintNightmare exploit targets Windows Print Spooler, the subsystem that manages printing jobs on a local network. By installing a potentially compromised printer driver, attackers will be able to run arbitrary code with administrator privileges. Unfortunately, prior to the fix, ordinary users can install such drivers.\\nSince the bug was being actively exploited, Microsoft quickly released a patch to address that matter without having to wait for its usual patch schedule. While that did fix the biggest problem, the KB5004945 update seems to have also broken some other things in the process. In particular, Windows computers that have installed the update are no longer able to connect to receipt or label printers, especially those from Zebra.\\nThe good news is that Microsoft has acknowledged that the issue exists. The bad news is that the most immediate fix is for owners of affected PCs to roll back the update. This, of course, means undoing the protection fix for PrintNightmare, but Microsoft promises that a proper fix will be coming really soon.\\nThis new complication comes after the disclosure that the PrintNightmare fix can actually still be bypassed under certain Point and Print configurations. Microsoft has updated its Security Update Information to include instructions on checking and closing those doors.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Sponsored Feature There seems to be an abundance of portable power stations these days coming in all shapes and sizes. While the different competing brands offer a wide variety of options, they all come with fixed sizes and capacities, burdening the buyer with making a hard decision upfront. Bluetti, however, has been pioneering different systems that let owners connect two power stations together. It is taking that flexibility to the next level with the AC300 and AC200 MAX Portable Power Station systems that give you the freedom to select how many Battery Packs you want or, if needed, even double the maximum power output to run a whole house off the grid. Bluetti AC300 Power Station and B300 Battery Packs\\nIt might look the part, but the Bluetti AC300 isn't exactly a complete power station. But while it might not have its own power, it does contain the parts that are critical to any portable power station. That's the 3,000W pure sine wave inverter that's needed to let DC power AC appliances. The box also supports 2,400W of solar input that should be more than enough to charge the batteries that will be attached to it.\\n\\nThe Bluetti AC300's real power will come from the 3,072Wh Bluetti B300 battery packs. Up to four of these can be connected to a single AC300 unit for a total power capacity of 12.3kWh. That's definitely more than enough for most emergency or outdoor needs, but if you need more, Bluetti gives you the flexibility to make it happen. With the company's Fusion Box Pro, you can join two AC300s, each with four B300 battery packs, for a whopping 24.6kWh of power.\\nOf course, not everyone might need that much power, which is the whole point of this new modular system. You can choose and buy only what you need at the time and expand later on if your power situation changes. Even better, you don't have to carry all of these things together, making it actually easier to move them around, especially up and down staircases.\\nBluetti AC200 MAX Portable Power Station\\n\\nBluetti hasn't forgotten those that do need an all-in-one solution, of course. The Bluetti AC200 MAX has many design similarities to the AC200P we reviewed earlier this year, but their similarities end there. The AC200 MAX is a true successor and not just because it has a slightly higher 2,048Wh battery and 2,200W sine wave inverter.\\nThe AC200 MAX does upgrade almost every aspect of the solar generator except the number of ports. As if hearing our complaint, the USB-C port now supports 100W PD3.0 output, enough for those hungry laptops. The AC200 MAX can now also be easily controlled from your smartphone, thanks to its new built-in Bluetooth connection.\\nThe most interesting aspect of the AC200 MAX, however, is its similarity to the new AC300. Despite having its own internal battery, the portable power station can connect up to two battery packs, either the same Bluetti B300 or the new 2,048Wh B230. With two B300s, the Bluetti AC200 MAX reaches an astounding 8,192Wh of power when you need it. And you don't have to break your back carrying it around as a single, massive unit.\\nBluetti Upgrades Portable Power Station Formula\\n\\nPortable power stations mostly revolve around the principles of offering clean, safe, and silent energy, whether in an emergency or when off the grid. However, most of the existing solutions lock buyers into what they selected at the time, with little room for growth or upgrades. Bluetti is now upgrading that long-held formula itself, bringing modularity and flexibility to the equation. With the Bluetti AC300, AC200 MAX, B300 Battery Packs, and B230 Battery Packs, you can buy only what you need, confident that you can increase your capacity later on when your needs increase as well.\\nThe Bluetti AC200 MAX and B230 Battery Modules will go sale in August, while the Bluetti AC300 and B300 Battery Packs are arriving later in September. Bluetti also mentioned an 'APEX' product that's coming near the end of 2021. This 'APEX' is teased to surpass even the 'Dominator' AC300's 3000W, and fans of Bluetti's power stations will probably be excited to see what's inside the mysterious black box.

Astley watched the match from a hospital bed after he volunteered to donate stem cells and bone marrow to help a blood cancer sufferer. \\u2014 Pool Photo via AP L0NDON: A young England supporter won praise on July 8 after he gave up tickets to watch the Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark to donate life-saving stem cells. Sam Astley, 24, from Sedgley in the West Midlands, was set to attend the game at Wembley on Wednesday evening after his girlfriend won tickets in a competition. But he gave up the chance and watched the match from a hospital bed after he volunteered to donate stem cells and bone marrow to help a blood cancer sufferer through UK charity Anthony Nolan and was informed he matched with a patient. He and his girlfriend gave their tickets to relatives. Astley's story was initially reported by the Stourbridge News, a local newspaper, but was then picked up more widely including on social media such as the Twitter account of former England star player Gary Lineker, now a BBC football commentator with eight million followers. 'Amazing. Can you help @FA @England ?' Lineker tweeted. Later Thursday, an official sponsor of Euro 2020, smartphone company Vivo Europe, tweeted that it wanted to help Astley attend the final. 'We saw this and would like to help Sam go to the final on Sunday,' the company tweeted. 'Sam deserves to be at the game and we want to make it happen!' A Vivo spokesman told the Stourbridge News that it had arranged for Astley and his girlfriend to attend the final as guests, to thank him for 'his selfless lifesaving donation'. The chief executive of Anthony Nolan, Henny Braund, tweeted that Astley was a 'hero'. The BBC reported that Astley underwent a procedure to remove bone marrow containing stem cells from his hip bones. Astley tweeted a picture of him in a hospital bed on Thursday, thanking Lineker and others for 'all the wonderful messages' and saying the procedure went well and he is now recovering. Anthony Nolan finds stem cell donors whose tissue is a close genetic match to blood cancer patients, so that it can be used as a transplant, giving them the best chance of survival. \\u2013 AFP\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Mark Shininger is a like a lot of millennials who played with Pok\\u00e9mon cards during grade school. He traded the collectibles with his friends and competed with his brothers for the shiniest, most powerful characters \\u2013 until eventually he tired of the hobby, stowed the cards neatly in boxes and grew up. Then last year as the pandemic wore on, Shininger began hearing about vintage Pok\\u00e9mon card sales, sometimes reaching into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. So the 24-year-old mechanical engineer from Random Lake, Wisconsin, dug up his old collection of Pikachus and Charmanders. He logged the creatures into a spreadsheet and turned his childhood passion into a US$4,500 (RM18,816) side hustle. 'I kept them because I thought one day these might be worth something,' he said. 'I was right.' A lot of twenty- and thirty-somethings are coming to a similar realisation. Fuelled by nostalgia, new ways to sell online and a surplus of free time during the pandemic, the value of certain Pok\\u00e9mon cards has skyrocketed in recent months. In 2020 overall trading card sales climbed a record 142% on EBay, and Pok\\u00e9mon led the pack, averaging five card sales a minute \\u2013 more than even baseball cards. That momentum has continued into this year. EBay listings of Pok\\u00e9mon cards were up 1,046% in the first quarter. The new Pok\\u00e9mon gold rush has fuelled a mini-explosion of entrepreneurial activity. Individual collectors like Shininger have been able to make a small killing selling cards online \\u2013 even as Target Corp suspended sales of packs after a rash of parking lot thefts. There's been an influx of business to new platforms that help collectors unload their wares. And authentication services have received too many requests to keep up. One of them, the Certified Collectibles Group, sold a majority stake to Blackstone Group Inc last week at a US$500mil (RM2.09bil) valuation. Analogue Pok\\u00e9mon cards are an unlikely sensation for the Internet era. The whimsical franchise, first introduced in 1996 as a pair of video games for Nintendo Co's Game Boy, has demonstrated remarkable staying power, bringing in tens of billions of dollars over the decades. Now managed by the Pok\\u00e9mon Co, partly owned by Nintendo, the franchise has been helped along by Pok\\u00e9mon Go, the breakout augmented reality game that's generated more than US$5bil (RM20.90bil), including US$1bil (RM4.18bil) in the past year alone, according to estimates by research firm SensorTower. The craze also fits neatly into the larger cultural trends of millennials gravitating toward brands they remember from childhood and an Internet-fuelled surge in collectibles like non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Night Ventures General Partner Ben Mathews believes the 'nerdcore collectibles' industry is having a moment. It's piqued the interest of his firm, the venture capital arm of parent company Night Media, which is seeking to invest in new ventures that tap into the Pok\\u00e9mon influencer zeitgeist. 'Give it VC funding and it's off to the races,' he said. VCs have already jumped into Pok\\u00e9mon-related deals. Earlier this week, startup Collectbase Inc raised a funding round led by billionaire Peter Thiel. The company makes software that allows collectors to scan, price, organise and track the value of their card collection, similar to a stock portfolio, and then sell on EBay. The company's mobile app Cardbase started in sports cards and expanded to Pok\\u00e9mon this spring, following months of intensifying requests, said Anas Salem, one of the site's two German founders. 'Pok\\u00e9mon cards are getting crazy in the US,' he said, adding that he thinks that a similar mania could soon take hold in Europe, where 'the market just needs more tools and education'. In the US, live auction startup Whatnot Inc has raised a total of US$75.4mil (RM315.28mil), and in May was worth more than US$500mil (RM2.09bil), according to data from research firm PitchBook. Whatnot auctions feature personalities specialising in Pok\\u00e9mon, fashion, food and other categories. The result is what one investor, Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Connie Chan, calls 'shoptainment'. It's popular in Asia, she said, and poised to grow in the US. Whatnot increased its gross sales tenfold to more than US$100mil (RM418.15mil) during the past year, thanks in large part to homebound Pok\\u00e9mon fans with extra cash. Chief executive officer Grant LaFontaine said the overwhelming majority of his site's users are millennial men with disposable incomes, many of whom used their Covid stimulus checks to buy Pok\\u00e9mon cards. Gross sales on Whatnot spiked between 50% and 100% on the day Covid stimulus checks arrived, according to LaFontaine. 'Overnight the prices doubled or tripled. Influencers move markets.' Another big boost came when YouTuber Logan Paul started purchasing vintage sealed box sets of Pok\\u00e9mon packs for upwards of US$300,000 (RM1.25mil). He then opened them live and auctioned off individual packets for as much as US$1mil (RM4.18mil) a pop, creating a ripple effect throughout the Pok\\u00e9-economy. 'Overnight the prices doubled or tripled,' LaFontaine said. 'Influencers move markets.' It also helped when Paul wore his US$1mil (RM4.18mil) mint-condition Charizard card on a diamond encrusted necklace to his boxing match with Floyd Merriweather. At trading card site Alt Platform Inc, CEO Leore Avidar said he's recently seen an 'exponential' increase in Pok\\u00e9mon card trading cards, with demand now regularly outstripping supply. Alt has raised US$30.7mil (RM128.37mil) from investors to date and was valued at US$104mil (RM434.87mil) in March, according to PitchBook data. The startup pitches itself as an investment platform for rare cards, and a few offerings on a recent day ranged from a US$275 (RM1,149) Charizard to a US$25,000 (RM104,537) holographic card of Chansey, a kindly Mexican salamander. 'Pok\\u00e9mon has become so hot that it is difficult to keep on the site,' said Avidar, who added that the past three months have been particularly brisk. 'Users here are snapping them up as soon as these cards become available.' If the Pok\\u00e9mon craze continues, new startups will surely join the fray. Night Ventures's Mathews said his firm is looking to pair YouTuber and Pok\\u00e9mon expert Leonhart with a tech executive and then bankroll their efforts. The result, Mathews said, would be an event-driven site that would be hosted on a soon-to-launch platform called Rare Candy. Leonhart, a former attorney whose real name is Lee Steinfeld, said he already makes about double his lawyer salary by streaming Pok\\u00e9mon events on YouTube, and he's eager to expand his platform to auctions. One of his more famous clips from last year features him opening a first edition pack and pulling out a holographic Charizard card valued at US$55,000 (RM229,982). The video garnered 2.2 million views. But what goes up must come down, and some fear that the surge in demand for Pok\\u00e9mon could eventually turn into a glut in supply. Right now, the number of professionally authenticated cards is artificially low. That's because the major companies evaluating Pok\\u00e9mon cards were overwhelmed with submissions from homebound customers during the pandemic. Certified Collectibles Group has been racing to keep up, and Professional Sports Authenticator suspended accepting new cards in March while it rented more space, hired hundreds of new workers and tackled the backlog. Beckett Grading suspended normal operations in June. Authentication companies determine the value of a card based on its rarity, picture clarity, placement and other factors, with the best cards earning a grade 10 and the poorest a 1. While ungraded cards can still have value, earning a rating from a certified group acts as a multiplier. Once the authenticators come back online with expanded capacity, the new supply will hit the Pok\\u00e9mon card resale market and could potentially upend it. 'Going from a population of 50 to 300 can really crater the value' for individual owners of those cards, said Whatnot's LaFontaine. For some collectors, though, it's not all about the money. Shininger put the proceeds of the cards he's already sold toward a down payment on a condo. But he's still holding onto about 100 vintage, high-value cards in a special binder and has no immediate plans to sell them. 'It's a lot of sentimental nostalgia,' he said. 'It reminds me of my childhood.' \\u2013 Bloomberg\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"A security man uses the EDE scanner, a new screening system that allegedly detects whether or not people have the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by using a mobile at a mall in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. \\u2014 Reuters BEIRUT: Data rights groups are warning of privacy violations and risks to vulnerable communities after Abu Dhabi deployed scanners at border crossings, malls and other public locations that could detect Covid-19 in seconds. The Abu Dhabi health department says the EDE scanners can confirm a Covid-19 infection by measuring an individual's electromagnetic wave emissions, which it says are altered when the coronavirus is present, according to a June 27 statement by Abu Dhabi's Media Office. The new system has rights groups and even some residents worried. 'I went to a mall, and instead of a temperature scan, the (security guard) appeared to be taking a picture on a cellphone,' said Firas, a consultant who has been living in Abu Dhabi for nine months and asked to use a pseudonym. He said the guard informed him that the phone camera was not only testing his electromagnetic emissions but also conducting a retina scan, which the guard said could tell him whether Firas was vaccinated or had had a recent PCR test. Firas suspected the scanner was linked to the digital identification system used by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to provide residents access to their health records, visa applications and other official processes. 'That's the compromise you make when you come here. We signed a deal with this system in exchange for safety and security,' he said. A Media Office spokesperson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that 'the scanners are not linked to any identification system and no one is identified when scanned', adding that the system neither captures nor stores any personal data. Authorities in the UAE have relied heavily on artificial intelligence for years, including facial recognition technology. In 2018, Dubai police launched a network of thousands of cameras \\u2013 dubbed Oyoon, Arabic for 'eyes' \\u2013 to help them fight crime across the emirate. After the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, UAE police deployed smart helmets to scan the temperatures of up to 200 passersby a minute, while police in Dubai pledged to publish photos of anyone violating curfew restrictions without blurring their faces. Matt Mahmoudi, a technology researcher at Amnesty International, called it 'the surveillance-for-services tradeoff' often seen in smart cities. 'That particular type of facial recognition (the kind rolled out in Abu Dhabi) is worrying because the technology of mass surveillance stands to be in violation of people's right to privacy,' he said over the phone. The UAE is rated 'not free' by the US-based think tank Freedom House, which said state surveillance of the Internet was widespread, infringed on users' right to privacy, and did not appear to be regulated by any 'meaningful legal oversight'. That 'opaque legal framework' could specifically lead to the harassment of religious or sexual minorities in the largely conservative emirates, said Mohamad Najem, executive director of Lebanon-based digital rights group Smex. Khalid Ibrahim, executive director of the nonprofit Gulf Centre for Human Rights, also worried the technology could lead to more surveillance of migrant workers in the UAE, which the International Labour Organisation says hosts the fifth-largest migrant population in the world. The rollout of Abu Dhabi's new scanners 'was not transparent', Ibrahim said, demanding more details from the government on how the technology works, what role facial recognition plays in it, and if security forces would have access to the results. 'These are all important questions that the government's shrinking amount of transparency have not addressed,' he said. \\u2013 Thomson Reuters Foundation\",\n",

(Polestar) Polestar, the independent Swedish electric performance car brand founded by Volvo and Geely, only sells two models: the Polestar 1 hybrid and the Polestar 2 electric vehicle (EV). But there is variety to be found in that small lineup, as the brand's appearance at the Goodwood Festival of Speed shows.This year, Polestar brought an experimental version of the Polestar 2 to highlight what is possible when the company's engineers flex a bit. The new EV is painted in Snow Matte and looks mostly like a standard Polestar 2. Look closer, though, and you will see a lot of tweaks here and there. Both the front and rear bumpers are slightly different, and there's a conspicuous Magnesium Matte racing stripe running down the middle. The gloss black side mirrors stand out from the black-and-white grille and two-tone 21-inch wheels.The experimental vehicle is 30 millimeters lower than a stock Polestar 2, and its track is 20 mm wider. Additionally, the wheel arches are wider to fit the Akebono front brakes and the 275/30R21 Pirelli PZero Rosso performance tires from the Polestar 1. The suspension springs are stiffer (up 80 percent in front, 40 percent more in back), and Polestar added a carbon fiber front suspension strut bar from a Volvo S60 Polestar Engineered to make the EV even more rigid. The Experimental Polestar 2 gets performance boosts as well, with the power output increased to 476 horsepower from the standard long-range, dual-motor Polestar 2's 408 hp.The annual Goodwood festival is an important space for Polestar. The brand debuted a prototype version of the Polestar 1 to the public there back in 2018. Polestar's then-chief test driver, Joakim Rydholm, now the company's chief chassis engineer, drove that car. Rydholm will take the experimental Polestar 2 on hill-climb runs during this year's event.The EV that will be on hand at Goodwood this year is not the only special Polestar 2 in existence. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said that he's been driving a different experimental version, nicknamed 'Beast,' on the company's Gothenburg campus. The Beast inspired the Goodwood version, but Polestar revealed no performance details for that EV.Polestar will soon add more models to its small lineup; the limited-edition Polestar 1 will soon end production.

      "      \"summary\": \"While the world was slowly moving towards a new era of digitization, the pandemic provided a much-needed push. As a result, computer technologies are gaining significant traction and things that once seemed surreal have become very much possible. The long list includes things such as e-commerce, electronic payments, and virtual currencies or better yet known as cryptocurrencies. And with an entirely digital future now seeming in reach, Blockchain technology is at the root of this inescapable tomorrow.\\u00a0\\n'Blockchain' was a term unheard of when its origins were first laid down by its mysterious creator, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto for the introduction of Bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency.\\u00a0\\n\\nBlockchain And Cryptocurrencies\\nBlockchain technology is at the core of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and its underlying technology were the first to beget an entire ecosystem of more than 4000 cryptocurrencies.\\u00a0 Bitcoin, along with many other crypto coins, has become a hot topic of discussion over the previous months.\\u00a0\\nWhat was initially developed as a protocol for peer-to-peer electronic cash transactions has caused quite the stir in the trading world. Crypto arbitrage is perhaps one of the most popular ways of capitalizing on this highly volatile market. Also, many risk-averse crypto investors usually invest in different crypto coins. To their delight, a crypto portfolio manager can be easily arranged for guidance on such investments.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nPrinciples Of Blockchain Technology\\nBlockchain, as evident by its name, is formed by a network of computers coming together to form a \\u2018block'. A block may contain different types of data relating to transactions, records, trades, or even contracts. The block is added to a ledger, forming a chain. This means to create a new block, information from old blocks must be read sequentially.\\nThere is no central authority that operates this technology which gives it a decentralized nature. At the same time, it allows the system to enjoy the unique characteristic of being\\u00a0 \\u2018trustless'.\\nHowever, the technology has evolved significantly since its early days in 2008. In fact, it now has the potential to grow to be a bedrock of the global record-keeping system. Bitcoin's technology is being realized today by innovators across the board. Several sectors are exploring ways of integrating blockchain into their infrastructures, all the way from medicine to finance. There are also a number of platforms to aid the integration of blockchain into your structure.\\nIBM, for example, has made huge strides towards bringing blockchain into the mainstream. The IBM blockchain platform allows businesses to digitize transactions safely. It also allows its participants to avail all the benefits that the technology has to offer of which there are many. Some of the most common are mentioned below:\\u00a0\\nImproved Transparency\\u00a0\\nNo matter what sector a business operates in, transparency in the way it performs its operations is becoming increasingly important to users. Increasing rules and regulations have been attempted to improve transparency. However, one aspect of any system, namely centralization, prevents it from being entirely transparent.\\nBlockchain rises as a new hope. Its most distinctive characteristic and perhaps greatest strength is the public ledger of transactions for public addresses is accessible to everyone. This is unaffected by any central party such as banks or government allowing it to be completely decentralized. As a result, this adds a layer of accountability to financial systems and businesses. This is because each sector of the company is held accountable for acting with integrity toward the company's growth and its customers.\\nEnhanced Security\\nIn contrast to other record-keeping methods, blockchain is considered far more superior in terms of security. This is because it maintains records by encrypting and linking new transactions to the previous ones.\\u00a0\\nFurthermore, each node on the blockchain network has a record of all transactions performed on the network. Therefore any malicious entity trying to tamper with any specific transaction will be unable to do so since other nodes will refuse to accept it.\\nImmutability is another key characteristic of blockchain networks, meaning that data, once written, can not be reversed in any manner. Hence, it may prove to be the ideal choice for sectors that require systems that thrive on immutable data.\\u00a0\\nGreater Efficiency\\nBlockchain is an entirely decentralized technology. This means there is no need for any intermediaries in processes for different fields. Areas such as finance and real estate can really benefit from this. This is because blockchain technology facilitates much quicker transactions and very low transaction fees.\\u00a0\\nAlso, the ledger's capacity to store transactions in one place makes it possible for everything to be executed. As a result, the streamlining and automation of processes such as property management allows for more efficient operations.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Richard Branson's rocket-powered trip to the edge of space on Sunday will mark a return to the daredevil exploits that first established the billionaire's swashbuckling reputation.\\nFor decades, Branson engaged in a series of record-breaking stunts in which he kite-surfed for 30 miles (48 kilometers) between England and France, crossed the Atlantic Ocean by speedboat in just three days and then spanned the Pacific in a hot-air balloon at speeds of as much as 245 miles per hour. \\n \\n\\n While the high-octane escapades propelled Branson to near rock-star status and attracted huge publicity for his Virgin Group companies, they also saw the Briton rescued by emergency services on multiple occasions. That prompted him to dial down the risk taking to comparatively sedate activities such as bungee jumping, yacht racing and a 2 000-kilometer triathlon.\\nBut the race to establish the world's first space-tourism venture has revived the aging entrepreneur's buccaneering spirit. After the announcement last month that Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos would ride on rocket made by his Blue Origin company on July 20, Branson declared that he'd be aboard a Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. test flight nine days earlier \\u2014 a week before he turns 71.\\nWill Whitehorn, a former president of Virgin Galactic who helped establish the company, said the move is typical of Branson, whose mantra of 'Screw It, Let's Do It' and a propensity to approve even the most challenging projects led staff to nickname him 'Dr. Yes.'\\n'Richard is not a fearful person, but he's also a thoughtful person,' Whitehorn, now president of the UKspace trade association, said in an interview. 'He would not be going if he did not believe that this was safe. And if he manages to beat Jeff Bezos, good luck to him.'\\nThe decision to fly followed approval from the US Federal Aviation Administration for Virgin Galactic to carry fee-paying passengers.\\n'You can't expect scientists and space tourists to go if the boss is not prepared to,' Whitehorn said.\\nDeadly crash\\nBranson will journey in Virgin's VSS Unity spaceplane, itself carried aloft by a so-called mothership aircraft, in a trip that's expected to take about 90 minutes from takeoff to landing. After being released from the carrier plane, the Unity will ignite a rocket engine to propel it to a height of 55 miles above Earth.\\nThat's beyond the boundary recognized by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration as the edge of space, although short of the Karman Line, an internationally recognized space frontier at 62 miles from the planet.\\nThe same Virgin Galactic spacecraft model suffered a crash that killed a test pilot in 2014, when a descent mechanism was triggered with the rocket still climbing. The company did an extensive design modification to prevent that from happening again.\\nChief Executive Officer Michael Colglazier said earlier this month that the company is ready for Branson's trip after a successful test flight in May.\\nBranson, who was knighted in 1999 by Queen Elizabeth II for 'services to entrepreneurship,' has a net worth of about $7.5 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. More than 40 Virgin-brand businesses collect annual revenue of about $22 billion through partnerships, affiliations and direct holdings, a spokeswoman said in December. As with Virgin Galactic, he has typically left day-to-day management to hired executives.\\nHis business career \\u2014 spanning everything from a punk record label to gyms, bridal wear, bank accounts, a mobile phone provider and the airline for which he's been best known \\u2014 has been as varied as his extra-curricular activities.\\nAfter running a student magazine at the age of 16, his first serious foray into commerce was through a mail-order music distributor and shop that got him a costly conviction for tax evasion. Undeterred, he went on to found Virgin Records in 1972, with the name chosen to reflect his inexperience in business.\\nEmpire building\\nThe label was an immediate success as Tubular Bells, the debut album from instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, became a best seller. The company went on to sign artists including the Rolling Stones and the Sex Pistols, the latter helping to enhance Branson's image as an outsider, earning enough money to bankroll the foundation of Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. in 1984.\\nAmid a pattern of selling off all or parts of his various businesses, Branson had an unqualified success with Virgin Mobile, offloaded to NTL:Telewest for almost 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) in 2006, and the subsequent sale of the combined Virgin Media to Liberty Global for $23 billion in 2013.\\nFailures have included a doomed attempt by Virgin Cola to oust Coca-Cola and Pepsi as the leading U.S. soft drinks, and the condom line Mates, sold off just a year after its launch.\\nPlans for an air-launched spaceship were first mooted at Virgin as long ago as 1995, according to Whitehorn, who says he, Branson and Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin drafted out the concept on a napkin. Aldrin was enthusiastic about the idea following the success of X-15 rocket planes launched from a B-52 bomber in the 1960s, Whitehorn said.\\nThe Virgin Galactic name was registered in 1999, and the company was officially founded five years later. The business model promised the first space tourists a short period of weightlessness along with views of the curvature of the Earth and a look at the sun and stars against the backdrop of space, all for a neat $250 000.\\nThe 2014 crash set the project back by four years but by 2019 Virgin Galactic was sufficiently on track to become the world's first publicly traded space-tourism firm, thanks to a deal with a special purpose acquisition company. Virgin Galactic had a market value of more than $12 billion at the close on Thursday in New York.\\nThe listing in turn helped Branson save Virgin Atlantic when the coronavirus pandemic hit. The UK government declined to provide the grounded carrier with state aid, partly as a result of his residence on Necker Island, a tax haven he bought in 1978 in the appropriately named British Virgin Islands. The sale of part of his Virgin Galactic stake allowed him to inject 200 million pounds into the carrier, part of a broader rescue plan. \\u00a9 2021 Bloomberg\",\n",

(Polestar) Polestar, the independent Swedish electric performance car brand founded by Volvo and Geely, only sells two models: the Polestar 1 hybrid and the Polestar 2 electric vehicle (EV). But there is variety to be found in that small lineup, as the brand's appearance at the Goodwood Festival of Speed shows.This year, Polestar brought an experimental version of the Polestar 2 to highlight what is possible when the company's engineers flex a bit. The new EV is painted in Snow Matte and looks mostly like a standard Polestar 2. Look closer, though, and you will see a lot of tweaks here and there. Both the front and rear bumpers are slightly different, and there's a conspicuous Magnesium Matte racing stripe running down the middle. The gloss black side mirrors stand out from the black-and-white grille and two-tone 21-inch wheels.The experimental vehicle is 30 millimeters lower than a stock Polestar 2, and its track is 20 mm wider. Additionally, the wheel arches are wider to fit the Akebono front brakes and the 275/30R21 Pirelli PZero Rosso performance tires from the Polestar 1. The suspension springs are stiffer (up 80 percent in front, 40 percent more in back), and Polestar added a carbon fiber front suspension strut bar from a Volvo S60 Polestar Engineered to make the EV even more rigid. The Experimental Polestar 2 gets performance boosts as well, with the power output increased to 476 horsepower from the standard long-range, dual-motor Polestar 2's 408 hp.The annual Goodwood festival is an important space for Polestar. The brand debuted a prototype version of the Polestar 1 to the public there back in 2018. Polestar's then-chief test driver, Joakim Rydholm, now the company's chief chassis engineer, drove that car. Rydholm will take the experimental Polestar 2 on hill-climb runs during this year's event.The EV that will be on hand at Goodwood this year is not the only special Polestar 2 in existence. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said that he's been driving a different experimental version, nicknamed 'Beast,' on the company's Gothenburg campus. The Beast inspired the Goodwood version, but Polestar revealed no performance details for that EV.Polestar will soon add more models to its small lineup; the limited-edition Polestar 1 will soon end production. The brand unveiled a concept vehicle called the Precept that will inform a future production model, and a Polestar 3 electric SUV is also in the works.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Swedish premium electric performance car brand\\u00a0Polestar unveiled an experimental Polestar 2 EV at this year's Goodwood Festival of Speed in the UK. (Polestar) Polestar, the independent Swedish electric performance car brand founded by Volvo and Geely, only sells two models: the Polestar 1 hybrid and the Polestar 2 electric vehicle (EV). But there is variety to be found in that small lineup, as the brand's appearance at the Goodwood Festival of Speed shows.This year, Polestar brought an experimental version of the Polestar 2 to highlight what is possible when the company's engineers flex a bit. The new EV is painted in Snow Matte and looks mostly like a standard Polestar 2. Look closer, though, and you will see a lot of tweaks here and there. Both the front and rear bumpers are slightly different, and there's a conspicuous Magnesium Matte racing stripe running down the middle. The gloss black side mirrors stand out from the black-and-white grille and two-tone 21-inch wheels.The experimental vehicle is 30 millimeters lower than a stock Polestar 2, and its track is 20 mm wider. Additionally, the wheel arches are wider to fit the Akebono front brakes and the 275/30R21 Pirelli PZero Rosso performance tires from the Polestar 1. The suspension springs are stiffer (up 80 percent in front, 40 percent more in back), and Polestar added a carbon fiber front suspension strut bar from a Volvo S60 Polestar Engineered to make the EV even more rigid. The Experimental Polestar 2 gets performance boosts as well, with the power output increased to 476 horsepower from the standard long-range, dual-motor Polestar 2's 408 hp.The annual Goodwood festival is an important space for Polestar. The brand debuted a prototype version of the Polestar 1 to the public there back in 2018. Polestar's then-chief test driver, Joakim Rydholm, now the company's chief chassis engineer, drove that car. Rydholm will take the experimental Polestar 2 on hill-climb runs during this year's event.The EV that will be on hand at Goodwood this year is not the only special Polestar 2 in existence. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said that he's been driving a different experimental version, nicknamed 'Beast,' on the company's Gothenburg campus. The Beast inspired the Goodwood version, but Polestar revealed no performance details for that EV.Polestar will soon add more models to its small lineup; the limited-edition Polestar 1 will soon end production. The brand unveiled a concept vehicle called the Precept that will inform a future production model, and a Polestar 3 electric SUV is also in the works.\",\n",

Now, the e-commerce giant has expanded support for the feature, allowing you to host or join a Watch Party on Fire TV devices. While Amazon didn't make a big announcement for the feature's arrival on the platform, it updated the list of compatible devices on Watch Party's FAQ, as noticed by XDA Developers. The section now says that you can co-watch with friends and fellow Prime members on a Fire TV device within the Prime Video app.\\nYou still can't co-watch movies and shows with friends on mobile, but you can access the chat section of a Watch Party when you update to the latest version of the Prime Video app for phones and tablets. That'll give you an easy way to talk to other participants without access to a computer, as well as an easy way to create and share Watch Party invites.\\nAmazon originally launched the feature on Twitch back in 2019, allowing streamers to watch videos with their viewers. The version available from within Prime Video itself is more suitable if you're not a streamer and just want to watch with people you're close to. All participants in a party must also have Prime subscriptions, though, and they must rent or purchase the movie or show the host is watching.All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Viloshena, 37, said that during the early implementation of the movement control order (MCO) last year, the school used the PdPR method in a modular manner with the subject teachers giving the soft copy modules to class teachers.\\n\\nShe said the class teachers would then send the modules to the school's Senior Administrative Assistant who would then print and place the modules at the school guard house to be picked up by the students' parents.\\n\\nHowever, she said, some parents did not take the module, prompting the teachers to try another approach this year by going to the students' houses to send the modules.\\n\\n\\\"Apart from that, I also record my lessons in Powerpoint and then uploaded it onto YouTube and sent the link to the students so that they can watch it at any time.\\n\\n\\\"I also use Kahoot !, Quizziz and liveworksheet.com to provide interactive exercises for my students, as well as the Project-Based Learning approach,' she said when met by Bernama.\\n\\nAnother teacher, Noor Azlinda Shuhaimi, 37, of Sekolah Kebangsaan Rtb Bukit Changgang in Banting, Selangor, said she started 'video lessons' since the early implementation of MCO in March last year as online applications such as Google Meet were less effective as due to poor Internet access and some students not having the necessary devices.\\n\\n\\\"I started with basic grammar for all ages and then make the teaching materials according to the textbook syllabus.

I also insert the use of password for each lesson so that I can track students who do not follow the lessons,\\\" she added.\\n\\nNoor Azlinda, who is known as 'Teacher Linda' on YouTube and had been invited to be a panel at a websinar to share her 'video lessons' by the Selangor State Education Department, said the response from the students was good with them asking for more.\\n\\n\\\"My advice to teachers is that we have to continue to explore various ways so that students can catch up and grasp what we want to convey. We can also do a live lesson like through Google Meet, but it has to depend on the background of our students because not everyone can join.\\n\\n\\\"As teachers, we know better what way is appropriate for our students,' she added. \\u2013 Bernama\",\n",

Steve Ballmer, the former chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp, has a net worth of more than US$100bil (RM418.15bil), making him the ninth person in the world to reach that lofty plateau. Oracle Corp founder Larry Ellison fell just short of making it an even 10, ending Wednesday with a fortune of US$98.6bil (RM412.29bil), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ballmer, 65, who stepped down as Microsoft's CEO in 2014 and now owns the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, has seen his wealth grow by US$20.1bil (RM84.04bil) this year, while Ellison has added US$18.9bil (RM79.03bil). A rally in tech shares has fuelled the latest surge in wealth, with seven of those above the US$100bil (RM418.15bil) mark deriving their fortunes from technology companies. Amazon.com Inc's Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, has been among the biggest recipients of that rally and now has a record net worth of US$212.1bil (RM886.89bil). Together, the nine members of the club \\u2013 along with Ellison \\u2013 have added about US$245bil (RM1.02 trillion) to their fortunes since the start of the year and are now collectively worth US$1.36 trillion (RM5.68 trillion). In addition to being mostly technology chiefs, the group is also largely American, with French luxury goods mogul Bernard Arnault the only exception. While the stock rally has boosted the fortunes of the world's richest, it's also renewed scrutiny of wealth inequality and taxes. Using leaked confidential tax return data, news outlet ProPublica reported last month that Bezos, Elon Musk and other top billionaires had paid little to no income tax in some years, leading to calls from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and others to reexamine the tax code. US President Joe Biden is pushing a broad of package of tax changes that aim to force the wealthy to hand over more of their money. He wants to double the capital gains tax to a top rate of 39.6% and toughen rules governing trusts, estates and other vehicles often used by millionaires and billionaires to reduce their tax bills. 'The persistent lack of wealth for large shares of Americans is striking,' said Kenan Fikri, director of research at Economic Innovation Group, a Washington-based think tank started by tech entrepreneurs including Napster Inc co-founder Sean Parker. 'Markets are reaching historic highs but far too few people see any direct economic benefit from it.' Ballmer's taxes were cited in a ProPublica story Thursday that showed how billionaires use ownership of sports teams to lower their tax obligation. The Clippers owner made US$656mil (RM2.74bil) in 2018 and paid US$78mil (RM326.15mil) in taxes, a federal income tax rate of 12%, much lower than the team's star players or arena workers. Propublica, which cited Internal Revenue Service documents, said a spokesperson for Ballmer declined to answer specific questions. The spokesperson told the news outlet that the billionaire has always 'paid the taxes he owes, and has publicly noted that he would personally be fine with paying more'. \\u2013 Bloomberg\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Swedish premium electric performance car brand\\u00a0Polestar unveiled an experimental Polestar 2 EV at this year's Goodwood Festival of Speed in the UK. (Polestar) Polestar, the independent Swedish electric performance car brand founded by Volvo and Geely, only sells two models: the Polestar 1 hybrid and the Polestar 2 electric vehicle (EV). But there is variety to be found in that small lineup, as the brand's appearance at the Goodwood Festival of Speed shows.This year, Polestar brought an experimental version of the Polestar 2 to highlight what is possible when the company's engineers flex a bit. The new EV is painted in Snow Matte and looks mostly like a standard Polestar 2. Look closer, though, and you will see a lot of tweaks here and there. Both the front and rear bumpers are slightly different, and there's a conspicuous Magnesium Matte racing stripe running down the middle. The gloss black side mirrors stand out from the black-and-white grille and two-tone 21-inch wheels.The experimental vehicle is 30 millimeters lower than a stock Polestar 2, and its track is 20 mm wider. Additionally, the wheel arches are wider to fit the Akebono front brakes and the 275/30R21 Pirelli PZero Rosso performance tires from the Polestar 1. The suspension springs are stiffer (up 80 percent in front, 40 percent more in back), and Polestar added a carbon fiber front suspension strut bar from a Volvo S60 Polestar Engineered to make the EV even more rigid. The Experimental Polestar 2 gets performance boosts as well, with the power output increased to 476 horsepower from the standard long-range, dual-motor Polestar 2's 408 hp.The annual Goodwood festival is an important space for Polestar. The brand debuted a prototype version of the Polestar 1 to the public there back in 2018. Polestar's then-chief test driver, Joakim Rydholm, now the company's chief chassis engineer, drove that car. Rydholm will take the experimental Polestar 2 on hill-climb runs during this year's event.The EV that will be on hand at Goodwood this year is not the only special Polestar 2 in existence. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said that he's been driving a different experimental version, nicknamed 'Beast,' on the company's Gothenburg campus. The Beast inspired the Goodwood version, but Polestar revealed no performance details for that EV.Polestar will soon add more models to its small lineup; the limited-edition Polestar 1 will soon end production. The brand unveiled a concept vehicle called the Precept that will inform a future production model, and a Polestar 3 electric SUV is also in the works.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Swedish premium electric performance car brand\\u00a0Polestar unveiled an experimental Polestar 2 EV at this year's Goodwood Festival of Speed in the UK. (Polestar) Polestar, the independent Swedish electric performance car brand founded by Volvo and Geely, only sells two models: the Polestar 1 hybrid and the Polestar 2 electric vehicle (EV). But there is variety to be found in that small lineup, as the brand's appearance at the Goodwood Festival of Speed shows.This year, Polestar brought an experimental version of the Polestar 2 to highlight what is possible when the company's engineers flex a bit. The new EV is painted in Snow Matte and looks mostly like a standard Polestar 2. Look closer, though, and you will see a lot of tweaks here and there. Both the front and rear bumpers are slightly different, and there's a conspicuous Magnesium Matte racing stripe running down the middle. The gloss black side mirrors stand out from the black-and-white grille and two-tone 21-inch wheels.The experimental vehicle is 30 millimeters lower than a stock Polestar 2, and its track is 20 mm wider. Additionally, the wheel arches are wider to fit the Akebono front brakes and the 275/30R21 Pirelli PZero Rosso performance tires from the Polestar 1. The suspension springs are stiffer (up 80 percent in front, 40 percent more in back), and Polestar added a carbon fiber front suspension strut bar from a Volvo S60 Polestar Engineered to make the EV even more rigid. The Experimental Polestar 2 gets performance boosts as well, with the power output increased to 476 horsepower from the standard long-range, dual-motor Polestar 2's 408 hp.The annual Goodwood festival is an important space for Polestar. The brand debuted a prototype version of the Polestar 1 to the public there back in 2018. Polestar's then-chief test driver, Joakim Rydholm, now the company's chief chassis engineer, drove that car. Rydholm will take the experimental Polestar 2 on hill-climb runs during this year's event.The EV that will be on hand at Goodwood this year is not the only special Polestar 2 in existence. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said that he's been driving a different experimental version, nicknamed 'Beast,' on the company's Gothenburg campus. The Beast inspired the Goodwood version, but Polestar revealed no performance details for that EV.Polestar will soon add more models to its small lineup; the limited-edition Polestar 1 will soon end production. The brand unveiled a concept vehicle called the Precept that will inform a future production model, and a Polestar 3 electric SUV is also in the works.\",\n",

It further says that the new RSVP option will initially be available on Google Calendar and that it will be coming to calendar invitations in Gmail soon. It will also be available to all Google Workspace customers, as well as G Suite Basic and Business customers across the globe.Last month Google Meet, the video platform for the web, tweaked its UI for a better call quality experience. It will now show suggestions in the form of gentle notifications that will appear as a bubble and red dot over the More Options button next to End Call in the revamped bottom bar. Google Meet also rolled out Smart Canvas or the ability to present from Docs, Sheets, and Slides directly to Google Meet. This will save on the user's time who is giving a presentation as they will directly be able to present their content to a Google Meet call on the web directly from the Doc, Sheet, or Slide.Google Meet users will see a Present to a meeting button to the left of Share at the top of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. It will list meetings that are scheduled in the Calendar. Users will also get the option to manually enter a code, while it defaults to any ongoing ones. In such cases, users will get a Present tab to meeting option using the standard options and the ability to choose different tabs, windows, or the entire screen.Click here for IndiaToday.in's complete coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"(Image credit: Tada Images / Shutterstock)\\n\\n\\nWhatsApp is testing a new feature that could make it much easier to share high-quality photos and video in the messaging app.Right now, any snaps you share with friends or family over the messaging app are crunched down using lossy compression, which significantly reduces their quality.But as spotted by WABetaInfo, a new option being tested in the WhatsApp beta for Android (version 2.21.14.16) would give you the choice of sending photos or video in either 'Data saver' (compressed) or in a new 'Best quality' format.It's not yet clear whether 'Best quality' means completely uncompressed or, perhaps more likely, a lighter form of compression that preserves image quality. All the beta says right now is that \\\"best quality photos are larger and can take longer to send\\\".Google Photos already offers a similar dual option for its photos, but its alternative to compressed photos is 'Original quality', which preserves the same resolution and quality as the original file.Either way, it's likely to be a very handy option for anyone who regularly uses WhatsApp to share photos, but would prefer them to be kept intact rather than put through the messaging app's compression ringer.\\u00a0The same beta version of the app also contains an identical option for videos, too. Both options will likely be found in the 'storage and data' section of WhatsApp's settings on the Android app, though it's not yet clear if the same feature is being tested for iOS users.\\u00a0(Image credit: WABetaInfo)Crunch timeIt's technically possible to send uncompressed photos using WhatsApp right now, but it requires an awkward workaround that involves converting the image into a PDF before sending it.Although it's not yet clear when WhatsApp's new 'Best quality' feature might be rolled out officially, it promises to be a much slicker, and long overdue, way to send photos that preserve the quality that's possible on the best phone cameras.While it's understandable that WhatApp's default mode is to compress images for speed and mobile data purposes, the messaging app's ubiquity makes it a great way to quickly share snaps with almost anyone. That goes for pro photographers too, who might use the app to send preview snaps to clients more if it didn't crunch all files down to around 2MP.The promise of an 'Auto' mode in the beta screenshot above also suggests that you might be able to leave WhatsApp to decide the level of compression, based on whether you're using mobile data or Wi-Fi. But we'll have to wait to see the full release, hopefully soon, before seeing exactly how that option will work.\\u00a0Check out our guide to the world's best photo editors\",\n",

(Not in the UK? Scroll down for TV deals in your region below.)The launch price of the 705 was previously \\u00a3979 at a 55-inch size, which was already a startlingly low amount for a brand-new OLED TV. Despite the low price and \\u00a380 discount, too, you're getting Philips' high-spec P5 chip with AI processing, and excellent HDR support across the board.The discount is ostensibly to celebrate the upcoming Euros final, with the 'Come-on England \\u00a3899' offer only lasting for a few days \\u2013 until Tuesday 13 July. If you take advantage of the OLED TV deal fast, of course, you could have it delivered and set up in time for the final on this coming Sunday \\u2013 though even those who aren't following the football will benefit from OLED's particular picture charms (deep blacks, bright highlights, and the like).Philips 55OLED705: \\u00a3979 \\u00a3899 at AO.com\\nThis budget OLED has been given a neat \\u00a380 discount shortly after launching, and comes with both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support. With 50W 2.1 channel speakers, it should pack a good punch in the audio department too.With Dolby Vision and HDR10+ dynamic HDR standards, you're getting all the format support you need for a knockout movie night \\u2013 especially with Philips' proprietary Ambilight technology, which throws onscreen colors into the wall behind your television for an immersive, ambient glow.You are only getting three-sided Ambilight, though, compared to the four-sided Ambilight found on the rest of Philips' OLED and Mini LED TVs this year.Unlike some entry-point OLEDs, the 705 will pack in a capable audio output of 50W across 2.1 channels, with compatibility for both Dolby Atmos and DTS Play-Fi too. It runs on the Android TV smart platform. That's far more audio heft than you'll find on the entry-level LG A1 OLED, which comes with just 20W output.What are the best OLED TVs?\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"GUEST OPINION by Andy Mellor Regional Vice President ANZ at Kofax: If you've ever gritted your teeth while listening to bad hold music, or cursed as you completed forms by hand, you don't need to be told that sometimes, government process can be inefficient, complex and slow. With the $200m MyGov overhaul announced in this year's budget and the shift to online services in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it's a timely reminder that federal, state and local governments, along with the various agencies, need to make sure their digital services are easy to use. After all, government agencies need to remember: the Australian people are your customers. As such, they expect a modern customer experience \\u2013 one that's frictionless and efficient. They want to submit forms online, get answers in real-time via chat and have information auto-populated based on past submissions. Yet, there are also instances when they still want to pick up the phone and talk to a human. Meeting this demand for flexibility and convenience, quality and speed, while keeping an eye on the bottom line, can be achieved through digital and automated business processes. Many have started this transformation with robotic process automation (RPA), which uses software 'bots' to automate repetitive, manual tasks. While this is an excellent starting point, it's just the beginning. A recent study found 98 percent of decision-makers reported challenges due to an unintegrated 'point solution' approach to integration. Simply put, even a few legacy paper-based and manual processes can create bottlenecks, backlogs, and errors in existing systems. People get frustrated (and start rage tweeting), while staff feel tired and disappointed from mundane work and customer ire. As we saw during the pandemic, the situation gets even worse during times of peak demand as agency websites crash in the rush to receive services, overtaxing the system. To truly modernise complex delivery service operations, government agencies need a unified platform that provides end-to-end automation through various workflow automation capabilities. Implementation should be simple, and the system must be scalable and easily maintained by existing operations and IT resources. \\u2018Hyperautomation' with a unified platform Ninety-nine percent of decision-makers see considerable value in working with a single automation vendor. A unified platform that natively combines complementary capabilities such as paper document capture, mobile-enabled digital processing, unstructured data extraction and classification, and automated workflows enabling government agencies to reach a state of 'hyperautomation' across functional and process silos. However, government services can be complex, involving data validation and requiring action from multiple offices, departments and even other agencies. Oftentimes, users or a third party have to supply additional information. The ensuing back-and-forth is slow, costly, and frustrating when done with traditional mail, email and _ can you believe it? _fax. An innovative intelligent automation platform includes the right mix of tools and technology to transform service delivery. Address updates, loan processing and other actions that used to take four to six weeks to complete can be shaved down to a simple, five-minute mobile transaction. An end-to-end approach to automation benefits agencies and constituents in many ways, including: Faster application approval times Reduced processing costs and program churn Improved data quality Fewer errors Flexibility in how people interact Faster access to services Optimised back-end paperwork processes Real-time support for constituents The components for success Every agency's needs are unique, so there isn't one perfect approach for all. But native integration on a single platform of all the technologies government agencies might need to modernise services offers numerous advantages. It meets a wide array of use cases and works for all levels of government and agencies. Most automation companies offer specific products for certain processes. However, the real world requires holistic solutions not one product. Failure to partner with a company that provides a unified platform leads to several vendors, licensing and contract negotiations as well as arduous manual integrations and maintenance. Key automation technologies to look for in a unified platform include: Robotic process automation (RPA): Automate labour-intensive, repetitive tasks across systems and data sources at scale. Process orchestration: Coordinate workflows involving multiple people, actions, software robots, policies and systems to drive successful outcomes. AI-enabled cognitive capture: Ingest and understand structured and unstructured content, regardless of format or channel, through the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). Advanced Analytics: Leverage the data captured to gain visibility and actionable insight into agencies, robots and constituents. Mobility and engagement: Provide efficient, effective and secure means for interactions and transactions through such capabilities as e-signature, facial recognition and on-demand communications. When these complementary technologies work together as part of a unified platform, government agencies can create automated workflows, perform dynamic case management, and automate tasks across any system or application \\u2013 including commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS), and military off-the-shelf (MOTS) products. No longer siloed, the information becomes actionable. Employees have more time to meaningfully assist the public rather than processing papers \\u2013 leading to higher employee satisfaction. And let's not forget about the benefits for us. With the freedom to select their preferred channel of communication, ease-of-use and speed-of-services, the average person's experience is as seamless as it is on Amazon. Now's the time for government agencies to implement an end-to-end unified automation solution. They'll save time and money while matching the levels of speed and service the public have come to expect on consumer services. A unified platform equipped with a comprehensive set of intelligent automation technologies catapults agencies into the modern world and delivers the benefits that come along with it. It also finally means an end to those 'listening to instrumental Billy Joel covers on hold' moments.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Swedish premium electric performance car brand\\u00a0Polestar unveiled an experimental Polestar 2 EV at this year's Goodwood Festival of Speed in the UK. (Polestar) Polestar, the independent Swedish electric performance car brand founded by Volvo and Geely, only sells two models: the Polestar 1 hybrid and the Polestar 2 electric vehicle (EV). But there is variety to be found in that small lineup, as the brand's appearance at the Goodwood Festival of Speed shows.This year, Polestar brought an experimental version of the Polestar 2 to highlight what is possible when the company's engineers flex a bit. The new EV is painted in Snow Matte and looks mostly like a standard Polestar 2. Look closer, though, and you will see a lot of tweaks here and there. Both the front and rear bumpers are slightly different, and there's a conspicuous Magnesium Matte racing stripe running down the middle. The gloss black side mirrors stand out from the black-and-white grille and two-tone 21-inch wheels.The experimental vehicle is 30 millimeters lower than a stock Polestar 2, and its track is 20 mm wider. Additionally, the wheel arches are wider to fit the Akebono front brakes and the 275/30R21 Pirelli PZero Rosso performance tires from the Polestar 1. The suspension springs are stiffer (up 80 percent in front, 40 percent more in back), and Polestar added a carbon fiber front suspension strut bar from a Volvo S60 Polestar Engineered to make the EV even more rigid. The Experimental Polestar 2 gets performance boosts as well, with the power output increased to 476 horsepower from the standard long-range, dual-motor Polestar 2's 408 hp. The annual Goodwood festival is an important space for Polestar. The brand debuted a prototype version of the Polestar 1 to the public there back in 2018. Polestar's then-chief test driver, Joakim Rydholm, now the company's chief chassis engineer, drove that car. Rydholm will take the experimental Polestar 2 on hill-climb runs during this year's event.The EV that will be on hand at Goodwood this year is not the only special Polestar 2 in existence. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said that he's been driving a different experimental version, nicknamed 'Beast,' on the company's Gothenburg campus. The Beast inspired the Goodwood version, but Polestar revealed no performance details for that EV.Polestar will soon add more models to its small lineup; the limited-edition Polestar 1 will soon end production. The brand unveiled a concept vehicle called the Precept that will inform a future production model, and a Polestar 3 electric SUV is also in the works.\",\n",

But there is variety to be found in that small lineup, as the brand's appearance at the Goodwood Festival of Speed shows.This year, Polestar brought an experimental version of the Polestar 2 to highlight what is possible when the company's engineers flex a bit. The new EV is painted in Snow Matte and looks mostly like a standard Polestar 2. Look closer, though, and you will see a lot of tweaks here and there. Both the front and rear bumpers are slightly different, and there's a conspicuous Magnesium Matte racing stripe running down the middle. The gloss black side mirrors stand out from the black-and-white grille and two-tone 21-inch wheels.The experimental vehicle is 30 millimeters lower than a stock Polestar 2, and its track is 20 mm wider. Additionally, the wheel arches are wider to fit the Akebono front brakes and the 275/30R21 Pirelli PZero Rosso performance tires from the Polestar 1. The suspension springs are stiffer (up 80 percent in front, 40 percent more in back), and Polestar added a carbon fiber front suspension strut bar from a Volvo S60 Polestar Engineered to make the EV even more rigid. The Experimental Polestar 2 gets performance boosts as well, with the power output increased to 476 horsepower from the standard long-range, dual-motor Polestar 2's 408 hp. The annual Goodwood festival is an important space for Polestar. The brand debuted a prototype version of the Polestar 1 to the public there back in 2018. Polestar's then-chief test driver, Joakim Rydholm, now the company's chief chassis engineer, drove that car. Rydholm will take the experimental Polestar 2 on hill-climb runs during this year's event.The EV that will be on hand at Goodwood this year is not the only special Polestar 2 in existence. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said that he's been driving a different experimental version, nicknamed 'Beast,' on the company's Gothenburg campus. The Beast inspired the Goodwood version, but Polestar revealed no performance details for that EV.Polestar will soon add more models to its small lineup; the limited-edition Polestar 1 will soon end production. The brand unveiled a concept vehicle called the Precept that will inform a future production model, and a Polestar 3 electric SUV is also in the works.\",\n",

The map joins the two existing round-based Zombies maps, and will be available July 15 with the mid-season update.Watch on YouTubeAs you might have guessed from the recent teasers, Mauer Der Toten takes place in Berlin in February, 1985. The events follow on from Outbreak's Operation Excision, the most recent chapter in the Zombies story. Requiem agents are captured and threatened by Kravchenko, and must work for him to stay alive.Mauer Der Toten has one of the most unique settings for a Zombies map. Taking place in metropolitan downtown Berlin, fighting will take place on city streets, narrow hallways of apartment buildings, and even rooftops. You'll spot ziplines that get you from one rooftop to another, and there's an underground section with what looks to be running trains.Mauer Der Toten also introduces a new Wonder Weapon \\u2013 the CRBR-S \\u2013 which can be modified into four different variants. There's the return of the Mule Kick perk, which lets you equip a third weapon, and new enemy types to fight.All of this arrives alongside some big balance tweaks to zombie health, which you can read in full on the Treyarch blog.

      "      \"summary\": \"July 09, 2021 04:42 AM Eastern Daylight Time LONDEN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Britse bedrijven worstelen met meerdere dringende uitdagingen op het gebied van cyberbeveiliging, zo heeft nieuw onderzoek van Keeper Security onthuld. Uit het Cybersecurity Census Report van 2021 blijkt dat cyberaanvallen wreder, frequenter en geavanceerder worden, terwijl Britse bedrijven onvoldoende voorbereid en te traag zijn om deze aanvallen tegen te gaan. Als gevolg hiervan zijn senior leiders binnen Britse organisaties bezig met het spelen van een cyberaanval-schuldspel in plaats van te investeren in het versterken van hun verdediging.\\n\\nUit het rapport blijkt dat meer dan negen op de tien (92%) Britse bedrijven in de afgelopen 12 maanden een cyberaanval hebben gehad en driekwart (78%) voelt zich niet voorbereid om met deze dreiging om te gaan. Bijna een derde (31%) is van mening dat CTO's de schuld moeten krijgen in het geval van een succesvolle cyberaanval. Een dergelijk gewicht van verantwoordelijkheid betekent dat de cyberbeveiligingsnormen dalen: 36% van de senior IT-leiders geeft toe een cyberaanval voor zichzelf te hebben gehouden, terwijl 32% toegeven dat ze zwakke referenties zoals \\u2018wachtwoord' of \\u2018admin' gebruiken om hun gegevens te beschermen.\\n\\nDeze bekendmaking is officieel geldend in de originele brontaal.

      "      \"excerpt\": \"Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders, which the company has announced as its first Android phone, is going to cost a bomb in India.\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is the latest top-shelf phone, particularly suited for mobile gaming, that joins the elite club of flagships. This is Qualcomm's first Android phone that it has built in collaboration with Asus, and it has a Snapdragon 888 chipset, a 144Hz display, and gaming-centric features, among others. The phone will arrive in the US and some other markets in August. It will also come to India, but a bit later. When? I am not sure. However, Asus seems to have let the cat out of the bag. Asus has listed the phone on its India website to reveal how much the Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will cost in India. Since Qualcomm has not given a particular launch date of its new gaming phone for India, it did not think so much as announcing the Indian price of the Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders. But Asus has jumped the gun here. It has listed the phone with the 'Notify me' option, along with the price for the Indian market. The Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is going to cost you a bomb in India, and it is surprisingly lower than what the Dollar-Rupee conversion projects. That is one thing. Qualcomm is making another bizarre choice for the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders, but this time, it is exclusive to India. So, the Indian Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will not feature 65W charging as the US variant will. Instead, you will have only 30W charging support on the Indian variant, and that does not make sense either. Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders price in IndiaAccording to the Asus India website, the Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will cost Rs 1,11,990 in India. Now, the phone will cost $1,499 in the US, which translates to approximately Rs 1,12,200, so, you see, the phone is going to be marginally cheaper in India than the US. But that is not going to hide the fact that this is a bizarre price for a phone that is as frilled as the Asus ROG Phone 5 for a gaming phone. And the Asus ROG Phone 5 costs Rs 49,999 for the entry-level model. If we take into account the 16GB RAM and 512GB storage version, the Rs 1,11,990 price tag does not make sense.The Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is clearly a phone for people with money and without the understanding of value-for-money.Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders featuresThe Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is an outcome of the partnership between Qualcomm and Asus. This means everything you see on the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders (can we have an easier name for this phone, Qualcomm?) is going to look familiar to those who either own a ROG Phone or know about it. You have the top-end Snapdragon 888 processor obviously, but Snapdragon 888 Plus would have been better. Qualcomm said that the development of the phone began last year, while the Plus variant of the processor came into existence only recently.Other specifications of the Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders include a 6.78-inch Full-HD+ AMOLED display with up to 144Hz refresh rate, 1,200 nits of peak brightness, support for HDR and HDR10+, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection. There is 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB of internal storage. There is support for both mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G bands on the phone.The gaming phone has a 64-megapixel Sony IMX686 sensor on the primary camera, along with a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera. Qualcomm is touting its Qualcomm's Spectra 580 image signal processor will give better photos and up to 8K-resolution videos with the AI Zoom feature. On the front, the phone has a 24-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. The Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders has a 4000mAh battery with Quick Charge 5.0 technology with 65W output, but the India variant is not going to get that. According to the Asus India website, Qualcomm will bring only a 30W charger for the Indian Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders for some reason.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"MESSAGING IS AN intimate medium for sharing private views and sentiments. It is a cocktail-party whisper in digital form, as one user of WhatsApp, a service owned by Facebook, put it. Now some of the world's biggest brands are venturing into this personal realm. Aware of the limitations of conventional communication channels like call centres and email, a few years ago firms started using WhatsApp and its sister app, Facebook Messenger, as well as Apple's iMessage and independent apps such as Line.The pandemic gave all such apps a fillip. Messaging on Instagram, Facebook's photo-sharing app, and on Messenger rose by 40%. Four-fifths of mobile-device time is now spent on chat apps. Companies can usually be relied upon to go where customers are, so messaging has become vital for business, not just experimental, says Javier Mata, founder of Yalo, a startup whose technology connects firms to messaging platforms. Firms once used them chiefly for customer service. Now they want to get people to buy stuff via chat, as hundreds of millions of Chinese do on WeChat, owned by Tencent, China's mightiest tech giant.Because many popular messaging platforms are encrypted, data on transactions are hard to come by. But growth is undoubtedly happening. Over 1bn people now interact with businesses via chat, not counting China. Each day 175m people send a message to WhatsApp business accounts (WhatsApp channels designed for companies). Yalo's customers include consumer-goods giants such as Coca-Cola, Nestl\\u00e9, PepsiCo and Unilever, as well as Walmart, the world's biggest retailer. Apple Business Chat, which started in 2017, is used by Home Depot DIY stores, Hilton hotels and Burberry, a fashion brand. Facebook's roster includes Sephora, a cosmetics retailer, and IKEA, a furniture giant. LVMH, a French luxury-goods conglomerate, is testing out messaging, according to Jeroen van Glabbeek, chief executive of CM.com, a Dutch conversational-commerce platform.'C-commerce' is already entrenched in Asia and Latin America, where spotty access to broadband and high-quality devices puts e-commerce and company-specific apps out of reach for many. Now Western consumers are beginning to embrace the ease, speed, personalisation and convenience of messaging. For firms, the return on investment seems higher for messaging than for call-centre exchanges or email chains, says Emile Litvak, head of business messaging at Facebook.Boosters of business messaging claim that c-commerce will displace e-commerce within a decade or two. But messaging is best understood as a refinement of e-commerce, and a sibling of 'social commerce' (shopping on social media). Most messaging conversations between large firms and consumers start from corporate e-commerce websites equipped with a 'click to message' button. Plenty begin on social networks.In some ways c-commerce is a throwback to the past. Apart from mail order and its modern guise, online shopping, trade has relied on conversation for millennia. Yet business messaging does have new elements. It is more personalised than SMS marketing, which has itself had success in recent years in America and Europe. Automatic messaging is moving beyond rudimentary chatbots, which have been around since the mid-2010s. Artificial intelligence (AI) is getting better at unstructured exchanges that shoppers used to have with expert retail assistants.For now, says Marc Lore, who led Walmart's digital efforts, a lot of business messaging has humans in the loop. In future, he reckons, AI will be able to answer customer requests as fuzzy as 'get me a birthday toy for a five-year-old around science education for roughly $40', suggesting choices and completing the transaction in seconds. And when AI gets better at natural dialogue, as it will after learning from human interactions, consumer-to-business messaging may sound if not exactly like J.A.R.V.I.S, Tony Stark's digital butler in the Marvel comics, then close enough.Until that time, firms must tread delicately. Full of family and friends, chat apps are emotional spaces, says Robert Bennett, CEO of Rehab, an agency that helps brands reach consumers digitally. Try to sell someone yoga leggings after an exchange with their mother, he says, and your firm might find itself deleted faster than an ex. But get it right\\u2014think gentle reminder of evening meditation from a purveyor of herbal teas\\u2014and the rewards look tasty. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Chat-up lines\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"AN HOUR AFTER dawn Scott Sheffield is at the window of his 2,300-acre (930-hectare) Forked Lightning ranch in New Mexico, contemplating a day's fishing. The estate, formerly owned by Jane Fonda, has four miles of river running through it. It's muddy at the moment, he says, but on a good day a fly fisherman can easily pull out 20 or so rainbow trout. It is a dreamy-sounding place, with pine-covered cliffs and roving elk. It is another world from the tumbleweed-strewn oilfields of West Texas where Mr Sheffield was once dubbed the 'mother-fracker' for his role in turning the Permian Basin into the mother lode of America's shale boom.The last time your columnist spoke to Mr Sheffield, five years ago, the co-founder and boss of Pioneer Natural Resources was the Permian's greatest free-market evangelist. It was the heyday of the shale revolution. Pioneer was in the middle of a drilling bonanza that pushed its oil output up by an average of 15-20% a year for a decade. All the money it earned, it reinvested into fracking even more shale wells. Mr Sheffield was fond of comparing the Permian with Ghawar, Saudi Arabia's biggest oilfield.That drilling mania made revolutionaries of Mr Sheffield and his fellow frackers. It helped them usurp the role of OPEC, the Saudi-led cartel, as price-setter of last resort in the global oil market. It reduced American dependence on imported crude, creating what then-President Donald Trump called America's 'energy dominance'. Yet it came at a cost. To keep the rigs running the shale producers burned through Wall Street cash. They flirted with ruin last year when oil prices crashed in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. Led by Mr Sheffield, some even borrowed a leaf from OPEC's book, urging the Railroad Commission of Texas, a state regulator, to order production curbs to rescue the oil market.It didn't need to. Oil prices have since rebounded, with American crude briefly hitting a six-year high on July 6th after OPEC and Russia failed to agree among themselves on how much to increase output. But it is now the shale industry, not OPEC, that casts itself as the guardian of high prices. Amid self-imposed production restraints, it prefers showering investors with cash rather than flooding the world with cheap crude. This may worry users of oil\\u2014and inflation hawks. But it is economically rational. It is also deeply ironic. Just when climate change is making investing in oil unfashionable, the shale industry is finally becoming investable. If the self-restraint lasts, forget the revolutionary notion that America's shale industry will be a fleet-footed source of supply in a tightly squeezed global oil market. Its mantra might just as well be 'Keep it in the ground.'Mr Sheffield, 69, embodies the transformation. In 2016 he hung up his oilman's boots and retired to his ranch. It was a short-lived move. In 2019 he came back to the helm of Pioneer, convinced that two things threatened the future of the shale industry. One was its tendency to pump too much oil, even when it was unprofitable to do so. The other was the growing sense that oil demand would peak as electric vehicles gained traction and efforts to prevent climate change ramped up. He realised that to attract investors, the industry needed to reinvent itself. It is doing so in several ways.Start with production. These days frackers prefer to brag about how little oil and gas they produce, rather than how much. Pioneer, the Permian's biggest producer, promises no more than 5% annual volume growth for several years. On June 30th ConocoPhillips, another big producer, went further, pledging 3% annual output growth over the next decade. With less investment, as well as higher prices per barrel, the rewards come in cash, not crude. Rystad, an energy consultancy, predicts that America's shale industry will generate almost $350bn in free cashflow this year, a record. Much of that will go to shareholders. Over the next five years, Mr Sheffield predicts that energy firms will be the biggest dividend-payers in the S&P 500. Unsurprisingly, investors are delighted. Pioneer's share price, a laggard for half a decade, is up by more than 40% this year. That of ConocoPhillips has risen by 50%.Next comes consolidation. This is another way to please investors, especially when transactions are done with equity, not debt, and a more concentrated market means even less oversupply. ConocoPhillips has acquired Concho, a big Permian producer, and Pioneer has bought two shale producers, Parsley and DoublePoint Energy, both of which sit on land adjacent to it. Mr Sheffield says the deals will further improve production discipline. Pioneer has reduced the number of drilling rigs used by both.Last, the industry is sprucing itself up to appeal to the environmental, social and governance (ESG) brigade. That sounds barmy, considering that the use of oil and gas is a leading cause of climate change. But by reducing gas-flaring and methane leaks, frackers believe they can attract yet more investors. Unlike oil giants such as ExxonMobil and Chevron, Pioneer is not under pressure from ESG investors to curb oil production for environmental reasons, says Mr Sheffield. Rather it is for economic reasons: higher dividends. Furthermore, he doubts that even drillers without public shareholders, such as those backed by private equity, are raring to go on a production spree. They have too much to lose. He thinks that oil is headed to around $80 a barrel, which would be good for producers, yet, based on past experience, would not hurt demand, he adds.The capriciousness of capitalThat is the optimistic view. Investors are fickle, though. As Bobby Tudor of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, an investment bank, says, if oil prices keep rising there may be a premium on firms with high production growth. Mr Sheffield insists the industry will not be swayed, having finally found a business model that works. 'I'm sorry it took us so long,' he quips. Eventually he intends to retire again\\u2014at which point, he says, he plans to enjoy those dividends. All the more so, presumably, as he casts a fly over a pool of trout. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Keeping it in the ground\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

Already, they are giving a good number of artists and behind the scenes creatives and technicians much needed jobs given the pandemic, and hopefully they can and will do more for Philippine showbiz. So let's support them and watch GVBoys on its premiere today and its weekly episodes. It's free-to-stream as well and definitely a win all around.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"A person receives the Sinovac coronavirus disease vaccine as the Thai resort island of Phuket rushes to vaccinate its population amid the Covid-19 outbreak ahead of a July 1 end of strict quarantine for overseas visitors to bring back tourism revenue, in Phuket. - Reuters KUALA LUMPUR: Domestic travel will kickstart the recovery of Asean's tourism sector with full recovery hinging on vaccination rates, according to panelists at Maybank Kim Eng's webinar. Entitled 'Is Asean Tourism Dead?' the webinar held on Thursday revealed there was pent-up demand for domestic destinations due to the long-term desire of consumers to travel while a technology for a vaccine passport could be developed quickly. Tim Hughes, vice president, corporate development, Agoda, said: 'When consumers come back, they come back for domestic first: the 'driveable' markets around them, two to three hours outside of their capital city. 'But then very quickly, they are prepared to get back on airplanes. We saw that in Thailand, Vietnam and to a lesser extent, Malaysia.' Hughes pointed out these three markets saw domestic destinations that were not in the Top 10 before now becoming popular. 'People were keen to get out of cities and into the countryside, up into the highlands or to the beaches. We actually saw a surprising number of people shifting up a star rating. They weren't necessarily looking for the cheapest trip, ' he said. Benito C. Bengzon Jr., Undersecretary for Tourism Development, Department of Tourism, the Philippines noted that even before the onset of Covid-19, the country enjoyed a healthy domestic tourism sector, registering 110 million domestic trips that generated revenue five times bigger than revenue from inbound trips. 'What we've seen over the last couple of months is that there's been a lot of interest in opening up travel bubbles. We've been talking very closely, for example, with our partners in South Korea. What we've found is that there continues to be very strong demand for our island destinations, ' Benito added. The return of international visitors is important to the recovery of the tourism industry in Asean. This is especially true for Chinese tourists, whom accounted for a quarter of total tourist arrivals in Asean during pre-COVID times in 2019, based on Maybank Kim Eng Research data. Markland Blaiklock, deputy CEO, Central Plaza Hotel Group was optimistic as he expected Chinese tourists will return. 'The pace remains to be seen, but I'm sure the demand is as strong as ever, if not stronger. People from China will be looking for more varied experiences and sampling other things that they perhaps didn't in the past, ' he said. The panelists agreed that to support the return of international visitors, countries were unlikely to wait for a return to zero cases before resuming travel. Instead, vaccination rates and health and safety protocols are seen as key to full reopening. The Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are expected to have 70% of their populations vaccinated by the end of 2021, according to data compiled by Maybank Kim Eng Research. The full reopening of ASEAN's six largest countries for tourism is expected in early 2022. Hughes said the technology for a vaccine passport could be developed quickly, given the travel industry's years of experience in building fintech solutions. 'The technology to build a viable, secure, identity-confirmed passport is actually relatively easy. What we need is the data input from government. We need a way in which the governments agree on how they recognise the various vaccines people have received, ' he said. The webinar was the fifth in the Invest Asean 2021 series, Maybank Kim Eng's flagship annual investor conference that will run until August.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"SYDNEY: Asian shares stumbled to two-month lows on Friday and were set for their worst weekly performance since mid-May as confidence took a battering over the global spread of the Delta virus variant and worries it could stall a worldwide economic revival. European futures pointed to some stabilisation in the sell-off with Eurostoxx 50 futures and Germany's Dax Futures up 0.4% and London's FTSE futures rising 0.3%. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were a shade higher. The mood in Asia seemed to have improved too by late afternoon, though major indices were still in red zone. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan went as deep as 665.19, a level not seen since mid-May. It pared some of the losses to be last down 0.3% at 672.29. For the week so far, the index is down 2.6%, the biggest decline since mid-May. Japan's Nikkei skidded 0.6%. Chinese shares were weaker too with the blue-chip CSI300 index off 0.3%. Australian shares dropped 1.2%, with stay-at-home orders in Sydney, the country's most populous city, tightened further to stop the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Analysts said an accumulation of events have triggered a turn in sentiment rather than a single catalyst. Fears central banks will choke economic recovery by tightening policy in their efforts to rein in inflation, a rapidly spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus around the world and still low rates of vaccination have darkened the outlook. Also raising concerns for investors were political tensions in the Middle East, Russia and China while Beijing's crackdown on foreign-listed Chinese firms took its toll too. As a result, markets are now starting to question one of this year's most successful trades, the so called reflation narrative -- bets that assets that benefit from a strengthening economy and higher inflation will outperform steadier, safer ones. Overnight, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 2.8 basis points to 1.293%. It fell as low as 1.25% earlier in the day. The 30-year Treasury bond slipped 1.9 basis points to 1.925%. In equities, the Dow fell 0.7%, the S&P 500 lost 0.86% and the technology-focused Nasdaq dropped 0.7%. \\\"The rate move is a reflection of less accommodative Fed signals & some fading of reflation optimism with an uptick in COVID delta concerns,\\\" analysts at Bank of America Securities wrote in a note. \\\"We believe these factors may continue to pressure rates lower until the market stabilizes and finds a catalyst for rates to re-price back to levels consistent with fundamentals.\\\" In late Asian trading, yields on the 10-year paper had bounced to 1.329%, though still nowhere close to 2021 highs of 1.776% reached in March. Meanwhile, a reading on Thursday on the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims added to views that the job market recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be choppy. In currencies, the risk sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars were under pressure, down 0.1% each. The safe haven yen hovered near a one-month high at 110.01 per dollar. The euro dipped to $1.1834. That left the dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, slightly firmer at 92.452. Gold, another safe haven asset, was on track for its third straight weekly gain. It was last down 0.1% at $1,800 an ounce. Oil prices added to overnight gains. Brent crude was up 14 cents to $74.26 a barrel. U.S. crude added 23 cents to $73.17 per barrel. - Reuters\",\n",

But Gardner found, standing barefoot in the land of her ancestors, country also healed her.\\n\\n\\\"It was a really special experience to go out there with her and my Aunty Doris,\\\" she told cricket.com.au.\\n\\n\\\"It's very barren and dry, the landscape is very flat.\\n\\n\\\"The most special moment was a smoking ceremony to welcome us to the land as soon as we got out to a place called Ledknapper Reserve, which is Muruwari country and where my clan the Gandugari people are form.\\\"\\n\\nSitting on country around a campfire, Gardner enjoyed the novelty of being far from phone reception and the chance to simply be present, as she listened to stories of the past.\\n\\n\\\"We did it at a place called the spirit trees \\u2026 trees that nothing grows under,\\\" she continued.\\n\\n\\\"Aboriginal people, being really spiritual people, believe they hear the past people talking to them through the trees and the way the wind blows \\u2026 Murawari people say that as soon as you get out there, it starts to get really windy.\\n\\n\\\"We got to do a smoking ceremony and cleanse and heal and think about the people that came before us. That was one of the highlights of the trip.\\\"\\n\\nGardner learnt about traditional foods and medicines, and as she explored the land, found remnants of the life lived by her ancestors, and was presented with her personal totem by her Aunty Doris: the emu. Aunty Doris Shillingsworth is not only an influential figure in Gardner's life, she has also become a familiar figure with the Australian squad, after spending time educating the group last season.\\n\\nAshleigh's Aunt educates Aussies in NAIDOC Week\\n\\n\\\"Aunty Doris is a special person,\\\" Gardner said. \\\"She's an absolute character \\u2026 whenever you go out, everyone in the street knows who she is and she seems to know every single person.\\n\\n\\\"She's my cousin but out of respect, because she's an elder, we call her Aunty.\\n\\n\\\"My clan, the Gandugari people, have their special totem which is the sand goanna.\\n\\n\\\"Aunty Doris gave me my personal totem, the emu, because she saw traits from that animal in me ... it's really cool to have something personal to me that no-one else has in my close family.\\\"\\n\\nSince breaking into the Australian squad in 2017, Gardner, the third Indigenous Australian to wear the Baggy Green, has been a driving force behind her team's commitment to learning about and celebrating Indigenous culture.\\n\\nIn addition to facilitating education sessions between her teammates and Aunty Doris, her influence now sees the Australian team wear the Walkabout Wickets logo on the collar of their playing shirt, and every time they play or train at a new venue, they connect to country with a Barefoot Circle.\\n\\nNow, she hopes to take lessons learnt from her return to country to continue educating others.\\n\\nWBBL stars share the importance of NAIDOC Week\\n\\n\\\"That's the beauty of it and why I wanted to go out there, to learn more so I can be confident enough to educate others about my people and the culture in general,\\\" Gardner said.\\n\\n\\\"It was nice to listen to stories because that's how you learn.\\\"\\n\\nMaking the journey more special for Gardner was the fact she was able to travel alongside her mother, who was born in an Indigenous camp on Muruwari country in the 1970s.\\n\\nQUICK SINGLE Beyond Bourke to the Baggy Green\\n\\n\\\"To have her on that journey with me going out there for the first time was really incredible,\\\" Gardner reflected.\\n\\n\\\"She grew up going to and from country.\\n\\n\\\"We got to go back to where she spent a lot of her childhood. For her to experience that and for me to be there and re-live her childhood with her, remembering stories and the house where she used to stay, it was really cool to be out there with her.\\n\\n\\\"She's also on a learning journey as well, she knows a little more than me at the moment but we're trying to learn off each other and listen to stories.\\\"\",\n",

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (MMHE) expects to save about RM30mil in electricity bills over 21 years with the use of solar power at its shipyard. MMHE said on Friday its operation yard, MMHE West in Pasir Gudang, Johor is now powered by solar after the installation of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. The installation by M+ by Petronas, the solar solution brand of Petronas, is under a 21-year agreement until 2042. 'The installation of this 8.3 megawatt peak (MWp) solar rooftop at MMHE West represents the largest rooftop solar installation in a single compound within Malaysia., ' it said. The 18, 720 units of solar PV panels with a total size of 440, 496 square feet (sq ft) will provide energy for eight buildings at MMHE West. These panels collectively generate about 10, 000-megawatt hours (MWh) of clean energy each year translating to a reduction of about 6, 286 tonnes of carbon emissions into the atmosphere annually. This amounts to 132, 000 tonnes of carbon emissions reduced throughout the 21 years which is equivalent to planting two million trees. MMHE said the power generated from the solar PV panels is sufficient to light up 725 double-storey homes for a full year. The completion of the solar PV panels installation was commemorated via a virtual launching ceremony earlier on Friday by the mayor of Pasir Gudang City Council Datuk Asman Shah Abd Rahman, MMHE managing director and CEO Pandai Othman and the executive vice president & CEO of Petronas Gas + New Energy Adnan Zainal Abidin, . Pandai Othman said this was under Petronas' new energy segment as part of MMHE's sustainability efforts. 'With this in place, we will now be utilising clean and renewable energy for our operations and reducing our carbon footprint. 'As part of our mission to protect and preserve the environment and thus create a positive difference to the lives of the people, our efforts are not only for the profit of the Company, but for the benefit of all. We embrace and assume our responsibility in ensuring a sustainable world for the present and future generations, ' he added. Aside from the installation of solar PV panels, he said MMHE also has other environmental sustainability efforts in place which it is currently intensifying, including energy saving, waste management and water conservation. 'On the business side, we acknowledge the dynamics of the energy industry and have expanded our strategies in exploring opportunities in renewable energy sector which include the construction of offshore wind farm structures. To date, we have established partnerships with various international engineering solutions providers for that purpose, ' he said. Adnan Zainal said the rooftop solar installation at MMHE represents a new source of energy that helps transform MMHE's electricity mix to be more environmentally-friendly and highlights the real possibilities for clean energy to be used to power heavy and energy-intensive industries. 'Importantly, the effort to solarise MMHE West Yard forms a part of Petronas' transformative journey towards Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050, whereby we identify suitable internal assets owned by Petronas and its associates to grow the use of clean energy across Petronas Group of Companies, ' Adnan added.\",\n",

Officials added that an air horn will be used to signal the exit time. Videos on social media showed large numbers of tourists bathing at the falls without maintaining adequate Covid-19 safety protocols or social distancing norms. With a third wave of coronavirus being expected, experts are saying that vaccination is the only option to curb the extent of the impact of the third wave. The third wave is expected to reach its peak in the second week of August, according to a report by State Bank of India. The devastating events of the second wave ravaged the country in April-May bringing the healthcare system to its knees. Prime Minister Narendra Modi told his revamped council of ministers that there should be no scope for carelessness or complacency in establishing safety protocols. The Centre has cautioned people several times that ignoring Covid-19 protocols while roaming in hill-stations and marketplaces can nullify the gains made in controlling the pandemic thus far. The government stated that violations of Covid-19 safety protocols will lead to a further increase in the number of infections and that wearing masks and maintaining social distance is paramount.

      "      \"summary\": \"India Today Tech New Delhi, Jul 09, 2021, Updated Jul 09, 2021, 1:28 PM IST Story highlights Xiaomi is planning to raise around $1.2 billion. The money will be raise by issuing debt insurance. The initiative comes during China's crackdown on tech giants. Chinese electronics giant Xiaomi aims to raise around $1.2 billion via debt issuance at a time when authorities are cracking down on China's technology giants. According to company's latest regulatory filings, it aims to issue $800 million worth of bonds due in 2031 with a coupon of 2.875 per cent per year. It will raise another $400 million of so-called green bonds with a 4.1 per cent coupon per year. The proceeds will be used for \\\"general corporate purposes,\\\" the filing says. These may include Xiaomi's efforts to expand to different categories. The electronics maker has already entered multiple markets by now and has recently unveiled its plans to break into categories such as electric vehicles. Xiaomi had said that it would announce its own electric car business and invest $10 billion over the next 10 years. The Green bonds that the company plans to issue are the debt issued to raise money to support environmental projects. Xiaomi said the proceeds will go toward funding eligible projects under its \\\"Green Finance Framework,\\\" an environmental scheme. At least of these projects can be Xiaomi's expansion into the electric vehicle category. \\\"The group may reallocate the use of the net proceeds of the bonds issue in response to unforeseen events or changing business conditions,\\\" Xiaomi said. Bonds will be issued to professional investors only, it said. Interestingly, Xiaomi's announcement comes at a time when China has intensified scrutiny of the technology sector. Over the past year, the government has introduced a slew of legislation in areas from fintech to antitrust and data protection. Xiaomi has also had its set to troubles lately. It was caught in the geopolitical tensions between the US and China. At the beginning of this year, the then Trump administration designated Xiaomi as one of several Communist Chinese military companies or CCMC. This meant that Americans were restricted from holding Xiaomi's stocks. However, that had changed in March when a Court order blocked the earlier directive.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Story highlights Micromax IN 2C smartphone launch may not happen in July. A new report has said that its launch is likely to take place in August. Instead, Micromax may launched the IN 2B smartphone later this month. Micromax is about to launch a new phone in India. It is going to be a part of the IN series, and if rumours are anything to go by, this phone is called IN 2C. Now, the phone has already made its way to the Geekbench benchmarking platform, along with key specifications. And based on this listing, some reports have suggested the launch of the Micromax IN 2C will take place sometime in July. Meanwhile, another report has pointed at an August launch of the next Micromax IN smartphone. According to a report by The Mobile Indian, citing sources close to the matter, the launch of Micromax IN 2C will happen in August. A July launch is not possible, the sources told the publication, because the phone is \\\"still in the planning stage.\\\" However, Micromax could be looking at bringing another phone possibly by the end of July. The Indian phone company may launch the Micromax IN 2B smartphone later this month if things go as planned, according to the report. Besides the Micromax IN 2C, the IN 2B was also spotted recently on the Geekbench benchmarking platform. However, the rumours around IN 2C only gained momentum. Micromax has not said anything officially yet, but given the success of its IN brand, which it launched last year as a retort to the onslaught by Chinese phone brands, Micromax may soon go on a spree of phone launches. The IN brand already has three phones, IN Note 1, IN 1, and IN 1B. According to the Geekbench listing, the Micromax IN 2C may come with a Unisoc T-610 processor, which has two Cortex-A75 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz and six Cortex-A55 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz. This Unisoc processor is coupled with the Mali-G52 GPU for graphics. The listing has revealed the IN 2C will have 4GB of RAM, but it is possible there will be more storage variants of the phone. The internal storage is not clear, but you can expect at least 32GB of memory on the phone. The Micromax IN 2C will also be the first phone to come with Android 11 out-of-the-box. The Geekbench platform also shows scores for the phone. The IN 2C scored 347 in the single-core test and 1127 in the multi-core test. The Micromax IN 2C is expected to cost below Rs 10,000, but since there is no confirmation from Micromax yet, take this with a pinch of salt. Micromax's latest phone, the IN 1 is a pretty good phone for its price. It impressed me with its speed, camera capabilities, display, and battery life. In my review, I wrote, \\\"Micromax is giving hope to Indian buyers who are reluctant to go for a Chinese phone. I have met several such people who frown at the name of a brand that has a Chinese association. Micromax serves those people, in addition to luring those who do not care about the origin of the smartphone brand. It is a little less compelling for the latter to go for Micromax, which has re-emerged after a long time because they would rather go for Redmi or Realme. But In 1 can make it happen.\\\"\",\n",

The company has confirmed the upcoming launch through a teaser page on its official website. No specific launch date has yet been confirmed, though. The Zenfone 8 and the Zenfone 8 Flip were introduced globally by Asus back on May 12. At the time, the Taiwanese tech major delayed its launch for India due to the second wave of Covid-19 that had hit the country. It is now working towards the release of smartphones in the Indian market soon. Other than the teaser on its website, Asus India business head Dinesh Sharma has confirmed the same in a recent tweet. In response to several queries on the smartphone, Sharma tweeted that the Asus team is working towards the launch of the Zenfone 8 series, and the launch date for the phones will be announced soon. Other than the upcoming launch, the teaser website also lists some of the specifications and features of the smartphones.

RBI continues with its efforts to calm the nerves of the market and revive sectors with both backward and forward linkages and multiplier effects on growth,\\\" the report said. \\\"With rapid and focused COVID-19 vaccination efforts, India's average daily vaccination rate in June 2021 has doubled to 41.3 lakh doses compared to 19.3 lakh in May, crossing the 36 crore mark in its cumulative vaccination coverage,\\\" the report added. The report said inflationary pressures took an upturn in May 2021 with headline inflation (CPI-C) and WPI inflation touching a high of 6.3 percent and 12.94 per cent respectively. \\\"Supply side disruptions in states and unfavourable base effects drove the broad-based momentum in retail inflation across food, fuel and core categories,\\\" the report said. \\\"Healthy monsoon coverage, gradually rising Kharif sowing and unlocking of states is expected to ease food, and thereby headline inflation. However, risks due to global demand-led recovery in commodity prices and input cost pressures remain,\\\" it added. Substantiating its claim on the \\u2018signs of revival', the DEA report points to GST e-way bills volumes, power consumption and vehicle registrations. \\\"India is on the move again with the total volume of e-way bills rising by 37.1 per cent in June 2021 over May 2021 and 26 per cent YoY. This augurs well for GST collections in subsequent months,\\\" said the report. This essentially means that monthly GST revenue which fell below the Rs 1 lakh crore mark in June after eight months of buoyant revenues may remain above the psychological level in the next month.\\u00a0 The report also said that power consumption growth improved to 4.5 per cent sequentially in June 2021 over May and 8.4 per cent YoY, even though it remained slightly below pre-COVID 2019 levels. \\\"Rail freight continues to sustain its momentum with freight loading higher by 11 per cent in June 2021 compared to June 2019 and 20 per cent higher compared to June 2020. While localised lockdowns and mobility restrictions dented automobile sales in May 2021, June data on vehicle registrations depict revitalisation of demand as states unlock,\\\" the report added.

If they are successful, they are rewarded with cash. Tech giants like Facebook and Microsoft organise bug bounty programmes rewarding their bounty hunters to help improve their system. \\\"The Zomato Bug Bounty Program is a crucial part of our security efforts and we hope that this improvement will further motivate the hacker community. Thank you for your contribution to our program so far and we look forward to your reports!\\\" the food delivery platform said in a statement. Zomato in its disclosure policy noted that the hackers or bounty hunters should inform the company as soon as possible after discovering a potential security issue, and should also give Zomato enough time to resolve the issue before disclosure to a third party and to ensure that privacy and data is not violated.

This comes after initial data from an ongoing trial that showed a third dose pushed the levels of Covid-19 antibodies between five to 10 times higher against the original coronavirus strain and the Beta variant, that was found first in South Africa, as compared with the first two doses of the vaccine. In the coming weeks, the companies are expected to provide more definitive data as well as a plan which they will submit to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), the EMA (European Medicines Agency) and other regulatory authorities, according to AFP. Additionally, the companies also expect the third dose to perform well against the highly transmissible Delta strain, which is rapidly spreading around the world. Also read: Big global worry! Pfizer vaccine less effective against Delta variant Keeping this in mind, companies are developing a Delta-specific vaccine, the first batch of which is being developed in BioNTech's facility in Mainz, Germany. If regulatory approvals are obtained, clinical studies are anticipated to begin by August 2021. Israel, meanwhile, has witnessed drops in the efficacy rates of the vaccine despite two doses. Considering this, companies are saying that a third dose would be needed within six to 12 months after full vaccination. A statement by the companies said that continued emergence of variants is expected. While the vaccines protected against severe disease, a decline in efficacy against symptomatic disease over time was observed. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with the FDA released a joint statement late on Thursday stating that authorities were considering \\\"whether or when a booster might be necessary\\\", as reported by the news site.

      "      \"summary\": \"ECONOMYNEXT \\u2013 The overall human rights situation in Sri Lanka continued to deteriorate in 2020, the UK's annual report on human rights and democracy said.\\nTitled \\u2018Human Rights and Democracy: 2020 Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office report\\u2018, the document noted an alleged increase in surveillance and intimidation of civil society, limited or no progress with regard to accountability, militarisation and other issues.\\n'The government of Sri Lanka delivered free and peaceful parliamentary elections despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and maintained low numbers of COVID-19 cases compared to global figures. However, there was increased surveillance and intimidation of civil society, constraints placed on communities practising religious burial rites, a number of lengthy detentions without charge, and several setbacks on post-conflict accountability and reconciliation,' it said.\\nNoting Sri Lanka's withdrawal from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolutions 30/1, 34/1, and 40/1 on post-conflict transitional justice, accountability and reconciliation, the UK report said there was no progress shown by Sri Lanka despite the government announcing its commitment to a domestic mechanism for reconciliation and accountability.\\n'The UK made clear its commitment to reconciliation and accountability in statements delivered on behalf of the Core Group on Sri Lanka at the HRC in February, June and September,' the report said.\\nIn June 2021, the core group, comprising, Canada, Germany, North Macedonia, Malawi, Montenegro and the UK, expressed concern over what it called the lack of progress with regard to human rights, the rights of religious minorities and other issues highlighted in resolution 46/1.\\nRelated: UNHRC core group concerned over Sri Lanka's lack of progress on human rights\\nThe UK report, dated July 08 2021, said Sri Lanka's commitment to accountability was further called into question in March 2020 when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa pardoned and released former Army Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake, who was convicted in 2015 for the murder of eight civilians (including children) in Jaffna in 2000.\\nRatnayake, who was attached to the long range reconnaissance patrol of the army, was sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court in June 2015 for his alleged involvement in the Mirusuvil massacre in 2000. The former soldier, who was the first accused in the case, was found guilty of the murder of eight civilians including three children. He was pardoned by President Rajapaksa on March 26, days after an island-wide curfew was declared to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.\\nAmnesty Intentional, too, said in May last year that in pardoning Ratnayake, the COVID-19 pandemic was exploited as an 'opportunity to reverse justice'\\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office report further said the President continued to appoint controversial military figures accused of war crimes to government roles, while civilian functions such as the Secretariat for Non-Governmental Organisations were brought under the control of the Ministry of Defence. In October, the government passed the 20th amendment to the constitution, which the report said extended executive power over appointments to the judiciary and independent institutions, and reversed several important institutional checks and balances.\\n'In March, the President dissolved parliament ahead of elections, which were then twice postponed because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Although the government went on to deliver peaceful and democratic elections in August, the delay resulted in a lack of parliamentary oversight between March and August. The government instead formed several presidential \\u2018taskforces' without parliamentary scrutiny, including to oversee the COVID-19 response,' the report said.\\nThe report was also critical of the government's widely condemned move in March 2020 to cremate Muslim victims of COVID-19 against the wishes of the community with little or no scientific basis to the decision. World Health Organisation guidelines had also permitted burials.\\n'This particularly affected Muslim and some Christian communities, for whom burial is an essential rite. In December, the Supreme Court dismissed several petitions that challenged this policy. The outbreak of COVID-19 also led to an increase in anti-Muslim sentiment, fuelled by hate speech and disinformation suggesting that Muslims were \\u2018carriers' of COVID-19 and were violating prevention measures. In June, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, expressed concern over the clampdown on freedom of expression, noting an announcement made by the police in April to arrest those critical of the Government's COVID-19 response,' the report said.\\nThe report also made references to allegations that judicial medical officers and police had conducted invasive intimate examinations on LGBT+ persons without their consent, following which the Justice Minister Ali Sabry gave instructions to halt and investigate the practice.\\nThe Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) has been a running theme in international pronouncements on Sri Lanka's human rights record. The European parliament moved a resolution on June 10 calling for its release.\\nRelated: EU parliament adopts resolution on Sri Lanka; wants PTA repealed, GSP+ withdrawn\\nThe UK report on Sri Lanka's human rights situation in 2020, too, noted that the government of Sri Lanka continued to use the PTA, despite a renewed pledge at the 43rd session of the UNHRC to review the legislation.\\n'In April, prominent human rights lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah was arrested by Sri Lanka's Criminal Investigation Department under the PTA. Hejaaz was detained without charge or presentation before a court. International rights groups noted an increase in intimidation, surveillance and online abuse, including threats to lawyers, journalists, families of disappeared persons and individuals working on human rights and anti-corruption.'\\nRiots in Sri Lanka's prisons in late 2020 were also highlighted in the report.\\n'In November, unrest at Mahara prison over COVID-19 concerns resulted in the death of eleven inmates and injury of over 150. A committee appointed to investigate the unrest concluded that the inmates' demands had been reasonable, and autopsies revealed that all inmates had died of gunshot wounds. In November, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka wrote to the Inspector General of Police to highlight an increase in deaths in custody, and released a prison study which noted that the treatment of prisoners fell below international standards,' it said.\\nRelated: Govt takes full responsibility for Mahara prison riot: Keheliya\\nThe UK will continue to press for progress on human rights, gender equality and protections for minorities and vulnerable groups in 2021, the report further said.\\n'We shall continue to invest in ambitious programmes which support conflict-affected communities, promote the role of civil society, facilitate social cohesion, and underline the critical importance of post-conflict reconciliation and accountability,' it added.

Also pressuring markets, Wall Street indexes pulled back from record closing highs overnight in a broad sell-off. In Japan, shares fell across the sectors, with shippers leading declines with a 4.4% drop. Restaurant operator Global-Dining lost 3.29% as the government is planning to take stricter measures against eateries that do not comply with the order to shorten business hours. The company earlier this year had filed a lawsuit against the Tokyo government claiming its order to close restaurants was illegal and not based on scientific evidence.

      "      \"summary\": \"Poco F3 GT India launch has been teased and it suggests a direct rivalry with the upcoming OnePlus Nord 2. The smartphone was confirmed to launch in the third quarter of 2021 and is expected to debut in the first half of August 2021. It is likely to be a rebranded variant of the Redmi K40 Gaming Edition that was launched in China in April. Poco initially put out a video teaser on Thursday hinting that the Poco F3 GT launch is really close.\\n\\nThis was followed by another tweet where Poco used OnePlus' Nord 2 announcement to promote its own smartphone. Not your N-ordinary phone the tweet read. None of these posts have suggested at any official launch date but have led to speculations that Poco might unveil the device on July 22 the same date when OnePlus is introducing its Nord 2.\\n\\nIt will be an interesting battle in the mid-premium category as both the devices will be powered by the same MediaTek Dimensity 1200 SoC. This will make the Poco F3 GT company's only second smartphone to be powered by MediaTek processor. Meanwhile, the OnePlus Nord 2 will be company's first to use a MediaTek chip.\\n\\nThe sneak peek hints at the presence of game triggers on one side of the phone. This further confirms that the new phone can be the rebranded Redmi K40 Gaming Edition that came with similar-looking game trigger buttons. Poco has followed a similar strategy in the past.\\n\\nThe Poco F3 GT may come with a 6.67-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 480Hz touch sampling rate, HDR10+, and punch-hole cutout for the selfie shooter. The Poco F3 GT is expected to be powered with the MediaTek Dimensity 1200 SoC coupled with up to 12GB RAM and 256GB storage that is further expandable via a microSD card.\\n\\nThe smartphone is likely to feature a 64-megapixel primary sensor, an 8-megapixel wide-angle lens, and a 2-megapixel macro lens. There is a 16-megapixel camera on the front for selfies. The phone should feature a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for security and may ship with Android 11-based MIUI 12.\",\n",

The broader Nifty 50 index is trading below its 21-day moving average, signalling an impending downward trend in the market. Major lenders HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank declined 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively, and were the top drags on the Nifty Bank index that fell 0.9%. The Nifty Auto index extended losses, falling 0.54%. For the week so far, it shed 2.52%. Among global markets, Asian shares hit a two-month low as the global spread of the Delta virus variant left investors worried of a stalled worldwide economic recovery.

      "      \"summary\": \"The previously unreported timeline raises fresh questions about how Ng could have maintained an alleged S$1.46 billion ($1.08 billion) fraud for so long. Even as OCBC and UOB cut ties with the trader, other banks including DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. still had relationships with him at the time he was charged, people familiar with the matter said. Ng continued accepting money from wealthy Singaporeans until his arrest, enticing them with purported investment gains that averaged 15% a quarter. Prosecutors and court-appointed judicial managers of Ng's companies allege that he was in fact fabricating trades and misappropriating client money to finance a S$2 million-a-month spending habit that included private jet travel, a personal butler and nightclub outings.All told, Ng funneled about S$475 million from his companies -- Envy Asset Management and Envy Global Trading -- into his personal accounts, according to an interim report from the judicial managers led by Bob Yap of KPMG LLP, who have proposed liquidation for the firms. Ng's case has riveted Singapore's moneyed elite and thrust a spotlight on the challenges of developing effective early warning systems for fraud even in the most advanced financial centers. Assets under management in Singapore swelled by 17% last year to a record $3.5 trillion. \\\"For international financial centers, the difficulty in detecting financial scams may be exacerbated due to the sheer volume and complexity of transactions, ' said Nizam Ismail, founder of Singapore-based Etikom Consultancy, which advises firms on compliance. Ng, who has been out on bail, has yet to enter a plea and his lawyer didn't respond to an email seeking comment. \\\"It is inappropriate to comment on ongoing police investigations, ' a spokesperson for Singapore's police department said. Spokespeople at CIMB and OCBC declined to comment on Ng's accounts. Loretta Yuen, OCBC's group head of legal and regulatory compliance, said transactions that are found to be suspicious or unusual are reported to the authorities. A DBS spokesperson said the bank maintains \\\"robust systems' and controls to identify and report suspicious transactions. \\\"We cooperate fully with law enforcement efforts, and this includes account freezing and property seizures, ' the spokesperson said. \\\"As a matter of policy, we do not comment on cases under investigation.' Corporate Accounts DBS filed suspicious transaction reports to Singapore police on Ng's corporate accounts and was in the process of closing them before he was arrested, a person familiar with the matter said. Ng allegedly misappropriated at least S$201 million from Envy Global Trading's account at DBS, according to charge sheets seen by Bloomberg. HSBC Holdings Plc, where Ng had a personal account, also filed STRs between 2019 and 2020, a person familiar said. The police later froze Ng's personal account at HSBC, people familiar with the matter said, without specifying when that happened. An HSBC spokesman declined to comment on Ng's accounts but said the bank has measures in place to spot suspicious transactions. A UOB representative declined to comment. A spokesman for Malayan Banking Bhd., which is listed in the judicial managers' report among banks that dealt with Ng's companies, also declined to comment. The report showed no money in the Maybank account, suggesting it had been closed, although the timing wasn't clear. The judicial managers have described the pattern of transactions in Ng's accounts as \\\"highly unusual.' Between July 2020 and February 2021, there were about 150 transfers a month, on average, from Envy corporate accounts to Ng's personal ones, according to an interim report by the judicial managers in May. Global banks are required by most major financial centers, including Singapore, to alert authorities to suspect activity via suspicious transaction reports.These so-called STRs can help expose possible fraud, but they're not always easy to analyze quickly given the high volume of reports, according to Oonagh van den Berg, managing director of Virtual Risk Solutions in Hong Kong, a consultancy firm that offers advisory and training services on compliance. Investor Alert In Singapore alone, about 33, 571 STRs were filed on average each year from 2016 and 2019, according to data from the Commercial Affairs Department, the white-collar unit of the Singapore Police Force. \\\"Generally banks are risk averse, and would err on the side of caution' when it comes to filing a STR, said Chenthil Kumarasingam, a partner at law firm Withers KhattarWong. \\\"This is understandable given the rigorous regulatory oversight in Singapore.' Ng had appeared on authorities' radar for a different reason as early as March 2020. That's when the Monetary Authority of Singapore put Envy Asset Management on its \\\"Investor Alert List, ' which highlights companies that have been wrongly perceived as being licensed by the regulator. The alert did little to deter some investors, however, in part because Ng distributed a letter from a top Singapore law firm, Allen & Gledhill LLP, expressing its opinion that Envy Asset didn't need to be licensed by MAS because it wasn't providing a fund management service as defined by the regulator, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ng was also honoring withdrawal requests, giving clients little reason to suspect wrongdoing, another person said. As for banks, they aren't required to stop dealing with entities on the investor alert list. MAS said in a response to questions from Bloomberg this month that it received \\\"additional information' on Ng's companies between May and September 2020 and subsequently sent its findings to the police.Allen & Gledhill said in an emailed reply that the firm's advice was addressed only to Envy Asset and Envy Global, and not to be relied upon by anyone else. \\\"We did not advise on Envy's credit standing or the suitability of its products for investors, ' the firm said. \\\"We are not able to comment further due to client confidentiality.' Ng's companies had six bank accounts holding about $7.9 million as of April 30, according to the judicial managers' report. About 86% of that was in four accounts at DBS, with the remainder at CIMB. At least S$282.2 million of cash that investors gave to Ng's companies remains unaccounted for, the prosecutors have said in affidavits. - Bloomberg Join our Telegram channel to get our Evening Alerts and breaking news highlights\",\n",

KUALA LUMPUR: Political uncertainties, rising Covid-19 cases and the impact of the strict restrictions during the enhanced movement control order (EMCO) will weigh down Bursa Malaysia, CGS-CIMB Equities Research says. In its strategy note on Friday, it was concerned that opposition MPs are likely to seek to table a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin in the upcoming parliament session. Parliament, suspended since January this year, re-convenes on July 26 to August 2. CGS-CIMB Research said Umno's decision to withdraw support for Muhyiddin does not come as a surprise as the party had voiced its unhappiness with him since September 2020. 'We are of the view that opposition MPs are likely to seek to table a vote of no confidence against the PM in the upcoming parliament session. 'Overall, we are negative on this development as it leads to further uncertainties on the future leadership and policy directions of the country, ' it said. The research house said this comes on top of rising Covid-19 cases in the country as mass-testing is conducted in EMCO areas. CGS-CIMB Research said the market is likely to weaken or stay sideways due to corporate earnings and political uncertainty risks. 'Malaysian corporates are likely to report weaker 2Q earnings due to the implementation of MCO and EMCO. Political uncertainties will be negative for banks, construction, property sectors, as well as stocks with high foreign shareholding. 'Exporters (gloves, technology, plantations) and defensive plays (utilities and telcos) will be less affected. 'The KLCI could trade up to three standard deviation below its forward average P/E on these concerns, which would place KLCI levels at 1, 463, where the market may bottom, ' it cautioned. On Thursday, the KLCI neared the crucial 1, 500 level before some buying helped it close off the intra-day's low.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"With so many famous Entrepreneurs who started from scratch, a lot of people would also plan to start up their own business. One of the basic step required to achieve this goal is to get hold of a domain or multiple domain names. Unfortunately, not everyone is able to reach the success they had in mind and may end up giving up on their idea. As a result the domain they were about to use would go unused.To assist those who wants to sell their domain, one of the renowned web hosting firm, GoDaddy has started to provide a new service through which old domains could be sold easily. The service has been named as List for Sale. As a result to this, the GoDaddy users can take help from the company by listing their domain there so it can be sold afterwards. The whole procedure works just like how Brokers work. Listing the domain is free of cost and if it ends up getting sold then a small amount will be deducted as a commission for the company. The whole process has been kept simple and user friendly. Listing the domain name is only a three step process and starts with the domain holder opening the List for Sale through the control panel. Next step is setting up a price tag for the domain. This step is also assisted by the company through providing an estimated worth as well for the listed domain. Then the domain is added on the marketplace with the help of a landing page which will be the final step and will let others know that the domain is available to be purchased.The service was announced back in January and shortly a beta version rolled out. Since then the service has helped many domain owners to sale it and have contributed a lot to bring in revenue. The service can be availed easily by the users and could also play a small role in making some money for next business plan.

      "      \"summary\": \"By Gabriel CrossleyBEIJING \\u2013 In Heyuejia, a care home in western Beijing, new residents announced their advanced ages and illustrious former careers to applause from a crowded hall, before tucking into a candle-decorated cake and dancing.Spacious rooms, nutritious food, and activities from calligraphy to art therapy are on offer to residents \\u2013 largely retired professionals \\u2013 for around 10,000 yuan ($1,541.54) a month. Prices scale with the level of care needed.Such facilities play a key role in other aging countries such as Japan. But experts say China's relative lack of wealth and a dearth of qualified carers has hamstrung the sector, keeping the burden of care on families.China had 264 million citizens aged 60 and older in 2020, a number set to increase rapidly just as the working population shrinks.HNA Investment Group opened Heyuejia in 2016 as part of efforts to 'respond to China's aging crisis,' according to a company statement.Helped by government subsidies, more than 40,000 registered homes have been built in recent decades. But many are too expensive or too low quality to replace family care, experts say.Some facilities have long waiting lists. But most are quite empty \\u2013 average occupancy rates are as low as 50%, official data suggests, far lower than the 80%-90% rates seen in Japan or the UK.Wang Yiguang, 85, a retired scientist who moved into Heyuejia in 2018, likes the care home and can comfortably afford it.'Here you have someone to help you at any time, and there's a doctor to see if you need to go to the hospital,' Wang said.One of her sons, living in the U.S., had resisted the move. He had seen Americans in care homes who seemed sluggish and irritable.But her son came around when he saw how happy his parents were, said Wang, who sings in a Russian-language choir with other residents who studied in the Soviet Union. NOTENOUGHCAREGIVERSBei Wu, a professor at New York University who has researched aging in China since the 1980s, said high fees and poor staffing push away potential residents. China planned a decade ago to train 6 million caregivers by 2020. Just 300,000 were qualified by 2017, according to a report cited by state news agency Xinhua. The latest calls for 2 million to be trained by 2022.Until recently almost all the elderly were looked after by family members, Wu said. But shrinking families, migration, and a decline in a sense of filial duty has led to the 'erosion of the family support system,' she said.Without more frontline staff and expanded community-based care, the pressures on families will mount, she said.Yang Wei, an engineer from northern Hebei province, said that his grandfather, who is nearly 90, had wanted to try out a care home to reduce the stress on his family after a bad fall.He moved into one that cost 4,000 yuan a month. But staff didn't seem to care about residents' well being, Yang said.'The staff weren't professional. And there weren't enough,' Yang said. 'Even if you spend more money\\u2026 it is still difficult for the elderly to enjoy good care in nursing homes, and families can't be completely at ease. So we took Grandpa home.'COSTLYCARENie Guihua, 72, has been looking after her husband, Yang Shulin, for nearly two decades,He had a stroke at 55, can no longer speak, and uses a wheelchair. Nie also helps care for her two grandchildren.Nie and her husband each get 800 yuan a month from the state \\u2013 about two-thirds the cost of a care home near where they live in a village outside Beijing.Her son, Yang Xiaoli, who is divorced, drives buses for a living, and often only gets home late at night. Nie, a former farmer, was fined for having her son under the one-child policy, a key contributor to China's rapidly aging population that was relaxed in 2016.Yang said even if they could afford such care, other pressures would make it impossible.'If my mum and my dad were in a care home, who would look after the kids?' he said.\",\n",

Other folks know everything they do on a piece of land has an influence on the land, water and air everywhere on earth. Sometimes the influence is subtle, other times profound. Sometimes the influence is only detected after generations.Native American Nations in Wisconsin have led conservation efforts for decades. In the past couple of decades some of their projects have been completed using resources from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. To coordinate between Tribal Governments and parts of the U.S.-governmental departments and programs within the USDA, the Wisconsin Tribal Conservation Advisory Council was formed in 2001.'We were the first tribal advisory council in the United States,' said Jeff Mears, executive director of the council. 'Initially the mission was to work with tribes on natural-resource issues. We now also provide services in the agricultural area.'There is such a nexus between the environment and agriculture. You can't have healthy agriculture without a healthy environment. You can't have a healthy environment without best practices in agriculture. Tribes have a long history of agriculture, but some haven't practiced it for a long time. We are seeing a resurgence of tribes being interested in agriculture. (The council) has been able to connect the tribes to technical resources, training (and) networking.'The pandemic has spurred more interest in community gardens, personal gardens and agricultural issues. At the recent food-sovereignty conferences in Onieda (Wisconsin) one of the signs said, \\u2018You can't be a sovereign nation if you can't feed yourself.' Having local food addresses so many issues \\u2013 homeland security, food safety, transportation. Tribes are on the forefront of climate-change issues. We are bringing back traditional cultural practices that address these problems and (the council) plays a role.'Jerry Thompson coordinates outreach and education for the council.'(The council) has worked on many projects through the years,' Thompson said. 'Traditionally many tribes used raised beds to grow food. At Bad River they practiced that type of agriculture. Around 15 years ago (the council) worked with (the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service) to come up with a design for raised beds so people could take a traditional practice, modernize it and use it. Now you can buy raised beds in grocery stores.'We took traditional ecological knowledge, modernized it, standardized it and applied it to projects with the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Other (traditional ecological knowledge) we have applied are tree drops \\u2013 trees cut and dropped into lakes to create habitat for fish. Tree drops are now a (Natural Resources Conservation Service) conservation practice. (The Natural Resources Conservation Service) was not involved in aquaculture projects until (the council) determined the need. We developed the resource concerns with the Tribal Nations; we developed the technical standards and we completed pilot-project work. (The council) has done a lot of work in pioneering conservation practices with the Natural Resources Conservation Service to meet tribal needs.Mears said, '(The council) can fill gaps in expertise for tribes. It is really a benefit for the tribes, all working together to come up with conservation practices. On the USDA side it is a trust responsibility to work with tribes and we help them do that.'Jim Thannum is the planning director and natural-resources-development specialist for the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission in Odanah, Wisconsin. He's the commission's liaison to the Wisconsin Tribal Conservation Advisory Council.'I was thinking about how this all started,' he said. 'Decades ago Pat Levenworth, the state conservationist, reached out to the tribes and invited (the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission) to participate in a technical committee when (the Natural Resources Conservation Service) in this state was just starting to formulate a relationship with the tribes. The idea was to find out what programs (the service) had to offer and to help (service) staff learn about Tribal Sovereignty and needs of the tribes. It was a process of education.'The committee met on reservations so members could see what the tribes were doing. (The service) gained a perspective on what the tribes were doing in northern Wisconsin. Tribal leaders worked to educate agency staff on issues important to the tribes as well as cultural sensitivity. The meetings allowed people to find common ground and common concerns, like the environment.'That led to Natural Resources Conservation Service involvement in new projects in new aspects of agriculture and conservation, like aquaculture.Gary Haughn is the District Conservationist at the Natural Resources Conservation Service in Ashland, Wisconsin. He has worked with the council for more than 20 years.'(The Wisconsin Tribal Conservation Advisory Council) is a government-to-government relationship with the USDA and Tribal governments to service resource needs,' he said. 'All USDA agencies are involved. (The Natural Resources Conservation Service) was the one in the 1995 farm bill that picked up the lead for USDA. The idea was to work cooperatively with the Tribes to service their needs. In Wisconsin (the council) was formed to do that. District conservationists servicing different areas where tribes were located act as tribal liaisons. We connect with natural-resources departments in the different tribal communities to see if we can service their needs with our program options and technical expertise. We meet cooperatively with tribal staff and work on conservation projects. Other USDA agencies use programs they have to help underserved areas.'We have worked with Red Cliff on many projects. We helped get a handicapped-accessible stairway down to a beach, trail work and technical assistance at Frog Bay (Tribal National Park). We assisted the fish hatchery with walleye ponds. We helped reline older ponds, and helped put in new walleye ponds and a wetland effluent-flow-through system. We assisted with erosion control on the banks of Spirit Island.'At Bad River we have helped with lakeshore protection, access trails to beaches, habitat restoration (and) erosion stabilization. We helped expand walleye ponds along U.S. Highway 2. We assisted with invasive-species control in the Kakagan Sloughs, wild-rice management and purple loosestrife control. We assisted the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission with invasive-species-control programs. That is just (Natural Resources Conservation Service) involvement. Other USDA agencies have participated in many other projects.'Other projects include grazing plans for buffalo, fish-hatchery ponds for other tribes, access roads and wild-rice-management projects.'A few years ago (the Natural Resources Conservation Service) teamed up with the state of Wisconsin to assist tribes with assistance with walleye ponds,' Haughn said. 'Wisconsin Tribes restock walleye in Wisconsin lakes where walleye are taken every year under existing treaties. Lakes where walleye are speared in spring are restocked by the tribes. A lot of people don't know that.'To be continued ...Visit www.wtcac.org and glifwc.org for more information.Jason Maloney is an 'elderly' farm boy from Marinette County, Wisconsin.

      "      \"summary\": \"'Product of USA' should mean USA \\nOPINION\\u00a0\\u00a0As we headed into the holiday weekend many families were firing up the grill and celebrating with burgers and steaks cooked to sizzling perfection. Or in sadder cases, charred to an unrecognizable blackened blob. Whether one of the lucky folks feasting on a grillmaster's handiwork or instead chomping on charred protein, will you know where the beef on your plate originated?After seeing store shelves stripped bare during the COVID-19 lockdown, many consumers have become more conscious of the fragility in the U.S. food supply. Interest in buying locally surged, which is why many customers reach for beef with the label 'Product of the USA' in the cooler. And many, understandably, will think that in doing so they're supporting U.S. farmers and buying beef from cattle that are born and raised in the USA.Unfortunately that's where the disconnect lies. Sometimes that meat is actually from animals that never took a breath in America. Currently meat can have a 'Product of the USA' label slapped on even if it was imported and only repackaged at a USDA-inspected facility.I think that's bologna. Thankfully, so does the National Farmers Union (NFU), and they've raised concerns about it, alongside ranchers and farm organizations from throughout the country.Those efforts may be paying off. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced July 1 it would conduct a 'top-to-bottom review' of the 'Product of the USA' label. That's good news for farmers and ranchers who know how the label tricks customers into thinking beef and pork is truly an American product \\u2013 even in cases where it was born, raised and slaughtered in another country.That isn't just a problem for consumers. It hurts farmers who can't differentiate their product while trying to survive against the competing powers of multinational corporations. My family raises beef cattle in northwestern Wisconsin. We have marketed cattle through conventional channels, but are shifting to direct-marketing to family, friends and neighbors. The switch was spurred partly by our frustration at deceptive labeling \\u2013 and how, when marketed through traditional avenues, the beef from our animals \\u2013 born and raised here in Wisconsin \\u2013 has no edge in the marketplace as compared to imports that are pouring into our country from places like Brazil, Mexico and Canada.The fact that our government allows the stamp of 'Product of the USA' on meat from an animal that never set a hoof on American soil should give us all pause. That loophole is slowly and painfully pushing American farmers out of business.During the past few decades the United States has experienced a concerning level of consolidation in agriculture. Four major meatpacking companies \\u2013 Cargill, Tyson, JBS and National Beef \\u2013 now control more than 85 percent of the American beef market. In turn, farmers have incredibly little control concerning the slim margin they receive. For example that top-sirloin steak that averages $9.99 a pound? According to National Farmers Union tracking of USDA data, the farmer's share is $1.90. Misleading labels exacerbate these already difficult market conditions.Still farmers are out here rolling the dice. Many of us play the game because we feel a strong tie to the land and a desire to protect it for future generations. And we believe that in a world where something as clear-cut as 'Product of the USA' is being watered down, it's important for there to be family farmers \\u2013 and organizations like the Farmers Union \\u2013 safeguarding our supply chain and providing an alternative to this sad status quo that has become the American food system.As National Farmers Union President Rob Larew said, 'American consumers deserve to know where their meat comes from. Whether they want to keep their food dollar in their community, limit their food miles, or avoid unsustainable or unethical practices, there are many reasons why someone would want to know what country their meat was raised in. But as things stand, there's no way to determine the origin of beef and pork since the wildly deceptive \\u2018Product of the USA' label can appear on meat that spent its entire life in another country.'Farmers Union, along with the U.S. Cattlemen's Association, was a vocal advocate of Country-of-Origin Labeling for meat, but the World Trade Organization deemed the labeling discriminatory against Mexican and Canadian cattle \\u2013 and the U.S. Congress repealed the law. Yet we do label country-of-origin for many other products like lamb, fruits and vegetables, and clothing. Why should beef and pork be different \\u2013 other than the lobbying power of those oligopolies? It seems that the rights of other countries have become more important than the right of Americans to know the origins of their food.Please educate yourself and join in the efforts to remedy this deeply flawed labeling loophole. It's purely common sense that the 'Product of the USA' label be reserved only for meat products derived exclusively from animals born, raised, slaughtered and processed in the United States. You know, for products actually 'of the USA.'Danielle Endvick is a former dairy farmer's daughter from Holcombe, Wisconsin. She currently raises beef in her corner of Chippewa County, Wisconsin.

      "      \"summary\": \"IN THE MIDDLE of March last year, as the coronavirus pandemic was taking hold, a private-equity boss in America was asked how his industry would deal with the shock. The businesses owned by buyout firms would first look to raise debt wherever and however they could. Drawing equity from private-equity investors would be a last resort. 'I think you'll see the same in public markets\\u2014a lot of convertible issues,' he said. Sure enough, there was soon a rash of big convertible-bond sales by cruise lines, airlines and retailers.A convertible is a bond with an option to swap for shares of common equity. Last year $159bn-worth were issued worldwide, according to figures compiled by Calamos Investments, an asset manager. This was around twice the value of convertibles issued in 2019. So far this year around $100bn-worth have been issued. An asset class that had fallen out of fashion is back in vogue. That is because convertibles are well-suited to fast-changing conditions.To understand why, start with some basics. A convertible bond has the usual features of a garden-variety bond: a principal to be repaid on maturity, an interest-rate coupon paid once or twice a year and so on. In addition the issuer grants the bondholder the right to convert the principal into a fixed number of shares. This number, known as the conversion rate, is typically set so that it would be worthwhile to exercise the option only if the share price rose by 30-40%. The option is thus 'out of the money' when the convertible is issued. A company with a share price of, say, $15 might set the conversion rate of a $1,000 bond at 50. At that rate it would begin to make economic sense to swap the bond for equity only if the share price reached $20 (ie, $1,000 divided by 50). In exchange for the equity option, convertibles pay a lower rate of interest. A rule of thumb is that they have a coupon roughly half that of a regular bond.Convertibles may be complex securities, but in some circumstances they have clear advantages over straight debt or equity for both issuers and investors. This is the case for unproven firms in capital-hungry businesses. (Until recently Tesla was a big issuer of convertibles, for instance.) The founders of such firms are often reluctant to issue equity, because it dilutes their ownership. They would prefer to issue debt. But bond investors might demand a steep interest rate to compensate for the risk of default. Convertible bonds can be an ideal compromise. Investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate in exchange for a piece of the equity upside. For business owners, convertibles are less dilutive than straight equity. New shares are issued later at a much higher price, if at all.Around 60% of the volume of issues so far this year is by firms that have been listed for less than three years, says Joseph Wysocki of Calamos. But old-economy cyclical firms are issuers, too. Some, like Carnival Cruises and Southwest Airlines, used convertibles last year to raise 'rescue' finance at lower interest rates and without immediate dilution. Others are using them to finance investment: Ford Motor sold $2bn of convertible bonds in March, for instance.This flurry of issuance is quite a shift. The market for convertibles was previously rather moribund, even as high-yield bonds and leveraged loans enjoyed a boom. The absence of meaningful inflation meant that long-term interest rates steadily fell. Bond investors enjoyed healthy capital gains. At an aggregate level, the trend in American corporate finance was to swap equity for debt, and not the other way round.Today's challenges are different. A big concern is that inflation and interest rates are at the start of an upward trend. A world of high inflation would be a trickier one in which to raise capital by issuing corporate bonds. The nominal value of the bond at redemption would be a lot lower in real terms. By contrast, convertible bonds offer some protection. They are 'nominal assets which come with an embedded call option on a real asset', writes Dylan Grice of Calderwood Capital, an alternative-investment boutique. The option to convert to equity affords the bondholder a degree of indexation to rising consumer prices.Convertibles have already proved their worth. They were almost tailor-made for the circumstances of spring 2020. Big changes call for flexible forms of capital. And it is easy to imagine further economic dislocations on the horizon. Convertibles are the asset class for the times.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Classic convertible\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"THE GLOBAL financial crisis of 2007-09 was socially divisive as well as economically destructive. It inspired a resentful backlash, exemplified by America's Tea Party. That crisis at least had the tact to spread financial pain across the rich as well as the poor, however. The share of global wealth held by the top 'one percent' actually fell in 2008. The pandemic has been different. Amid all the misery and mortality, the number of millionaires rose last year by 5.2m to over 56m, according to the Global Wealth Report published by Credit Suisse, a bank. The one percent increased their share of wealth to 45%, a percentage point higher than in 2019.The wealthy largely have central banks to thank for their good fortune last year. By slashing interest rates and amassing assets, central banks helped the price of shares, property and bonds rebound. Their economic-rescue effort was, in many ways, a triumph. Yet central banks are not entirely at ease with the role they have played in comforting the comfortable. In October Mary Daly of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco contrasted America's full financial rebound with its incomplete economic recovery. 'It seems unfair,' she acknowledged. 'Another example of Wall Street winning and Main Street losing.' Her speech fits a trend; central bankers are mentioning inequality more often (see chart). The latest annual economic report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the central banks' bank, devotes a whole chapter to the distributional effects of monetary policy.In the past central banks would argue that inequality was primarily the result of structural forces (automation, say, or globalisation) that lie beyond their mandate or their power. They have only one policy instrument, they would point out. They cannot set different benchmark interest rates for rich and for poor. And their workhorse economic models often featured a single 'representative' household that was meant to stand in for everyone. A model will struggle to assess a policy's impact on the distribution of income if there is, in effect, only one household to distribute to.In keeping with this tradition, the BIS warns its members not to overreach. Central banks best serve the cause of combating inequality by sticking to their traditional goals of curbing inflation, downturns and financial excess. Tacking on inequality as another objective could compromise the achievement of these aims. Monetary policy will find it harder to fight cyclical forces if it is too busy flailing against structural forces such as technology and trade.Moreover, the age-old fight against inflation, recession and speculation is not necessarily inegalitarian. High inflation is often a regressive tax, harming those who rely on cash the most. '[I have] seen first-hand the havoc that high inflation can wreak on the poorer segments of society when I grew up in Argentina,' said Claudio Borio of the BIS in a recent speech. Fighting downturns is also an egalitarian endeavour. Recessions worsen inequality and inequality worsens recessions, in a cycle of 'perverse amplification', as Mr Borio puts it. Deeply divided societies suffer larger drops in output in bad times and respond more slowly to monetary easing. The effect of policy on the economy is impaired partly because the very poor cannot access credit, and therefore cannot borrow (and spend) more when interest rates are cut. Meanwhile, the very rich do not spend much more either, even though looser policy pushes up the prices of their assets.There is, then, no need to give central banks a new, more egalitarian set of goals. But that leaves open the question of how central banks should meet those goals. Some approaches and tools may be better for social cohesion than others. And central banks might reasonably favour those that, all else equal, serve their mandate more equitably than others.The Fed, for example, last year adopted a less trigger-happy interpretation of its inflation target. A side-effect of this approach should be lower income inequality. It will allow the Fed to find out whether people on the economic sidelines can become employable if hiring remains strong enough for long enough. To guide their thinking, central banks are turning to economic models that include 'heterogeneous' households, a step beyond the 'representative-agent New Keynesian' model (otherwise known as RANK). They also now have a bewildering variety of tools to choose from. Some buy equities, which are largely held by the rich. Others provide cheap funding to banks that lend to small firms. (The Bank of Japan does both.) Each tool will make a different contribution both to the level of spending and the distribution of income.A tool of the manyYet there are limits to what monetary policy alone can achieve. Even a central bank that sticks to its customary role, the BIS notes, may face awkward trade-offs, pitting income inequality against wealth inequality and inequality now versus inequality later. Bold monetary easing may lead to a more uniform distribution of income by preserving jobs. But it will boost the price of assets, increasing wealth inequality, at least in the short run. In addition, these expansive monetary policies can, the BIS argues, contribute to financial excesses that could go on to result in a deeper, more protracted recession in the future. And that would ultimately be bad even for income equality.The BIS's answer is to bring a wider range of policies to bear, including better financial regulation to curb speculative excesses and more responsive fiscal policy, where public finances permit. By spending more, governments allow central banks to buy less. Ben Bernanke, a former Fed chair much maligned by populist critics, put it this way: 'If fiscal policymakers took more of the responsibility for promoting economic recovery and job creation, mon etary policy could be less aggressive.'If central banks have worsened inequality in their efforts to rescue the economy it is partly because they have borne an unequal share of the job. With more help from fiscal policy, central banks will find it easier to take away the punch bowl before the tea party gets going. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Stabilit\\u00e9, lib\\u00e9ralit\\u00e9, \\u00e9galit\\u00e9\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Yeti YETI stock has skyrocketed since it went public in 2018, including a 115% jump in the last year. The growing high-end cooler company's expansion into other areas has attracted more customers and more Wall Street praise.\\nFar from Cooling Down \\nYeti started out as a high-end cooler maker about 15 years ago. Its heavy-duty offerings can cost up to $1,300 and they have become a mainstay on commercial fishing boats and other outdoor-activities that demand ice, given their rugged nature and ability to keep ice cold for days. But there is only so big a cooler firm catering to niche consumers can grow.\\nYeti still sells those massive white coolers. More importantly, it sells a seemingly ever-expanding array of coolers in various styles, sizes, colors, and more. And its strong branding efforts have helped it turn into a billion-dollar business.\\nAlong with coolers, Yeti sells gear-boxes, outdoor chairs, dog bowls, and much more. In fact, some of its most popular items are tumblers and mugs, with drinkware accounting for nearly 60% of total FY20 revenue.\\nYeti is now a staple everywhere from car cupholders and office desks to cookouts, campsites, and beyond. And the company is currently focused on rolling out more luggage, backpacks, and duffels as it continually expands its reach.\\nYeti's 2020 sales jumped 19.5% to $1.1 billion, with its direct-to-consumer revenue up 50% to account for nearly half of its sales. The company's DTC growth outside of its wholesale business to stores such as Dick's Sporting Goods DKS, and other outdoor-focused retailers has helped improve its margins.\\nAlong with e-commerce, Yeti has slowly built its brick-and-mortar business beyond its flagship store in Austin, Texas. The company currently has stores in Denver, Charleston, Chicago, and a few other strategic locations. All of these offerings are supported by its rather impressive brand building that's inspired countless knockoffs. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Other Fundamentals \\nYeti crushed our Q1 estimates, with sales up a whopping 42% and its adjusted earnings 245% higher. Looking ahead, Zacks estimates call for its full-year 2021 sales so jump another 22.5% and then pop 14% higher in FY22. These estimates would come on top of 17% top-line growth in FY19 and 19.5% last year.\\nMeanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to climb by 26% this year and another 17% in 2022. Yeti has also has topped our bottom-line estimates by an average of 82% in the trailing four periods.\\nYeti is part of the Leisure and Recreation Products industry that's in the top 7% of our over 250 Zacks industries. It is poised to benefit from continued spending and pent-up demand, especially amid higher-income households that can afford $40 mugs and $300 coolers.\\nYeti is also part of a group of newer, higher-end brands thriving in the Amazon AMZN age that includes the likes of Lululemon LULU, Peloton PTON, Canada Goose GOOS, and others. 'The momentum carried over from 2020 and on display to start 2021 showcases the passion for the brand and the relevance of our product portfolio as consumers continue to participate in the significant growth in active, outdoor lifestyles,' CEO Matt Reintjes said in prepared Q1 remarks.\\nAs we mentioned up top, Yeti has surged 115% in the last year, which is part of a roughly 430% climb since its public debut. The stock had cooled off a bit earlier in the year. But it's up 15% in the past three months to outclimb its industry and the market.\\nYeti closed regular hours Thursday 5% below its early June record at around $90 a share. Despite its run and the broader market looking due for a bit of a pullback, Yeti sits below neutral RSI levels. The stock is also trading 15% below its year-long highs in terms of forward earnings.\\nBottom Line\\nYeti's positive EPS revisions help it capture a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment, alongside its 'B' grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Plus, eight of the 14 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are 'Strong Buys,' with nothing below a 'Hold.' Therefore, investors with long-term outlooks might want to consider Yeti.\\n5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020. Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth.Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.Today, See These 5 Potential Home Runs >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AlzChem Group AG closes one of the last white spots\\u00a0in the global market for Perlka(R) fertilizer with Canada Trostberg, July 9, 2021 - AlzChem Group AG is now taking a further important step towards developing as many of the world's important fertilizer markets as possible. Having already successfully entered the Brazilian market in the first quarter, the company is now moving into the Canadian market. Andreas Niedermaier, CEO of AlzChem Group AG: \\\"Our strategy is to be represented in all globally relevant fertilizer markets with Perlka(R) and to continue the success story that has already lasted 113 years. The characteristics of Perlka(R) are more topical and relevant today than ever before, as the global trend towards ever faster crop rotations in agriculture plays into the hands of our calcium cyanamide-based fertilizer. Canada is a particularly interesting market for us because Perlka(R) will be used primarily in vegetable, canola and potato production.\\\" In many regions of Canada, potatoes are grown for direct consumption and for further processing. The high lime level of Perlka(R) ensures optimum loosening of the soil. Perlka(R) calcium cyanamide can continue its international success story primarily because it is a specialty among fertilizers: Not only does it supply the soil with stable nitrogen and lime, but it also remains in the stable ammonium form in the soil for six to eight weeks longer than many other fertilizers. For this reason, many farmers rely on Perlka(R) to avoid imminent losses in terms of yield and quality in view of shorter crop rotations. With its innovative further development, AlzChem has also succeeded in establishing itself also in new international markets as an important player in the fields of agriculture and health. In Canada, Perlka(R) meets the requirements of the new fertilizer regulations, so that its use there is assured in the long term. The great market potential is reflected, among other things, in the research interest shown by universities. The University of Alberta, for example, is conducting a research project on the application of Perlka(R) in canola. This shows that the positive effects of Perlka(R) on healthy soil and healthy plants can also be seen in an area-rich crop such as canola.

      "      \"summary\": \"By Nandita Bose and Michelle Price \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Reuters/EVELYN HOCKSTEIN FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on his proposed \\\"American Families Plan\\\" legislation at McHenry County College during a visit to the northwest Chicago suburb Crystal Lake, Illinois, U.S., July 7, 2021.\\n\\n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's planned executive order to promote greater U.S. competition will target bank mergers by pushing the Federal Reserve and the Department of Justice to update merger guidelines and increase scrutiny of deals, according to a source familiar with the matter. \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Reuters/Molly Riley FILE PHOTO: A BB&T bank is pictured in Alexandria, Virginia\\n\\n It will also ask the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to issue rules giving consumers full control of their financial data to make it easier for customers to switch banks, the source said. The planned order, which is expected to be signed by Biden on Friday, is likely to chill M&A in the banking sector after a rash of deals unleashed by the Trump administration's more industry-friendly regulatory policy. Those included the $28 billion marriage of BB&T Corp and SunTrust, the biggest bank tie-up since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and Fifth Third Bancorp's $4.7 billion purchase of MB Financial Inc, and many smaller deals. The value of M&A among commercial, savings and investment banks reached $54.66 billion by November 2020, the highest since 2009, according to data from Dealogic. \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Reuters/Joe Skipper FILE PHOTO: A branch location of Fifth Third Bank is shown in Boca Raton\\n\\n While such transactions have been subject to federal review, government agencies have not formally denied a bank merger application in more than 15 years, according to a paper by Jeremy Kress, a University of Michigan professor who previously worked on bank merger oversight at the Fed. \\n Load Error \\\"There has been a rash of bank closures across the United States, and we're dealing with the bad effects for a lot of people and it's also hard to switch options ... so it is, in a sense, a crisis of competition,\\\" said the source. A report by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows that the number of commercial banks in the U.S. has fallen by about 10,000 over the past two decades, a decline of 70%. This has led to higher fees for consumers, reduced access to banking services for communities of color and low-income working families, and increased concerns about risk to the financial system, according to studies by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. Bank mergers have been a target of progressives including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who says consolidation harms consumers. The executive order, which would also address merger guidelines of two other federal agencies that oversee banks, could drag big banks into a high-stakes antitrust debate even as they warn they need help from Washington to compete with financial technology upstarts. The Bank Policy Institute, which represents the nation's biggest lenders, argued in 2020 that banks face a barrage of competition from such players. Reuters first reported Biden's plan to issue a competition executive order. Details have since emerged on specific actions the administration plans to take that will impact industries such as farm equipment manufacturers, rail and sea shipping, and the labor market. The actions are part of Biden's moves to strengthen competition by not just enforcing antitrust laws but using federal power to ignite competition in an array of businesses. Since taking office, he has appointed advocates of tougher antitrust enforcement to top roles at the White House and agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission. Former President Barack Obama's administration issued a similar order in 2016, but it failed to yield results. The Biden order includes details on how government agencies should review deals and competition in industries, the source said. Biden's order also pushes to allow customers to switch banks by taking their financial transaction history data with them. In October, the CFPB sought comment on a potential proposal to increase consumers' access to their own financial data, which is collected by a growing number of financial institutions and apps. The agency's new leadership has yet to move ahead with it. The source said the White House hopes the executive order would spur the agency to push ahead with the changes. The increased ability to share such data could also help drive more accurate credit scoring models, helping to boost access to credit for under-served and minority communities, the source added.

The administration is now in talks with Russia and China to urgently secure more shots, officials said.Singapore Seeks \\u2018Middle Path' on Reopening (10:15 a.m. HK)Singapore will not take the same approach as the U.K. and U.S. for mass reopening, but neither will it keep the sort of restrictive outlook that China and Australia have adopted, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said.Instead, Singapore will pursue a 'middle path,' Ong said in an interview with Bloomberg Television's Haslinda Amin, where mitigation measures will be maintained while the country opens up progressively.Tokyo Prepares for Fan-Free Olympics (10:10 a.m. HK)The Tokyo Olympics will ban spectators from events held in Japan's capital, revising an earlier decision to allow some fans, as the resurgence of virus cases pushed the government to declare a state of emergency in the city.The decision, announced by Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa, comes after Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared a fourth state of emergency for Tokyo, running from July 12 through Aug. 22.Why the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Will Be Like No Other: QuickTakeThailand's Infections Near Record High as Lockdown Mulled (10 a.m. HK)Thailand reported its second highest single-day increase in Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began, with the nation's coronavirus task force scheduled to consider more stringent measures to contain an outbreak driven by the more contagious delta variant.The Southeast Asian nation on Friday recorded 9,276 new infections, the most since May 17 and about 40% higher than the daily average this week, according to the Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration.

The latest surge is a setback for a country that has been lauded as a model for containing the outbreak without imposing a lockdown.Very Few Kids Need to Shield From Covid (7:01 a.m. HK)Most young people face an 'extremely low' risk of illness and death from Covid-19 and have no need to shield from the virus, according to researchers behind a large U.K. study.The analysis, which its authors say is the most comprehensive on the topic to date, backs up clinical reports that show children and teens are less likely to be hospitalized or face severe effects from the virus. Covid-19 does increase the chance of serious illness in the most vulnerable children -- those with complex disabilities and severe existing medical conditions -- but even in those cases the risks are smaller compared with adults.Mexico Cases Post Highest Rise Since Feb. 13 (6:30 a.m. HK)Mexico Covid-19 cases rose by 9,452 to reach almost 2.6 million, the biggest daily increase in almost five months, according to government data.

Deaths rose 266 to reach 234,458.Canada Won't Allow Unvaccinated Tourists Yet (5:45 a.m. HK)Canada will hold off allowing unvaccinated tourists to enter the country for 'quite a while' because the government isn't willing to jeopardize the progress the country made to contain the outbreak, CNBC reported, citing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.'I can tell you right now that's not going to happen for quite a while,' Trudeau told reporters when he was asked when Canada would allow open its borders to these tourists.Canada just waived quarantine requirements for fully-vaccinated citizens. Further announcements are expected in coming weeks, the prime minister added. Trudeau has previously said the government is looking closely at vaccination rates, the spread of variants and how the pandemic is handed globally.White House Defends Door-to-Door Vaccine Push (4:18 p.m. NY)The White House defended a push to support groups with door-to-door efforts to encourage vaccinations -- a day after Missouri Governor Mike Parson said it would 'not be an effective or a welcome strategy.'Missouri has the U.S.'s highest percentage of cases caused by the delta variant, and vaccinations lag behind the national average. A team was dispatched earlier this week to southwestern Missouri, where the outbreak is straining medical capacity.Portugal Expands Curfew (1:13 p.m. NY)Portugal said a nighttime curfew will apply to more municipalities as the government tries to contain an increase in infections.The limit to movement in public spaces between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. in regions including Lisbon will now be imposed in 60 municipalities, up from 45 municipalities previously, Presidency Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva said. Existing limits on weekend opening hours of restaurants and non-food stores will also apply to more municipalities, and remote working remains mandatory in those locations.U.S. Keeps Foreign Travel Curbs (9:36 a.m. NY)The U.S. isn't yet ready to lift restrictions on incoming international travel and ultimately the decision will be based on data, not arbitrary dates, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in an interview with Bloomberg.He added that the U.S. has working groups with the U.K., the European Union, Canada and Mexico to determine when it will be appropriate to lift the bans.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P. \\nContinue Reading \\nShow full articles without \\\"Continue Reading\\\" button for {0} hours.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"'Global investors have had little love for Europe in the past decade,' says Nicholas Jasinski in Barron's. 'Anaemic' growth and political instability 'have kept a lid on European stocks'. Yet with reopening gathering pace, 'the near-term case for relative outperformance by Europe now is the strongest in years'. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index ended the first half of the year last week with a 13.5% gain. \\u00a0Last week the EU launched its vaccine passport, providing a shot in the arm for the tourism industry ahead of the summer season. Brussels and London are working on mutual recognition of the NHS Covid Pass. More than half of the EU's population has now received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, with countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Spain currently outstripping the US on this measure.\\u00a0European data has surprised on the upside recently, says a Morgan Stanley note. The European Commission's economic sentiment indicator is at a 21-year high. The US has now passed through the fastest phase of its recovery and there is nervousness about the outlook for monetary policy, says Jasinski. By contrast, Europe's recovery is only just starting. Indeed, it is 'one of the few developed regions' tipped to 'see better GDP gains in 2022 than in 2021'. On 16.5 times 2022 earnings the Stoxx 600 is also a welcome remedy for US 'valuation vertigo'.\\u00a0Most investment banks are tipping European markets to outperform the US for 'the remainder of the year and into 2022', says Elliot Smith for CNBC. US fund flows into European stocks so far this year have been the strongest in six years. BNP Paribas's strategists think easy monetary policy and a broad-based recovery will benefit Europe's numerous value stocks: the banks, carmakers and energy companies that have been left behind as US tech has soared over the past decade. European shares look well-placed to benefit from the next stage of the recovery, agrees David Brenchley in The Times. Sectors 'such as payments, medical technology and green energy' also look promising.\\u00a0The bull case for Europe extends beyond reopening, says Graham Secker in the Financial Times. Europe's post-pandemic recovery fund, which has seen member states issue joint bonds for the first time, is a 'game-changer'. The fund's slow rollout has drawn unfavourable comparisons with the much bigger US fiscal stimulus. But while America has created a short-term consumption surge, the European plan is 'more focused on longer-term investment' in areas such as digitalisation and provides extra help to weaker peripheral economies. The five-year time horizon should also mean it provides a more consistent tailwind for European equities in the coming years.\\nTwo investment trusts that have proved their worthInvestment trustsTwo investment trusts that have proved their worthThese two investment trusts have earned investors' confidence since their flotations and remain solid bets, says Max King.25 Jun 2021\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Global stocks have enjoyed their second-strongest start to a year since 1998, says Cormac Mullen on Bloomberg. The MSCI All Countries World index rose by 11% during the first six months of the year, second only to a 15% gain in the first half of 2019. 'The global stock benchmark closed at a record on 28 June, and has risen almost 90% since its pandemic low in March 2020.'America's benchmark S&P 500 index enjoyed yet another strong half, gaining 14.4%, while the FTSE 100 rose by 10.9%. The rally in value stocks was not enough for the FTSE to outperform the US index, but the FTSE Small Cap index, which tracks smaller listed companies, has been a happier hunting ground, as Laith Khalaf of AJ Bell points out.\\u00a0The index has 'repeatedly set new record highs' and has gained 19.4% so far this year. Smaller businesses are more exposed to the re-opening domestic economy than the big blue-chips.\\u00a0Asian stocks had a more muted first half. Japan's Topix gained 8.3% but a weaker yen eroded those returns for British investors. China's CSI 300 index was virtually flat.\\u00a0There were some Asian bright spots, says Eustance Huang on CNBC. Vietnam's VN index surged by an impressive 27.6% in the first half. Taiwan's Taiex (up 20.5%), South Korea's Kospi (14.7%) and India's Nifty 50 (12.4%) also turned in solid performances.\\u00a0Markets have been unusually placid during the last six months, says Dominic Coyle in The Irish Times. So far, the S&P 500's 'biggest peak-to-trough pullback in 2021 was a mere 4.2%'. That might not last. Still, data from LPL Research shows that a 'strong first half of the year is usually followed by a strong second half... What goes up' will not necessarily 'come down'.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Poor Liontrust. You'd think you could sell pretty much anything these days if you labelled it 'green', 'responsible,' 'sustainable', or anything else ESG-related ('environmental, social and governance', if you didn't know already). But last week the fund manager had to scrap the launch of its first investment trust \\u2013 the ESG Trust.You can blame the difficulty of raising money from UK investors (a few other trusts have failed to launch recently). It may also have been lack of ambition: the trust was looking to raise just \\u00a3100m \\u2013 not enough to make it investible for wealth managers.But these explanations don't hold enough water. UK investors, notes Numis Securities, invested a net \\u00a33.5bn in markets in May. The AIC (which represents investment companies) notes that overall, fund raisings in the sector have been hitting record after record.\\u00a0What, then, is the problem? Perhaps, as Patrick Hosking puts it in The Times, 'the ESG blancmange is starting to wobble'. One key issue is the definition of sustainable, ESG, or whatever you want to call any one firm's version of do-goodery. There are hordes of thoughts on this (Hosking mentions 14 different 'frameworks'), but no set standards.The first consequence is that pretty much anything bar fags, oil and gas can be labelled sustainable if you can just find the right framework. The second is that most ESG fund managers tend to make finding the framework easy by going for techy stuff (just seems cleaner, doesn't it?).\\u00a0Consider the top holdings of Liontrust's existing Sustainable Future Global Growth Fund: think Visa, Alphabet, PayPal, Autodesk (a software firm) and Iqvia (a health tech company). You get the picture. All too often ESG just means techy growth stuff. But you can get that kind of portfolio almost anywhere.Note too that (partly as a result of the recent flood of money into ESG) anything you can easily (for which read 'lazily') shoehorn into your ESG definitions is expensive. Anything you can't (without having to embrace the grubby nuances of real life) is not.This brings me neatly to the UK market. Wm Morrison has not often featured in ESG portfolios. It might have been winning awards for sustainable business practices for years. It might have been known for its social responsibility. It might have been cheap \\u2013 so cheap that US private-equity firms are now fighting over it. But I still don't know of a single ESG fund that owned it (email me if you do).UK fund managers are now muttering about it being sold too cheap. But it's a bit late for that. They should have bought more of it sooner \\u2013 then it wouldn't have been cheap in the first place.There's more on Morrisons in this week's magazine. But it is time for UK investors (who, despite pouring money into markets as a whole, pulled a net \\u00a3572m out of the UK in May) to take the huge hints private equity is dropping. This market is cheap; its stocks might not be the fun, fashionable, superficially clean tech stocks the modern fund manager fancies, but they aren't bad either.Is Alphabet really morally superior to a good supermarket? I pointed this out on Twitter. Simon French of Panmure Gordon (more from him on the podcast here) responded 'Rio Tinto. Yield of 5.5%. P/e of 6. Wrong price.' You won't find cheap Rio in most ESG funds. But you will find expensive electric car companies that can't survive without the copper it mines. How does that make sense?\\u00a0\\nTwo investment trusts that have proved their worthInvestment trustsTwo investment trusts that have proved their worthThese two investment trusts have earned investors' confidence since their flotations and remain solid bets, says Max King.25 Jun 2021\",\n",

Japan's 'smaller family-controlled\\u2026 companies without a successor' also offer rich pickings.\\u00a0Cheap financing from Japanese megabanks is augmenting the trend, Kazuhiro Yamada of private-equity group Carlyle tells the Financial Times. There have been 25 private-equity deals in Japan this year, worth $8.6bn, compared with $9.5bn for the whole of 2020, say Kana Inagaki and Leo Lewis in the Financial Times.Hedge funds are also getting in on the act, says Bei Hu on Bloomberg. Japan's small venture-capital industry means many of its start-ups list on public markets earlier than in other countries. That can cap the firms' growth: 'companies often get stuck with a market value below $300m and limited trading volume'.Japan, the world's third-largest economy, has a mere six 'unicorns' (a private start-up business with a value of over $1bn).

      "      \"excerpt\": \"The private-equity battle for Wm Morrison is intensifying now that it has accepted a bid from Fortress Investment. Matthew Partridge reports\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"'You wait ages for a bidder to emerge for one of the UK's big supermarket chains, then three turn up at once', says Dominic O'Connell on the BBC. Having recently turned down a takeover offer from US private-equity firm Clayton, Dubillier & Rice (CDR), Wm Morrison has just 'wrong-footed' the market by announcing a deal with a group of investors led by Fortress Investment. At 254p a share it represents a 42% premium to the supermarket's pre-bid share price. And a third private-equity group, Apollo, is 'considering its own offer'.The Fortress bid is certainly convenient for Wm Morrison's board, say Nils Pratley in The Guardian. Not only did it get a better offer than CDR's, but it also gives it the opportunity to claim the moral high ground by selling to an owner they claim has a 'long-term approach to investing'. But Fortress is 'not running a charity', while its commitments to good behaviour, including 'industry-beating pay rates for staff', are 'statements of intention' rather than legally binding 'post-offer undertakings'.\\u00a0Don't count on principle overriding profits, says Aimee Donnellan on Breakingviews. Whatever Wm Morrison's board decides, there's always the possibility that a new investor could go behind their backs by mounting a hostile takeover (bypassing the board and appealing directly to shareholders). Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that a bidder could offer 300p and still make a 'decent return' if they were 'prepared to ignore some of the employee-friendly promises made by Fortress'. At that price, institutional investors may swallow their complaints that private-equity firms 'fundamentally undervalue British companies and have little regard for the long-term health of the businesses they buy'.Whatever the outcome of the battle for Morrisons, the 'supermarket sweep' is likely to continue, says Sam Chambers in The Sunday Times. Private-equity firms who lose out on this deal may target other supermarkets, attracted by their 'stubbornly low share prices', especially when set against 'healthy cash generation and big property portfolios'. Technology companies, especially Amazon, could also join in the fun. In 2017 Amazon spent $13.7bn on US retailer Whole Foods and made an approach to Waitrose.Of the remaining supermarkets, Sainsbury's is most likely to be the next subject of a bidding war, says Laura Onita in The Daily Telegraph. Its assets are 'underpriced and highly cash generative', while it 'still has a lot of fat to burn', which gives any new investor plenty of room to increase profits further through cost-cutting. Billionaire investor Daniel Kretinsky, known as the 'Czech Sphinx', recently acquired a large shareholding in Sainsbury's. While Kretinsky claims the deal is part of a strategy 'to acquire minority stakes in companies that sell food', the move has sparked speculation that it could be a prelude to a bid to take the grocer private.\\u00a0\\nPrepare for a five-year property and stockmarket boomPropertyPrepare for a five-year property and stockmarket boomAn 18-year cycle based on land and housing drives economies and markets, says Akhil Patel.

      "      \"summary\": \"But Drappier worries a new Russian law on labelling imported champagne will undermine the principle he holds sacrosanct, that only champagne produced in France's Champagne region is worthy of the name. \\\"The word 'champagne' is magical,\\\" Drappier, 62, said at the vineyard that has been in his family for seven generations. \\\"We have to fight so that our name is recognised, and not diluted,\\\" he said, standing above dusty wine cellars that date back to the 12th century. Russia has adopted legislation which will require French producers to attach a label to the back of their bottles sold in Russia with the description \\\"sparkling wine.\\\" By contrast, domestic producers of what is known in Russia as \\\"shampanskoye\\\" will not have to attach any such label. Shares in a leading Russian producer went up after the law came into force. In more than 120 countries, the name \\\"champagne\\\" has protected status, reserving its use for sparkling wine from France's Champagne region. \\\"It's the world turned upside down,\\\" said Drappier, who took over the business from his 95-year-old father, and works alongside his three children. \\\"The Russians are putting 'Champagne\\\" on their labels and we're not allowed to.\\\" PRODUCERS \\\"IN SHOCK\\\" The French government has promised to react and warned it could seek redress through the World Trade Organisation. \\\"The champagne community is in shock,\\\" Charles Goemaere, head of the producer's lobby, told Reuters. He said Russia accounts for sales of about 2 million bottles per year for his members. Drappier's vineyard, about 230 km (143 miles) south-east of Paris, has been in his family since 1808. The Elysee Palace, official residence of the French president, is one of Drappier's customers. On the wall of the family home hangs a menu from the 2003 Group of Eight summit in Evian, southern France, when Drappier's champagne was served to Putin, along with other world leaders. Today, the vineyard sends between 50,000 and 70,00 bottles a year to Russia, which can account for up to 5% of its total sales. Drappier is now dealing with the logistical headache of getting the labels changed on the next consignments heading for Russia to add the term \\\"sparkling wine.\\\" But he is more worried that the Russian move could be the thin end of a wedge. \\\"It could give ideas to countries,\\\" he said. \\\"There will be Argentinian or Korean champagne, and in the long run that will be dangerous for us.\\\" \\\"It's the consumer who will be fooled. Is he drinking champagne, or Asian sparkling wine?.\\\" \\\"The whole world has recognised champagne as a global treasure. Those who want to attack it are kind of swindlers, or hooligans, who want to profit from the name,\\\" he said.

It is crucially important that central banks take the cross-border dimension into account,\\\" Jon Cunliffe, Chair of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and Deputy Governor for Financial Stability of the Bank of England, said in a report prepared for the G20 meeting in Italy. \\\"The implications of CBDCs, even if only intended for domestic use, will go beyond borders,\\\" added Tobias Adrian, Financial Counsellor and Director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department. The report said that facilitating international payments with CBDCs could be achieved through different degrees of integration and cooperation, ranging from basic compatibility with common standards to the establishment of international payment infrastructures. Inter-operability will be crucial while multilateral collaboration was also needed on the potential macrofinancial consequences CBDCs could cause, it said.

      "      \"summary\": \"The partners are jointly organizing demonstrations of these services in Brazzaville, Congo Brazzaville, July 9, 2021 - The Agency for Air Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar (ASECNA), Nigerian Communications Satellite Ltd. (NIGCOMSAT) and Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), are working together to accelerate the development of additional satellite services provided by ASECNA's A-SBAS (Satellite-Based Augmentation System) for Africa and the Indian Ocean to deliver precise point positioning (PPP, CNES/Geoflex) and danger warnings for a wide range of applications in Africa. The three partners successfully demonstrated the additional services provided by A-SBAS on July 7 and 8, 2021, by calling on the SBAS signal they have broadcast over the Africa & Indian Ocean (AFI) region since September 2020 to provide the first SBAS open service in this part of the world via the NigComSat-1R satellite. This trial follows successful flight demonstrations in January 2021 in Lom\\u00e9 and the following June in Douala. The first demonstration of the special urgent situation warning service via satellite showed the system's ability to broadcast a warning message via the A-SBAS signal to mobile phones, without requiring a terrestrial network. This service sends a message to the populations concerned, providing information on the type of danger and instructions to be followed. The second demonstration entailed the transmission of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) corrections based on CNES/Geoflex PPS technology and also using the A-SBAS signal. This approach showed the system's ability to achieve positioning accuracy to within centimeters across the entire African continent. A world first, this satellite service paves the way for applications in a broad range of sectors, including precision agriculture, land and maritime transport, rail safety, drone navigation, mapping and surveying. A seminar was also organized on July 6, 7 and 9 in Brazzaville to raise awareness of SBAS services in Africa. It was organized in conjunction with EGNOS-Africa JPO (Joint Program Office) and was attended by about 100 national and international experts. 'The demo in Brazzaville, Congo is in line with our desire to bring to the fore the numerous disruptive applications of SBAS technology utilizing precise point positioning (PPP) and warnings alerts in digitalized economy across many sectors especially in non-aviation sector such as maritime, rail, survey, civil engineering, oil & gas, precision agriculture, security of strategic national infrastructure, mass-market applications among others', declared Dr. Abimbola Alale, MD/CEO of NIGCOMSAT Ltd. 'It follows the policy direction of the Hon. Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami) FNCS, FBCS, FIIM, in utilization of NIGCOMSAT-1R for a digitalized economy for sustainable development in the continent.' 'Thales Alenia Space is the ideal partner to support Africa's efforts to implement its own SBAS system, based on our proven expertise in developing SBAS systems in Europe (EGNOS1) and South Korea (KASS),' said Benoit Broudy, Vice President, Navigation Business at Thales Alenia Space. 'This latest demonstration proved the ability of SBAS to transmit a warning about an imminent danger to the populations concerned and thus enhance their safety. A number of sectors, including agriculture and transport, will benefit from these precise satellite positioning services, accurate to within centimeters - and we have already proven their effectiveness. This latest success will help accelerate the rollout of SBAS and associated services in Africa.' 'I'm proud that ASECNA was able to demonstrate the utility and efficiency of SBAS services on our continent for all business sectors, and not just air transport,' said Mohamed Moussa, Director General of ASECNA. 'The upcoming deployment of the 'SBAS for Africa & Indian Ocean' system, a navigation and positioning solution for Africa and by Africa, will make a significant contribution to our continent economic and social development.' 1 European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System About ASECNA ASECNA is an International public organisation.

GTV has grown 76% year on year at the group level in the second quarter of 2021 to \\u00a31,739m (81% growth in constant currency). In the same period GTV in the UK and Ireland has grown 87% year on year to \\u00a3921m (88% growth in constant currency) and GTV in the Group's international segment has grown 65% year-on-year to \\u00a3818m (75% growth in constant currency).

In the same period orders in the UK and Ireland grew 94% year on year to 38m and orders in the Group's international segment grew 83% year-on-year to 40m.

Construction start was given as 2012, with the time until then needed to finalize the purchase and compensation for land and advertise for international tenders before selecting a main contractor. \\nThe new bridge is expected to ease the flow of traffic across the Nile, presently the only lifeline connecting the east of the country to the central part of Uganda and crucially important as an import and export axis between the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa and the hinterland countries of Rwanda, Burundi, Eastern Congo, Southern Sudan, and often even Western Tanzania, and, of course, Uganda itself.\\nA railway bridge near the old bridge across the Owens Falls hydroelectric dam is not capable of being converted for road traffic and is also expected to be upgraded when the rehabilitation of the main railway and conversion into the internationally accepted standard gauge goes underway.\\nThe old bridge, once the new one is operational, will be rehabilitated and used as a standby facility though not open for general traffic at that time.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"SMITHFIELD \\u2014 Ken Weber, the late outdoorsman, environmentalist and nature columnist for The Providence Journal, cut the trail here that's named in his honor.The short, simple trail along Cascade Brook fits Weber's view that hiking should not be a race through the woods but a chance to pause along the way, explore and think.'I don't consider walking a competitive sport or endurance event,' he wrote in \\\"Walks and Rambles in Rhode Island,\\\" one of several guides he authored. Many consider the book the bible of hiking in the state.'Those who plunge ahead \\u2014 never stopping, looking neither left nor right \\u2014 miss far too much. There is so much beauty, history and wildlife along these routes that it would be a shame not to see as much as possible, and that takes a little slowing down,' he wrote.Walking RI: 5 best family-friendly hikes around RI for nature loversWalking RI: The electrifying past of Glocester's Hawkins PondNotes from young hikersWeber and his wife, Bettie, planned, laid out and maintained the Ken Weber Conservation Area at Cascade Brook, which starts at the end of a short, dead-end road off Putnam Pike.I set out from the trailhead, noted the map with Weber's picture at an information board and followed a blue-blazed path, once called Pig Run, for a few steps before the path turned right and through a stone wall. The trail follows some hard-packed dirt and a ledge before quickly reaching a colorful box stuffed with hand-written testimonials from young hikers.'My favorite place,' wrote Robbie.The trail also passes a boulder with a neat sign:\\u00a0'Out of crowded dinsOn ancient pathways intoFreshets of whispers'The path from there meanders under oaks, beeches and maples before reaching a small clearing. Cascade Brook flows slowly from the northwest on the flat, forest floor before tumbling down a 15-foot ledge. The better views of the small waterfall are from below, though, and come later in the hike.I followed the blue-blazed trail up a hillside, along the base of a huge rock outcropping and by some stone walls. The path may have been an old farm lane, as it loops along the perimeter of the 27-acre preserve and under pine trees and over soft needles.Walking RI: Cultural connections on a Berkshires road tripTaking a side trail, I walked to the top of the hill and found an orchard with dozens of mature and newly planted fruit trees, perhaps part of Steere Orchard. There are new fence posts on the edge of the land, perhaps to keep hikers from wandering onto the private property to pick apples.A curious relicReturning to the main path, I walked downhill around boulders and over ledges and found a curiosity \\u2014 a 5-foot brick chimney standing on a 10-foot square concrete foundation. The base of the unusual chimney had four fireplaces, one on each side.Walking RI: Bay views and WWII history at Beavertail State ParkThere are also the remains of cement posts on the ledges and a small rectangularstructure made of cement.One clue to their origins is a date etched in the foundation:\\u00a0May 4, 1942.I learned later that the structure was part of a campsite, recreation area and shrine built by youngsters who lived at St. Aloysius Home about three-quarters of a mile away, according to the Smithfield Historical Society. The orphanage, home to up to 224 children, was owned and run by the Catholic Diocese of Providence and had a Boy Scout Troop.Walking RI: Hunt for RI's rare state rock at Cumberland's Blackall/Ballou PreserveAt one time, the site also had an altar, table and grotto with a religious statue, and it was used for years for picnics. Little remains, except for the chimney and posts.I sat there for a few minutes on a ledge on the overgrown site and tried to picture what it must have looked like 75 years ago, with all the kids enjoying the outdoors.Weber must have known the history and planned the trail to pass through the site.When I decided it was time to move on, I got back on the trail and followed the blue blazes that circled the boundaries of the public property.After crossing a stone wall, the path edges a marshy area and Stillwater River to the south.\\u00a0 There's a glimpse of some old textile mills that date to the 1800s and later became the Greenville Finishing Company. They are now antiques shops and small businesses.The trail loops back along Cascade Brook and to the base of the waterfall I had seen from above.Fun in the sun: From beaches to trails, there's plenty to do in RI this summerAfter a recent rainstorm, there was a gush of falling water that filled a shallow pool below in a rocky bowl. Water also seeped in streams out of the ledges.But when I've been there after a long dry spell, water only trickles over the deep-green, mossy ledges in a thin horsetail of water. In the winter, I've marveled at 10-foot icicles sparkling in the sun and dripping into the icy stream below.It's a place to pause and ponder, as Weber would have recommended.I climbed a short, steep grade to the right of the waterfall, crossed Cascade Brook and took the trail back to where I started. In all, I hiked 1.2 miles for about 90 minutes, with several stops.Ken Weber's enduring legacyWhen Weber cut the trail, he was working at The Journal and writing his Saturday morning column about his nature walks.I remember him as a good editor who came from Ohio and liked to talk baseball. He was generous with his time, and when I asked, he offered hiking tips and recommendations about places to go.I once asked him to lead a group of Scouts along the Mount Tom Trail in Arcadia, and as we walked he pointed out sights that we would never have noticed, such as two warring armies of ants marching toward\\u00a0each other.Walking RI: Over the rivers and through the woods on Mount Tom TrailWhen I walk around Rhode Island these days, hikers I meet still mention Weber, who died in 2007. When I asked a trail manager at Fort Nature Preserve in Smithfield about the benches on the banks of a pond, he recalled that during his rounds of the refuge, he often saw Weber patiently sitting there at dusk, waiting for the beavers to pop up.Walking RI: On the trail of critters at Fort Wildlife RefugeWalking RI: Nature in freeze-frame at Smithfield's Wolf Hill Forest PreserveWeber also was an active member of the Audubon Society and the Conservation Commission in Smithfield, where he lived. There's another trail he cut that's named for him in the town's Wolf Hill Forest.At the base of the Wolf Hill trails, alongside Stump Pond and just outside the conservation center, there's a bronze plaque dedicated to Weber and his 30 years of public service promoting hiking in Rhode Island.The inscription reads: \\\"Ken walked gently in nature and shared what he saw in his writings with quiet eloquence, deep respect, wonder and humor.\\\"That's quite a legacy.Trail TipJohn Kostrzewa will discuss Walking Rhode Island and recommend easy and moderate trails during a presentation Aug. 3 at 6:30 p.m. at the Cranston Public Library.

MSN and The Points Guy may receive a commission from card issuers. Despite not being a member of a major alliance, Emirates lets you earn and redeem Skywards miles with more than a dozen partner airlines. Among them is JetBlue.Since the beginning of the partnership, you could only use Emirates miles to book JetBlue economy flights. However, as reported by NerdWallet, that's no longer the case.Effective immediately, you can redeem Emirates Skywards miles for both economy and Mint (business class) flights on JetBlue. Even better, the redemption rates can oftentimes actually be a good deal.For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox,\\u00a0sign up for our daily newsletter.Emirates' JetBlue award chartAs with most of its mileage partners, Emirates now prices JetBlue awards based on the distance flown. In the past, these awards were priced by specific routes.Emirates' award chart for JetBlue flights is as follows. As you can see, Mint is always double the price of economy. One-way distance (miles) Economy Mint 0-250 8,000 miles 16,000 miles 251-500 10,000 miles 20,000 miles 501-1,000 14,000 miles 28,000 miles 1,001-2,000 20,000 miles 40,000 miles 2,001-3,000 26,000 miles 52,000 miles 3,001-4,000 32,000 miles 64,000 miles 4,001-5,000 38,000 miles 76,000 miles 5,001-6,000 44,000 miles 88,000 miles 6,001-7,000 50,000 miles 100,000 miles 7001-15,000 60,000 miles 120,000 miles JetBlue's Mint product is offered on transcontinental and select Caribbean flights and will soon launch on flights between the East Coast and London. In other words, most Mint awards will cost between 40,000 and 64,000 miles each way.To give you an idea, here are the rates for some popular Mint routes: New York-JFK to Aruba (AUA): 40,000 miles (1,951 miles in distance) New York-JFK to Los Angeles (LAX): 52,000 miles (2,475 miles in distance) Boston (BOS) to San Francisco (SFO): 52,000 miles (2,704 miles in distance) Los Angeles (LAX) to Miami (MIA): 52,000 miles (2,342 miles in distance) New York-JFK to London Heathrow (LHR): 64,000 miles (3,451 miles in distance) Related: What it was like to fly JetBlue's new Mint business class \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 The Points Guy (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy)\\n\\n\\nBooking JetBlue awards with EmiratesAlthough Emirates' search tool can be a bit wonky, these awards can be booked online.In the search box on Emirates' website, click 'Advanced search: multi-city, promo codes, partner airlines.' \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 The Points Guy (Screenshot courtesy of emirates.com)\\n\\n\\nThen, select 'book classic rewards flight,' 'search partner flights only' and type in your itinerary. Based on our experiences, you shouldn't check the 'flexible dates' box as that results in an error message. \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 The Points Guy (Screenshot courtesy of emirates.com)\\n\\n\\nAs long as there's \\u2018I' fare availability, it should be bookable through Emirates. Your best bet would be to use ExpertFlyer to search inventory and set alerts if there's no availability. (ExpertFlyer is owned by TPG's parent company, Red Ventures.) \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 The Points Guy (Screenshot courtesy of emirates.com)\\n\\n\\nThat said, as I mentioned, Emirates' website isn't perfect. There will be times when an award should be available but won't show on Emirates' website. For instance, you can't search for awards between New York-JFK and London yet.In these cases, call Emirates Skywards to book your awards over the phone. As an added benefit, phone agents can even put awards on hold for you. This is useful for when you want to book a flight but still need to transfer miles into your account.Related: Best ways to redeem Emirates Skywards miles for maximum valueIs it worth it?While redeeming Emirates miles for JetBlue economy flights is rarely a good deal, the same can't be said for Mint redemptions.Let's take a look at the nation's most premier route: New York-JFK to Los Angeles (LAX). Right now, the cheapest Mint fare you can find on this route is $898 one-way. When redeeming 52,000 miles for that ticket, you'll get about 1.7 cents in value per mile.Is this the maximum value you can get from your miles? No, but it still is a very solid deal. After all, TPG valuations typically peg Skywards miles at just 1.2 cents apiece. \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 The Points Guy (Screenshot courtesy of google.com)\\n\\n\\nBy comparison, JetBlue's own TrueBlue program is charging at least 82,200 TrueBlue points for the same flights. Since the program prices awards dynamically, you'll rarely ever get more than 1.3 cents in value per point.Related: The cheapest way to fly in JetBlue's premium Mint cabin \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 The Points Guy (Screenshot courtesy of jetblue.com)\\n\\n\\nYou'll get a similar value from your Emirates miles when redeeming for JetBlue's new flights to London. Flights across the pond are currently pricing around $1,000 each way when booking a round-trip ticket. So, based on the 64,000-mile rate, you'll get about 1.6 cents in value per mile. However, if you only need a one-way ticket, the cash fare jumps to over $2,500. In that case, using miles is truly a no-brainer as you'll get nearly four cents in value per mile.Obviously, the redemption value will vary based on the cash prices but as you can see, there will be times where it makes sense to redeem your miles. Considering JetBlue often offers Mint fares to the Caribbean for under $300 each way, those redemptions will likely be harder to justify.Earning Emirates milesThe most exciting part of all of this is how easy Emirates miles are to earn. Even if you've never flown on the Dubai-based carrier, you can transfer points to its Skywards program from all major transferable points programs. This includes\\u00a0Chase Ultimate Rewards (1:1 ratio), Amex Membership Rewards (1:1), Citi ThankYou Rewards (1:1), Capital One Miles (2:1) and Marriott Bonvoy (3:1 with a 5,000-mile bonus for every 60,000 Marriott points transferred).In other words, if you have a credit card that earns flexible points, then chances are you can transfer your rewards to Emirates to book these awards. While JetBlue also partners with all major transferable points programs, the transfer ratios are sometimes less attractive.Related: The easiest airline miles to earn and why you want themBottom lineThere historically haven't been many good ways to book JetBlue Mint flights with points. The best option has often been to book through Chase Ultimate Rewards or another travel portal and redeem your points at a fixed value.Needless to say, the ability to redeem Emirates Skywards miles for JetBlue Mint is a welcome addition. Emirates miles are extremely easy to earn and the value to be had with these redemptions can be compelling. Depending on the route, there's a good chance you'll pay fewer miles than if you were to book through JetBlue's own TrueBlue program.Featured photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy.

No countries on the red list have become amber or green.\\nThis is despite the recent revelation that \\u2013 of the 24,511 red-list arrivals tested since May 20 \\u2013 only 435 (1.8 per cent) tested positive. Of those 435 cases, 341 were coming in from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, which are all already on the red list.\\nThe traffic light lists of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can potentially be different to England's, so check the advice on the relevant government websites.\\nBritons returning to England from red-listed destinations will continue to face a 10-day stay in a quarantine hotel at a cost of up to \\u00a31,750, including Covid tests on day two and eight of their quarantine. Any non-Britons who have been in a red list country within the past 10 days will simply be denied entry to the country.\\nThe rating of each country is decided based on the proportion of its population that has been vaccinated, its infection rates, the prevalence of variants of concern and its capacity to sequence their genomes.\\nTurkey, Nepal and the Maldives were among those placed on the red list in May, with the travel restrictions being enforced from May 12, following India's addition on April 19, amid concern over the Delta variant that was first recorded there and a recent record-breaking surge in cases in the country. On June 8, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, Bahrain, Sudan, Trinidad and Tobago and Afghanistan joined the list.\\nAll travellers must fill out a passenger locator form and secure proof of a negative Covid-19 test result before departure to England. The test must be taken within three days of departure.\\nThose travelling from green destinations must then pay for a PCR test on or before their second day back in England. Those returning from an amber country have to quarantine at home for up to 10 days. They must take two PCR tests when back, on days two and eight. They can pay for an additional test on day five to potentially reduce their time in self-isolation under the Test to Release scheme. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has confirmed that from July 19 fully vaccinated Britons will be able to avoid quarantine on their return from amber-list destinations but will still be subject to testing.\\nThose returning from the red list countries must still pay \\u00a31,750 to spend that time in a quarantine hotel, however recent reports suggest those in financial hardship may be able to avoid the large fee.\\nSince February 15, arrivals who try to cover up their arrival from a red list country also face jail sentences of up to 10 years, whilst anyone who tries to avoid mandatory hotel quarantine will face fines of up to \\u00a310,000.\\nA fine also enforces the testing system. Travellers arriving from any country could be fined \\u00a3500 if they do not have a valid test result.\",\n",

The Palace Armoury is one of the world's largest collections of arms and armor that is still housed in its original building. The website offers four online exhibits one can look through, photo galleries and two museum views as if one were standing inside the museum.\\n\\nAlso in Valletta, one can virtually visit Fort St. Elmo National War Museum. Artifacts are displayed in chronological order, commencing from the early phases of the Bronze Age around 2,500 B.C. Two halls are dedicated to Malta's important role in WWI, the Inter-War Period and Malta's historical role in the Second World War where the Gloster Sea Gladiator N5520 FAITH, Roosevelt's Jeep \\u2018Husky' and Malta award for gallantry, the George Cross are displayed. This site includes one online exhibit, a photo gallery and 10 museum views that viewers can explore.\\n\\n\\u0126al Saflieni Hypogeum is located in Ra\\u0127al \\u0120did. This Hypogeum is a rock-cut underground complex that was used both as a sanctuary as well as for burial purposes by the temple builders. It was discovered during construction in 1902. There are three underground levels that date from around 3600 to 2400 BC. There is one online exhibit unveiling an underground prehistoric cemetery, a photo gallery and one museum view.\\n\\nThere are seven Megalithic Temples found on the islands of Gozo and Malta, each a result of individual development. Five out of the seven can be virtually visited. The \\u0120gantija Temples in Xag\\u0127ra, Gozo are the oldest, free-standing monuments in the world and are a testament to the Island's inhabitation for at least 1,000 years before the famous Egyptian pyramids of Giza were constructed. On the website viewers can look at one online exhibit, a photo gallery and three museum views.\\n\\nMusicians and singers in Malta are following suit in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and sharing their performances online for all to appreciate. Malta's tenor, Joseph Calleja asked his fans to request songs and arias they would like to hear him sing on his Facebook page.\\n\\nHeritage Malta is also known for organizing yearly events for the public to witness the Spring equinox and this year it was canceled due to COVID-19. Instead, they live-streamed the event on their Facebook page so no one would miss out! The event marks the special relationship between the temples and the seasons. As the first rays of the sun projected themselves through the main doorway of the southern Mnajdra temples, viewers were able to witness the spring equinox online.\\n\\nAbout Malta\\n\\nThe sunny islands of Malta, in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, are home to a most remarkable concentration of intact built heritage, including the highest density of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in any nation-state anywhere. Valletta built by the proud Knights of St. John is one of the UNESCO sights and the European Capital of Culture for 2018. Malta's patrimony in stone ranges from the oldest free-standing stone architecture in the world, to one of the British Empire's most formidable defensive systems, and includes a rich mix of domestic, religious and military architecture from the ancient, medieval and early modern periods. With superbly sunny weather, attractive beaches, a thriving nightlife and 7,000 years of intriguing history, there is a great deal to see and do.

      "      \"excerpt\": \"We've crunched the numbers \\u2013 those without both jabs may have to fork out \\u00a3100 more to holiday in amber list countries\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"Holidaymakers received a much-needed boost yesterday, after it was announced that fully vaccinated British residents returning from amber list countries would no longer have to quarantine from July 19.\\nThe Government decision means a host of European holiday favourites, including Spain and Greece, are back on the table this summer. And the scrapping of quarantine isn't the only perk for vaccinated travellers. While some testing requirements will remain when returning home (a pre-departure rapid test and PCR on day two after arrival), they will no longer need to take an additional PCR test eight days after they come home. Furthermore, certain European destinations have waived the need for double-jabbed visitors to show evidence of a negative test on arrival.\\nAll this means that many of those without two doses could be priced out of holidays this summer. Of course, with the vaccine programme only opened up to over-18s on June 17, it's likely it will be younger adults who'll have to fork out or miss out. Data from Public Health England shows that by the end of last month, only 18 per cent of those between 25 and 29 were fully vaccinated, that figure dropping to 15 per cent for those aged 18 to 24.\\nHere, we've crunched the numbers to see just how much more unvaccinated travellers will have to pay if they want to travel to certain amber list countries this summer.\\nTo calculate the testing costs, we're using pricing from some of the most reasonable (and Government-approved) providers \\u2013 at-home PCR tests from Randox (\\u00a348) and remotely supervised rapid antigen tests from Qured (\\u00a339). It's worth noting that many test providers, particularly those with quick turnaround times, charge much more for swabs and that the following are conservative estimates of the costs some travellers might face.\\nSpain\\nFully vaccinated total test cost: \\u00a387Unvaccinated total test cost: \\u00a3183 (or \\u00a3231 for test to release)\\nGood news: fully vaccinated travellers do not need to take a Covid test to enter Spain, Britain's favourite holiday destination. Therefore, from July 19, the testing cost for inoculated holidaymakers is limited to a rapid antigen (\\u00a339) before departure to the UK and PCR test (\\u00a348) on the second day of their return. Meanwhile, those who've received one or no dose of the vaccine must provide evidence of a PCR test (\\u00a348) to enter Spain and an antigen (\\u00a339) before leaving. Back home, they must take a PCR test on day two and eight, racking up another \\u00a396. This leads to a grand total of \\u00a3183, which rises to \\u00a3231 if you want to opt into the \\u2018test to release' system and take an additional PCR test on day five to end your quarantine early.\\nNote that the cost for unvaccinated visitors to the green watchlist Balearic Islands would be slightly less at \\u00a3135, as there is no need to take a day eight test.\\nFrance\\nFully vaccinated total test cost: \\u00a3127Unvaccinated total test cost: Not applicable\\nThose who've received two doses still need to provide evidence of a rapid antigen (\\u00a339) or PCR test when heading to France which, added to the \\u00a387 for the combined UK testing requirements, means travellers must fork out \\u00a3127 a head. The outlook is bleak for those without both jabs who want to hop on the Eurostar this summer \\u2013 France is currently closed to unvaccinated UK leisure travellers, with the country only granting entry to those with \\u2018essential reasons'.\\nItaly\\nFully vaccinated total test cost: \\u00a3152Unvaccinated total test cost: \\u00a3200 (or \\u00a3248 for test to release)\\nItaly requires all arrivals, regardless of vaccination status, to show evidence of an antigen (\\u00a339) or PCR test, taken within the last 48 hours. Currently a tricky holiday proposition, until at least the end of July all UK visitors must also quarantine for five days, though there could be worse fates than holing up in a Tuscan villa. At the end of the isolation period they need to take an antigen or PCR test with a negative result for release. This test must be paid for by the traveller and while various regions have different caps on test prices, an antigen test won't usually cost more than \\u20ac30 (\\u00a326). The usual UK testing requirements apply and those without both jabs will also have to take an additional PCR test, leaving testing for a holiday to Italy costing upwards of \\u00a3200 per person.\\nPortugal\\nFully vaccinated total test cost: \\u00a387 (Madeira); \\u00a3126 (mainland Portugal)Unvaccinated total test cost: \\u00a3174 (Madeira); mainland Portugal is not a viable holiday option.\\nIf you travel to mainland Portugal from the UK, you must quarantine for 14 days unless you can prove you are fully vaccinated, essentially rendering holidays off-limits for those who aren't. Those who have been inoculated still need to show proof of a recent negative antigen (\\u00a339) or PCR test and pay for the tests the UK Government requires on return.\\nHowever, Madeira is allowing entry to unvaccinated holidaymakers, so long as they provide that all-important antigen (\\u00a339) or PCR test. Those with both jabs are exempt from the testing requirement. As the archipelago is a green watchlist destination, British travellers must take one test before departure and one PCR test before day two of arrival in the UK.\\nGreece\\nFully vaccinated total test cost: \\u00a387Unvaccinated total test cost: \\u00a3183 (or \\u00a3231 for test to release)\\nSimilarly to Spain, fully vaccinated people looking to holiday in Greece or its islands do not need to worry about taking a test before they go. They must however adhere to the Government's new testing rules for vaccinated amber list travellers (a combined cost of \\u00a387). Unfortunately for those who haven't had both jabs, they must take a rapid antigen test (\\u00a339) 48 hours before departure or a PCR test (\\u00a348) 72 hours before. They must then go through the rigmarole of the UK amber list testing regime, which includes a pre-departure rapid antigen test (\\u00a339) and two PCR tests (\\u00a396), or three (\\u00a3144) if you want to escape quarantine early.\\nWhat about testing costs for unvaccinated children returning from amber list countries?\\nChildren aged over 11 will have to take pre-departure tests (\\u00a339) and a PCR test (\\u00a348) on or before day two after their arrival back in the UK. Those aged five to 11 have to take just the PCR test on arrival. This means a family of four, with two vaccinated adults and two teenage children, could face combined testing costs of \\u00a3348 to return to the home. This is without factoring in entry testing requirements for children, which vary between countries.\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"When you visit a new place, always check out the local market.\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"I sat down at a rickety plastic table, held in balance with one leg propped up by a stone. The coffee stall owner came over, held up two fingers in a victory sign and I nodded with a knowing smile. In a jiffy, he brought over two cups of teh (milk tea) and placed them on the table, one for me and one for my wife who was shopping for groceries nearby. I whipped out my phone and started scrolling. It was my regular Saturday at the morning market in Alam Jaya, Selangor, surrounded by familiar faces, sights, smells and a cacophony of noises, all things familiar and re-assuring \\u2013 my comfort zone, a non-event. Before the movement control order began, I was quite a regular traveller. Wherever I went and whenever possible, I would visit the local wet market instead of being holed up in the cosy comfort of the hotel watching TV while waiting for the rest of the gang to get ready to set out for the day. I like to touch base with the local environment and local people and I believe the best place to learn the life and lifestyle of the locals is the wet market where you can see, smell, feel and eat their specialties and culinary preferences. Even when I worked in London, I would go with my wife to the wet market on Church Street, a side street off Edgeware Avenue, a walking distance from where we lived in Randolph Avenue. We would comb the market, buying fruits and vegetables, and oh, especially cherries, for the week. 'A pound for a pound!' the potato vendor would call out. He would address every woman shopper as 'darling', a term of endearment similar to 'Leng Lui' (beautiful girl) which our local wet market fellas would use regardless of age and looks. But my best discovery there was the salmon fish heads. They were selling them for 50 pence (just under RM3 today) a piece with plenty of meat still attached. I was told they used to give them away for free until they found out that Asians, maybe mostly Malaysians, loved them and so they upped the price. My wife would cook up a wok of fish head curry with lady's fingers and eggplants. While the fish head was dirt cheap, the vegetables, obviously imported, cost an arm and a leg. Cost aside, the dish was sumptuous and hugely therapeutic in somewhat curing our homesickness! Once in a while, we would walk to the end of Church Street where they sold clothes and other household stuff which were a bit cheaper than those in the high street shopping malls. And so I went 'marketing' happily with my wife pulling our own little trolley on weekends until one fine morning we met an elderly lady at the bus stand. 'Good morning, where are you going?' she asked with a smile. 'Marketing, ' I answered politely. 'You mean going to the wet market?' she questioned, spying our little trolley. 'Yes.' 'No, that's shopping and not marketing!' she corrected me, 'marketing means doing sales and promotion.' That set me thinking as to us, the word 'marketing' had become a convenient and elastic word to apply for every type of buying activity. But after that conversation, I became more mindful in using the word 'shopping' and 'marketing'. Sadly, when I returned to Malaysia, I reverted to my lazy English and go 'marketing', fitting nicely into the local environment. My trips to the wet market also had its unpleasant surprises. I remember one such experience was in Guangzhou, China, with my former colleague Foong Ten Chee who, like me, loves to comb the local wet market, especially the hawker food section. That day we walked the wet and dirty alleys looking at stalls selling all kinds of meat, vegetables and a huge array of cooked food. Suddenly he came to a dead stop. Pointing at a stall with a row of carcasses suspended on hooks, he cried, 'Dogs!'. I turned and saw a row of dog carcasses, bloodlessly white, hanging there for sale. I cringed at the unpleasant sight, quickened my steps before my knees went soft. The sight just put me off even though the locals would mill around the stall as if it was selling pork, mutton or beef. The ugly sight still remains fresh in my mind even after many years. I suppose it's more a cultural difference that many of us cannot stand the sight of slaughtered dogs and yet feeling comfortable looking at slaughtered cow heads and goat heads with glassy eyes on display at the butcher's stall! Of course, if you were a bit more adventurous, you could also find stalls where snakes are being skinned alive. Much as I hate snakes, to skin them while they are still writhing is something hard to bear. In Southern China, dog meat and snake soup are popular especially in autumn. Many believe these soups give them energy to warm up their bodies in preparation for the cold winter. To many of us not accustomed to such food, it's a big yuck!Hoo Ban Khee is a former correspondent for The Star, in Beijing, China. He can be contacted at hoobankhee@gmail.com.\",\n",

NHS Covid certification letter - Simon Calder People who have been vaccinated abroad will be able to visit the UK from 'amber list' countries later this summer, the transport secretary has said.Yesterday Grant Shapps said that arrivals in England from medium-risk nations such as France, Italy, Greece and the US would be able to avoid quarantine \\u2013 but only if they had been vaccinated in the UK.While dozens of overseas countries accept NHS vaccination certification, the UK will not recognise immunisation of people abroad.With British travellers currently banned from going to the US, many people with family across the Atlantic were dismayed to discover that self-isolation rules will continue for people who have been vaccinated abroad.Speaking to Sky News, the transport secretary said: 'That will be phase two of it, and something that we're very actively working on at the moment.'Of course with the UK vaccination programme you are able to demonstrate your vaccination status very easily. 'Once you've been fully vaccinated [the NHS app] gives you a certificate that you can show on screen or download.'So it's easy for us to be able to use that to demonstrate the status of somebody returning home. That's the first stage.'The next stage is to recognise apps or certification from other countries.'Mr Shapps said the US had '50 different systems, one for each state, largely paper based' and that it was 'easier done from some places like the EU where they have a digital app coming along'.The EU digital covid certificate has been in operation everywhere except Ireland since the start of July.He said he would be able to say more about foreign-vaccinated visitors 'in the next couple of weeks'.Questioned about the requirement for PCR tests on arrival for children as young as five, he said that the test was the best way to protect public health.Mr Shapps repeated the assertion that people should not be going to amber-list countries on holiday. The law banning non-essential international travel was lifted on 17 May.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Tour operators and trade bodies have warned that the cost of PCR testing for travel is still a major deterrent to travel despite quarantine being dropped for those returning to England from amber list destinations from July 19.Transport secretary Grant Shapps' statement yesterday, while welcomed, was labelled 'too little too late' and there were warnings that there was 'still a long way to go' before holidays are 'truly affordable'.The concerns were raises despite Foreign Office travel warnings against amber list countries being lifted to many destinations lifted, enabling holidaymakers to get travel insurance for places such as Spain, France, Greece, Morocco and Switzerland.Aito head of commercial Bharat Gadhoke said 'it's good finally to be able to offer viable holidays to many amber destinations for Aito clients to book', but stressed: 'This statement has been long overdue, but we are pleased, at long last, to have some positive news.He added: 'We now have to hope that all destinations to which we can travel will, indeed, accept British travellers without undue barriers to entry.'But Gadhoke said the cost of PCR testing is still too high, saying the transport secretary's comments that some cost 'around a tenner' was 'way off the mark', suggesting prices range from \\u00a343 to \\u00a3120.'Big travel companies might be subsidising tests, but \\u00a343 per test is the best market rate available to SMEs such as Aito members,' he said. 'It's an easy problem to solve \\u2013 either permit use of lateral flow tests, which cost about \\u00a329, or reduce the cost of PCR tests to that charged in Europe, which is circa \\u20ac12 to \\u20ac15.'Another quick fix would be to use NHS testing capacity, and to ensure that a modest fee is fed back into NHS funding \\u2013 that would be a great win: win, particularly as it would ensure that legitimate testing would be available to all.'Peter Liney, chief executive of Great Rail Journeys, warned the pandemic 'simply isn't over' for the travel industry despite the announcement.He said: 'The pandemic has taken its toll on many businesses across a wide range of sectors, but none have been as hard hit as the travel industry.'Citing research by the operator that found 72% of customers won't travel overseas until they feel confident their plans won't change last minute, he said: 'Many are waiting to book and have ruled out an overseas holiday until next year.'The government's proposal to allow fully-vaccinated people to travel to amber list countries without the need to self-isolate is too little too late. This will not give them the confidence they need to travel, only 34% of our customers said they would travel overseas if this change was made. Most still say they will not.He added that customers 'still have to navigate restrictions on UK travellers imposed by the countries they are visiting, leading to even more uncertainty, particularly when our infection rates are rising so dramatically'.Liney warned that PCR testing, which remains in place for day two for those returning from amber list countries, is 'still a big turn-off'.'It's not just the cost that's an issue, it's also the hassle of having to organise it,' he said, noting that a further 72% of GRJ customers said even if they are allowed to travel, the hassle of PCR testing, pre and post travel, is putting them off.Liney said: 'The government's insistence on PCR testing seems nonsensical when you see thousands of people crowded into Wimbledon and Wembley, at a time when infection rates are booming, with only a negative lateral flow test required.'There is clearly not going to be a meaningful return to overseas travel this year.'Jason Oshiokpekhai, managing director of Global Travel Collection UK, agreed the announcement didn't go far enough.He said: 'While this is a positive step in the right direction for the overall travel industry, the UK government is failing to address the reopening of key business routes between the UK and the US, which is what our global economy is waiting for.'It has been weeks since the so-called Atlantic Charter was established yet why are we no further forward? The US sits static on the amber list as a gesture but there is no tangible benefit without a focussed and urgent approach to really reopening these routes.'He also said the cost of testing 'is still far too high' and 'especially for those who have been double vaccinated' and urged the government to work with other countries to ensure more than 30 accept the NHS app as proof of vaccination status, which he said was 'not anywhere near good enough'.The World Travel and Tourism Council senior vice president Virginia Messina said the sector 'will breathe a sigh of relief' now that quarantine-free holidays have been given the green light by the government for those that have been fully-jabbed.But she said: 'While it's a step in the right direction, there is still a long way to go before holidays become truly affordable \\u2013 and accessible. The requirement for PCR tests to return from amber list countries will remain, pricing out many hard-working families from being able to take holidays abroad.'And though it's great news for the double jabbed and under-18s who also are exempt from quarantines, it still leaves more than one in three UK adults who've only received a single dose, forced into quarantine when they arrive back in the UK from an amber list country.'Countries must take a coordinated and harmonised approach and align policies to avoid confusion among holidaymakers who need easy to understand rules and regulations more than ever before.'Abby Penston, chief executive of Focus Travel Partnership, cautioned that 'this is not a return to normality'.She said: 'Business travellers, who are residents, from amber countries still have to self-isolate when they arrive in the UK and it does not sound like they will be exempt from these measures until later in the summer.'We understand the need for a safe and responsible return to travel \\u2013 and this is a start \\u2013 but I fear the reasons for these delays are administrative and political, which means a recovery is being hobbled.'So we were disappointed that the transport secretary evaded the request to extend furlough for our sector.'US routes are key for our sector \\u2013 pre-pandemic they made up over 30% of turnover for Focus Travel Partnership TMC businesses \\u2013 and ensuring these routes are fully up and running will be essential to revival.'The Unite union's national officer for aviation Oliver Richardson said:\\u00a0'Whilst it is a positive move to largely remove the quarantine rules for amber list countries, it remains unclear as to why this approach wasn't adopted earlier, which would have allowed the industry to properly plan for an increase in demand.'The lifting of restrictions on quarantine for countries with lower infection rates is welcome, however the significant increase in rates in the UK means that many countries are taking a cautious approach to UK visitors.'Now that the UK has left the EU there is no unified or consistent approach as to how\\u00a0travellers\\u00a0are categorised and there are a multitude of restrictions. This is both confusing to deal with and complicated to navigate.'\",\n",

PHOTO | POOL \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy PURITY WANJOHI\\nMore by this Author\\n \\n\\n\\n It has been my goal to explore destinations away from the wilderness, sand and sea. Places that offer solitude but less than three-hour's drive from Nairobi. Where I can take a day trip and come back feeling recharged. I had heard of Camp Ndunda located in Njukiri Forest in Embu County, famed for its breath-taking canopy walk on a suspended bridge and the peaceful walk through the forest.After a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Nairobi, I step into this 450 acres of forest. It carries within it a rich variety of flora and fauna- mainly birds \\u2014 and is home to the twin falls called Ndunda, which means a large fruit. My friends and I began with a 2.1-kilometre nature trail, upon paying the entry fee of Sh350 at a modern hut thatched with grass which is the reception. A wooden gate with inspirational nature quotes ushers us in. You might want to have a pair of hiking shoes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe starting point of the 2.1 kilometre long Nature Trail at Camp Ndunda, Njukiri Forest Embu County. PHOTO | POOLFrancis Kabuga is the man we were to follow as we sought to unearth the treasure here. He has been doing this for the past one and a half years.'It should be boring by now considering it's the same route day in, day out?' I ask him as we zigzagged along pathways, gradually settling into a rhythm.On either side are blackberry shrubs. Overshadowing them are large Meru Oaks and Eucalyptus trees. I have always heard of the mulberry shrub. But today I see one\\u2014 a red mulberry shrub with clusters of red fruit. They are juicy and slightly sweet, which must delight the birds that are chirping all around us. Tea baskets are the litter collections bins. How eco-friendly!Mr Kabuga, who is slightly taken aback by my excitement at the mulberries, responds with a question, 'Do you get bored writing?'Fair question.Wafting through the air is the scent of nature, a mix of the slightly wet red soil, trees and berries; simple things I miss by living in a city choked with pollution.There are pockets of resting spots for those who choose to spend their time under this man-made part of the forest. They are picnicking spots with seats.The forest, with over 30 species of trees, is partly natural and partly man-made planted through conservation efforts. It is managed by the Kenya Forest Service and the Njukiri Community Forest Association.The land on which it stands was almost laid bare but a concerted effort by the community and the government brought it back to life again.It is this quiet, that courts over 3,500 visitors every year to the forest. The majority come from Embu, Meru, Kirinyaga and Nairobi. As the numbers grow, the forest has become a source of income and pride for the community around it. It is a perfect example of what can happen when man and nature live together in harmony.Minutes later, my eyes and ears are alive to the sight and sound of gushing water of River Rupingazi. We are at the Ndunda twin falls whose waters are clear. From their source at Mt. Kenya, the cascading waters falls 12 metres down into the plunge pool below, fast in one, slow and steady in the other. These twin falls are lorded over by tall indigenous trees.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne half of the Twin Ndunda Falls at Camp Ndunda in Njukiri Forest, Embu County. PHOTO | POOLPeople are normally allowed to swim but only with a swimming instructor provided upon request. Other activities are the water up-thrust where you dive from the waterfalls, Tarzan-like wild swing, which you use to swing you from one side of the river to the other like a pendulum and zip-lining. These activities cost between Sh500 and Sh1,000.I wondered how it would feel to do a Tarzan swing over the water. Then I thought of how I could easily break my coccyx.I stood there instead, marvelling at the beauty, took countless photos and we moved along. Part of the nature trail traverses over the river on an exhilarating canopy walk, 30 metres from the ground. The walk on this wooden path is only for the lion-hearted.However, you have to choose between fear or missing out on the view of the slow-moving river, forest, and falls from up here, which is gorgeous. Surprisingly, it is also calming and reassuring once you have made it to the very end. If the canopy walk does not tickle your fancy, you can spend time exploring the natural caves.Our walk ends at the forest's main camping site, which is ideal for hosting families, couples or solo travellers. One can choose to camp on the ground or by the river. The camp-sites were born out of a participatory management plan between the community and the KFS to cater to the growing demand of visitors who seek to stay longer in the serene, green and beautiful environment. Camping fees are Sh1,500 per person.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ground camping site at Camp Ndunda Falls, Njukiri Forest, Embu County. PHOTO | POOLFor those who do not like the idea of sleeping under a starry night, the place offers accommodation in cottages, huts and teepees. Prices range from between Sh4,500 to Sh10,000.Goat eating is a favourite pastime for most people that want to eat like our forefathers albeit for a short while.Besides the water activities, there is archery, rock climbing, and an excursion to the magnificent Mount Kenya. There is also a ground for games such as soccerLike everyone else, the pandemic has taught me that I should live more intentionally. I reignited my desire for nature, adventure, and solitude, and a day trip to Camp Ndunda was the right place to start.Nothing is less memorable than a trip that goes exactly as it was planned.\",\n",

It diversifies away from better known beach areas.'\\n\\nPaton said the island was less touristy and less well known in the UK market and would appeal to couples, including honeymooners, and families with older children.\\n\\n'People have missed out on so many occasions throughout this time and are looking for something different so Dominica will give this,' she said.\\n\\nKuoni is offering two upmarket hotels on the island: The Cabrits Resort & Spa Keminski in the Cabrits national park, which opened in 2019, and boutique clifftop resort Secret Bay, but hopes to expand to more properties in future.\\n\\nPaton added that Kuoni had earmarked the Caribbean for growth in 2022 as travel restarts to some of the islands after being put on the government's latest green list.\\n\\nOther new additions to the Caribbean programme include adults-only The House, by Elegant Resorts, in Barbados, and Ladera Resort, which boosts \\u2018open air' suites with just three walls, and the new lifestyle, adults-only property Soco Hotel, in St Lucia.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Health department secretary Brendan Murphy said in January: \\\"Even if we have a lot of the population vaccinated, we don't know whether that will prevent transmission of the virus. And it's likely that quarantine will continue for some time.\\\"\\nAustralia\\u00a0\\nDespite being deemed as \\\"safe\\\"\\u00a0for travel and granted a place on the green list by the UK Government, Australia will remain closed to the majority of international arrivals until at least the start of 2022, the Government has said.\\n\\\"We won't be seeing borders flung open at the start of next year with great ease,\\\" Finance Minister Simon Birmingham told The Australian newspaper, saying \\\"uncertainties that exist not just in the speed of the vaccine rollout but also the extent of its effectiveness to different variants of Covid, the duration of its longevity and effectiveness\\\".\\nHowever, if/when Britons are welcome, proof of a Covid-19 vaccination could be required.\\nSingapore\\nShort term visitors from anywhere in the world are not able to enter Singapore without prior permission\\nMalta\\nThere was some confusion over whether Malta was accepting the digital NHS app as proof of vaccination (in addition to the paper NHS proof), but they have now confirmed that they \\\"will accept proof of full vaccination from travellers arriving from the UK in the form of digital COVID passes, this includes the NHS app or the vaccination certificate in digital or downloaded PDF form.\\\" Fully vaccinated visitors do not need to quarantine on arrival.\\u00a0\\nThe Balearic Islands\\nThe Balearics (Mallorca, Menorca, Formentera, Ibiza) had long been a strong contender for green\\u00a0status \\u2013 and they have finally\\u00a0graduated from the amber list. This confirms Grant Shapps' decision to consider islands independently of their mainland counterparts. Visitors from the UK must present proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test.\\u00a0\\nBrunei\\nEntry to Brunei is severely restricted. Anyone seeking to enter or exit Brunei must apply for a permit from the Prime Minister's Office at least eight working days before the intended date of travel. See the Brunei Prime Minister's Office website for further information, or contact the Brunei High Commission. Brunei has announced that travellers to Brunei will need to provide a negative Covid-19 RT PCR test on arrival, obtained within 72 hours of travel. Travellers who are given permission to\\u00a0enter\\u00a0Brunei\\u00a0will need to go into quarantine on arrival at a government-designated facility (usually a local hotel).\\nFaroe Islands\\nFully vaccinated Britons can visit without the need to quarantine but will still be required to take PCR test and on day four of their trip.\\u00a0 Non-vaccinated Britons will be asked to self isolate for 10 days.\\u00a0\\nFalkland Islands\\nCurrent visitor restrictions mean tourists are not permitted to visit the Falkland Islands, including via cruise vessels. Any arrivals are expected to self-isolate for a period of 14 days.\\nSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\\nSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands has restricted access and visitor permits are required.\\nSaint Helena, Ascension & Tristan da Cunha\\nAll arrivals must have had a negative Covid-19 test result within 72 hours prior to departing for St Helena. Arrivals are subject to compulsory quarantine for 14 days. There are no other entry restrictions in force and foreign nationals are permitted to enter St Helena provided they meet the immigration rules.\\nAnguilla\\nEntry requirements in Anguilla remain strict. Only fully vaccinated travellers are allowed to enter the country. You\\u00a0must apply for permission at\\u00a0ivisitanguilla.com\\u00a0and submit a negative PCR test from a\\u00a0taken three to five days before departure.\\nAntigua and Barbuda\\nRestrictions, including testing and screening on arrival, apply to all visitors to Antigua and Barbuda regardless of vaccination status and ultimately it is the decision of the Quarantine Authority on who must self-isolate or quarantine on arrival. \\u00a0\\nBarbados\\nAccording to the FCDO: 'All travellers from the UK must present on arrival a valid Covid-19 PCR negative test result taken no more than three days in advance of your flight's arrival.' Rules then vary depending on inoculation status. If vaccinated: 'On arrival, you will undergo a rapid PCR test either at the airport or at your government-approved accommodation. You will need to remain on the premises of your accommodation and follow the quarantine rules until you receive the results of your second test. The government aims to return results within 24 hours but it is recommended that you book two nights' accommodation.' Those who are not vaccinated will be quarantined, with the requirement to wear a tracking bracelet, until they undergo a second PCR test on day five \\u2013 if negative they will be allowed out onto the island.\\u00a0\\nBermuda\\u00a0\\nAccording to the FCDO: 'Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, all visitors from a country classified by the WHO as having community transmission of Covid-19 (including the UK) will need to apply for a Bermuda Covid-19 Travel Authorisation 1 to 3 days before departure. By applying for a Travel Authorisation, visitors and residents agree to comply with Bermuda's quarantine and public health laws instructions at all times. As of 20 June 2021, all travellers who are unimmunised and arrive in Bermuda must quarantine at a designated Quarantine Hotel at their own expense for 14 days.\\n'Immunised travellers with a valid negative, pre-arrival Covid-19 PCR test result must quarantine until they receive a negative result from their arrival Covid-19 PCR test. Immunised travellers without a valid negative, pre-arrival Covid-19 test result must quarantine until they receive a negative day 4 Covid-19 test.'\\nBritish Antarctic territory\\nIf you feel so inclined to spend your holiday in the Antarctic then you may need a valid permit, which can be obtained from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office in London. Apart from that and the distance, and the harsh landscape, nothing stands in your way. \\u00a0\\nThe British Virgin Islands\\nThe British Virgin Islands are open to visitors. The FCDO explains: 'Effective 15 June, all travellers who have been fully vaccinated with the final dose administered at least 14 days before travel will not be subject to an RT-PCR test on arrival or any period of quarantine unless ordered to do so by a Quarantine Officer as a result of entry screening.' Unvaccinated travellers face mandatory testing and seven days in quarantine.\\u00a0\\nCayman Islands\\nAirports in the Cayman Islands are closed to all scheduled inbound and outbound international passenger flights until further notice.\\nDominica\\nHolidaymakers are welcome in Dominica, regardless of their vaccination status, but rules do apply. The FCDO states: 'Arriving passengers must complete an online questionnaire 24 hours before arrival, and have a PCR swab test with a negative result taken up to 72 hours before arrival. This result must be uploaded and submitted with the questionnaire so that your arrival can be approved by email from the Dominican Ministry of Health. Without this email you will not be allowed to board the flight coming into Dominica.' Further screening is carried out on arrival;\\u00a0if this returns a positive result travellers will have to quarantine. \\u00a0\\nGrenada\\nGood news for vaccinated travellers heading to Grenada \\u2013 'effective from May 1 persons providing proof of full vaccination will be required to quarantine for up to 48 hours, pending a negative result from a PCR test, administered on entry, and paid in advance.' All travellers must pre-book approved accommodation for quarantine on arrival. \\u00a0\\nMontserrat\\nAll travel to or from Montserrat is via Antigua, which is now on the green list. If you are travelling to Montserrat you must comply with Antiguan entry requirements \\u2013 see above. \\u00a0\\nPitcairn Islands\\nThe borders on Pitcairn are still closed to all visitors. \\u00a0\\nTurks and Caicos Islands\\nHolidaymakers will find eased restrictions in Turks and Caicos. The FCDO explains: \\u00a0'Anyone arriving to the Turks and Caicos Islands is required to obtain pre-travel authorisation via the Turks and Caicos Islands Assured Portal.' This includes a negative test, proof of travel insurance with Covid cover and a health screen questionnaire.\\u00a0\\nWhat is the 'green watchlist'?\\nFourteen destinations now sit on the green watchlist\\u00a0\\u2013 this means that holidaymakers can still travel to them without self-isolating on their return but they are also the 'most at risk' of turning amber and having quarantine re-imposed. Portugal was given five days' notice between being moved from the watchlist\\u00a0to the amber list.\\nSee the full list amber list, which includes most of Europe, the Caribbean and the USA.\\nThe 56\\u00a0hotel quarantine red list countries are:\\n\\nIndia\\nSouth Africa\\nDR Congo\\nTanzania\\nZimbabwe\\nBotswana\\nEswatini\\nZambia\\nMalawi\\nNamibia\\nLesotho\\nMozambique\\nAngola\\nRwanda\\nBurundi\\nSomalia\\nEthiopia\\nUnited\\u00a0Arab Emirates (including Dubai)\\nOman\\nSeychelles\\nQatar\\nPanama\\nCape Verde\\nArgentina\\nBrazil\\nBolivia\\nChile\\nColombia\\nEcuador\\nFrench Guiana\\nGuyana\\nParaguay\\nPeru\\nSuriname\\nUruguay\\nVenezuela\\nThe Philippines\\nPakistan\\nKenya\\nBangladesh\\nNepal\\nMaldives\\nTurkey\\nEgypt\\nSri Lanka\\nCosta Rica\\nBahrain\\nSudan\\nTrinidad and Tobago\\nAfghanistan\\nUganda\\nTunisia\\nEritrea\\nHaiti\\nDominican Republic\\nMongolia\",\n",

Photo / Getty ImagesThis weekend 1000 Italian football fans will travel to Wembley to watch the 2021 Euro Cup final in England.Normally these travellers would be required to spend 10 days in isolation, but in a sporting gesture the UK has agreed to allow these tourists to bypass quarantine to watch the historic match. Providing they spend no longer than 12 hours in the country, and use dedicated transport to get to the match, they are free to cheer on their team at Wembley.Quite a relief, considering they will have paid over $1000 (\\u20ac610) each for a ticket.The coronavirus pandemic has meant that the soccer tournament is the largest on the world stage. 26.3 million people tuned in to watch Denmark's game against England on Wednesday.It's the kind of excitement that's hard to ignore, even in New Zealand.Now the Beautiful Game will be played in what is of possibly the world's first football travel bubble.Beyond the fever pitch and chants of \\\"Forza Azzurri\\\" and \\\"In-ger-land\\\", there is a more important competition:Which country makes for the better holiday destination?England vs ItalyPre-pandemic Italy accounted for 2.2 million tourists to the UK a year. It was the sixth biggest by visitors and spending, dropping $2billion on holidays to the British Isles.However 3.5 million Brits - around 3 million of whom were 'Inglese', to be precise. Looking at the total international visitor numbers, it is more clear cut.Scores on the doors for total international visitors in 2019: England 40 million, Italy 92 million.England as a holiday destination is not for everyone.On matters of food and weather, it's hardly a fair match. However, there are some big draw cards for Italians - beyond Wembley.According to Visit Britain the second most sought-after experiences for Italian holiday makers is to take a narrow boat tour of the canals of England.Surprisingly, the Digbeth waterways are more popular with Italian tourists the Canale Grande in Venice.Pop culture is also the UK's secret weapon. Italians are 14 per cent more interest in seeing the castle where Harry and Meghan got married. Harry Potter is also a big draw, as well as a Beatles tour of Liverpool.Almost half - 49 per cent - of visits by Italian tourists are to London. No doubt that'll be where the attention of most Italians will be come Kick off on Sunday Night.Three quarters of Italian visitors plan to return, and with only 12 hours to explore they'll probably be back for more.\",\n",

Picture: APShare this article:By Julie GordonOTTAWA - Foreign tourists who are not vaccinated against Covid-19 will not be allowed to enter Canada for quite some time because the government is unwilling to jeopardize progress made on containing the virus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday.\\\"I can tell you right now that's not going to happen for quite a while,\\\" said Trudeau, when asked by reporters when Canada would allow unvaccinated tourists to enter the country.Canada, as of this week, has waived quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated citizens. But non-essential foreign travellers are still not allowed to enter despite pressure from the country's hurting tourism sector.The United States does not have vaccine requirements for visitors. At this point talks about lifting border restrictions are focused on fully vaccinated travellers, Trudeau said.\\\"The next step we'll be looking at what measures we can allow for international travellers who are fully vaccinated,\\\" he said. \\\"We will have more to say in the coming weeks.\\\"Trudeau has previously said authorities are looking closely at domestic vaccination rates, the spread of variants of concern, and how the rest of the world deals with Covid-19.About 78% of people aged 12 years or older in Canada have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, health officials said on Thursday. About 44% of people 12 years or older are fully vaccinated.Governments in Canada and the United States have faced pressure to reopen the world's largest land border, which has been shuttered to non-essential travel since March 2020. The current restrictions are in place at least until July 21.A White House official told Reuters on Wednesday that are opening of US borders to many global tourists will still need more discussion.Trending on IOL#thirdwave#EURO2020#JacobZuma\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Booking your next vacation at a family-friendly resort might just be the best thing you can do to help insure you get the most out of your time away. This is true even if you're a solo traveler, venturing out with your friends, or a couple with no children. Why would a family resort be an option you should consider? Here are 10 reasons why it could be one of the smartest choices you can make. 1. A wider variety of activities on-property \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Sharon Rigney Activities are plentiful at Club Med Punta Cana\\n\\n Many resorts offer a variety of curated activities and events on-property. Crowd-pleasers at some places include scavenger hunts, bakery wars, Olympic games, bingo, fitness classes, hayrides, archery tag, themed games, pool games, bar games, bumper boats, a climbing wall, paintball adventures, circus activities, escape rooms, forest bathing and wine tasting. You can even learn something new, and since many are catered to beginners, you shouldn't feel embarrassed to try. 2. More choices in food and beverages \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Sharon Rigney Dining in style at Grand Residences, Riviera Maya\\n\\n Many smaller boutique and rental properties simply cannot compete in this area. Enter the family resort, where you may get in-room kitchens or condos with full kitchen setups. Some offer restaurants that are casual, some that are more upscale, some that have more of a pub feel, breakfast options, a market for quick grab-and-go options, boxed lunches and room service, as well as food service by the pool. Having many options lets you pick the one that best works for you. 3. More settings on site to mix up your leisure time \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Sharon Rigney Lots to do at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort\\n\\n Ever go to a small hotel and get stuck at the same pool for days at a time? Family resorts excel at providing a variety of places you can chill. Want to relax by the pool? You can. Want to hit the beach for a bit? You can. Want to find a pretty spot to take pictures? You can. Love a fire pit and roasting marshmallows? Score. Tennis or golf anyone? Game on. Need some wellness options? They probably have them. 4. Better organized activities off-site \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Sharon Rigney Kayaking near Topnotch Resort in Vermont\\n\\n Once you've spent some time at the resort, you may want to venture into the nearby town. Larger resorts know this might be on your list of wants, so many have sourced the most popular things to do in their area, found the best places to enjoy these activities and have made it easy for you to get there and back, sometimes with a guide. No more researching and organizing on your own \\u2013 you simply book and go. 5. A larger variety of room options \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Sharon Rigney Accommodation options abound at Keystone Resort in Colorado\\n\\n Resorts like to be able to offer the accommodations that families find most convenient, which sometimes mean adjoining or connecting rooms, rooms away from noise or rooms near the pool. Should you and another couple be traveling together and need or want to take advantage of any of the options they offer, you're able to. 6. Private adults-only areas to enjoy peace and quiet \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Sharon Rigney Sunset by the Tranquility Pool at Hawks Cay Resort in Florida\\n\\n Kids are great, but sometimes you want time away. Even family resorts understand this, and many times will have private areas to regroup and enjoy things sans kiddos. Spend time by the adults-only pool, take an early morning yoga class, book a room in the no-kids-zone or visit the spa for some grown-up time to yourself. 7. The ability to purchase all of your vacation needs in one place \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Sharon Rigney Getting right to the fun at Camelback Mountain Resort in Pennsylvania\\n\\n At larger family resorts, you're able to buy things like your lift tickets, ski lessons, lodging and rentals all in one place, thereby simplifying your visit. No need to spend half the day gathering what you need to start enjoying your time away. Simply dive into the fun. 8. It's often more affordable \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Sharon Rigney A lot is included in your stay at Blue Harbor Resort in Wisconsin\\n\\n Vacations can be expensive. Larger resorts often make it more affordable for visitors by grouping things together and allowing you to purchase everything as a package. All-inclusives are great at this. Rather than booking everything on your own, a family resort might make your trip more affordable, even if you're kid-free. 9. It can be more social \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Bueneventura Golf & Beach Resort Who will you meet by the water at Buenaventura Golf & Beach Resort in Panama?\\n\\n Ever visit a smaller hotel or adults-only place to find that it's all couples who don't really want to meet anyone else? If you tend to be more social, are traveling with friends or just like the option of meeting friendly faces, a family resort can often fit the bill. Many are filled with folks just like you who wouldn't mind chatting it up a bit by the water or at the swim-up bar. 10. Optional convenient transport to and from the airport \\n \\n\\n \\u00a9 Sharon Rigney Getting around easily at Rosewood Tucker's Point, Bermuda\\n\\n Why stress about how you're going to get to the resort? Are there taxis? Is there a rideshare service you can use? Is it close enough to walk? A family resort knows their clientele want the ease of getting to the resort quickly, efficiently and safely. You get the benefit of being able to get to your room faster and more easily. 10Best is a part of the USA TODAY Network, providing an authentically local point of view on destinations around the world, in addition to travel and lifestyle advice. \\nContinue Reading \\nShow full articles without \\\"Continue Reading\\\" button for {0} hours.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"\\u00a9 Provided by Tyler-Longview KTRE There is less than a one day supply of several types of blood at Carter Blood Care's donation center in Tyler\\n\\n\\nTYLER, Texas (KLTV) - Carter Blood Care says they're facing a critical shortage of blood \\u2212 one not seen in the last 30 years.At their donation center in Tyler, the shelves, which are supposed to be filled with their blood supply, are mostly empty. Manager of Operations Jacque Decker says COVID-19 is primarily to blame for the shortage.'Blood drives had to be canceled; we had a lot less donor turnout at our blood drives and our donor centers,' Decker said.Another contributor to their supply is donations from blood drives at local high schools. But since school is out, those drives aren't happening, making the shortage even worse.'There are certain blood types that we have less than a one-day supply of and sometimes the blood is going out the very next day, just as quick as we can get it in,' Decker said.When it comes time for the blood to be used, Decker says East Texas hospitals are feeling the impact of the shortage.'There are patients all across DFW, Central, and East Texas that are being told they're having to wait right now,' Decker said.We reached out to East Texas hospitals about how they're handling the shortage.UT Health East Texas says in part, 'We have experienced intermittent shortages in blood supply dating back to February's winter storm. At times, the shortages are more severe, as they have been recently. However, we monitor our supply daily, and to date, have not experienced any negative impact.'CHRISTUS Health did not return our request for comment.It's not known when the shortage could end, but in the meantime, Carter Blood Care urges everyone eligible to donate.'We do a quick mini-physical and you answer a couple of questions, and we'll have you in and out in about 30 to 45 minutes, and you'll get some juice and cookies,' Decker said.Anyone who has had COVID-19 must wait 14 days after their last symptoms before donating blood. There is no wait time after getting a COVID-19 vaccine.For more information on how you can donate blood, click here.Copyright 2021 KLTV.

      "      \"summary\": \"When I'm on a sleeper train I can barely sleep, such is my state of expectation. Everything, from the handsome ticket to the unsociable departure time to the identity of other passengers, is liable to induce excitement.Once in the cosy, linen-provisioned room, the door closed, there's the sound of furtive passengers in the corridor, preparations and salutations, a drinks trolley. I'm sometimes torn between sitting down for a meal in the dining car or eating in my compartment.That we might revive the fine art of overnight train travel could be one of the best legacies of the pandemicAnother important choice comes at bedtime: to draw the blind or not. Do I want night skies and bright stations, or the inky-black privacy of my moving cell? The lexicon of night trains is a lulling Kraftwerk lyric: wagon-lit, couchette, Trans Euro Nacht, Orient Express, Schlafwagen. Then there's the therum-thererum, of iron wheels passing over fishplates \\u2013 precisely the rhythm of a rocking crib.So the announcement last week that the excellently named French startup Midnight Trains is going to relaunch sleeper services from 12 cities from 2024 is the best travel news I've heard in ages. Europe's once-dreamy network of night trains \\u2013 which lasted from the 19th century to the 1980s \\u2013 has been dwindling in recent decades, thanks to high operational costs, privatisation and the rise of the five-quid flight. That we might revive the fine art of overnight train travel could be one of the best legacies of the pandemic. A slower, greener, safer form of travel simply does not exist. Everything (almost) about sleeper trains is beautiful.Passengers in a sleeper car of the Paris-Nice night train, which returned to service in May. Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesI don't think I can remember more than three flights out of the scores I've taken. But I remember every sleeper train journey. My first taste was during a couple of Interrails in the 1980s, when I used night services to save on hotels and to cover long distances. I was a travel virgin, and notching up capital cities, and rail terminuses, was a big deal for me. I didn't have the money for upgrades, so travelled in seated carriages or shared with strangers as well as my travel companion \\u2013 a friend on my first month-long grand tour, a girlfriend on the subsequent one.Each journey brought me small epiphanies. Sleepers often slow down at night for maintenance on the line: at one long hiatus on a Madrid-Rome train, I pushed down the window to look out over the French Riviera from a high vantage point. The sultry night came in, a million white lights flickering over the bay of Cannes, or Nice, or Monaco.Stations become pilgrimage sites. Bidding farewell to the train is heartbreakingOn a last-minute winter break, a sleeper from Tangier to Marrakech allowed me and two friends to dump the package hotel we'd booked and swap a hashish-blurred French-feeling city for a more Arab one. The journey took us through Casablanca, which is not much of a tourist destination despite the film. I peeked out in the small hours to see industrial estates and suburban sprawl. I wasn't disappointed. I wasn't staying there.On an Interrail I took when I turned 50, there weren't many sleeper services available and almost none on the route I wanted to follow. But I did get a single compartment from Berlin to Vienna. It was a Czech-run train, and I was served Hungarian goulash in my compartment. I slept little, as I had taken a journey in the opposite direction 30 years earlier and, as we approached Prague, I looked out to see the city. I recognised nothing, but the memories rolled all night.The end of a sleeper journey is nothing like a normal arrival. The sewery pong of Paris, the musical notes of the tannoy in Amsterdam, meeting lines of commuters at Berlin Hauptbahnhof \\u2026 the most banal things seem momentous. The night train traveller lives against the grain, on another clock. Stations become pilgrimage sites. Bidding farewell to the train is heartbreaking.The Caledonian Sleeper crossing Rannoch Moor, on the way to Fort William. Photograph: Phil Wills/AlamyWhat a great European invention! Except it's not. As early as 1837, first-class passengers on some trains between London and the north-west of England were invited to rest on makeshift beds made from webbing strung between the seats. Queen Adelaide had a private sleeping car adapted from this model.When I've taken Euston sleepers, the memorable aspects were malt whiskies \\u2026 and the wonder of waking to the HighlandsIn 1865, George Pullman launched his luxury Pioneer sleeping carriage \\u2013 with upper and lower berths \\u2013 in the US. On this side of the Atlantic, the first true sleeper carriage was operated by the North British Railway on the east coast line between King's Cross and Glasgow in 1873.Just before lockdown, the Caledonia Sleeper launched new bedrooms on its London to Scotland services. They look a bit corporate to me, to be honest, but interior d\\u00e9cor was never the draw on those journeys. When I've taken sleepers from Euston, the memorable aspects were malt whiskies, chats with Munro baggers, haggis dinners (probably microwaved, but haggis always tastes great) and, above all, the wonder of waking to the russets and purples of the Highlands.Sadly, London to Fort William for two currently costs \\u00a3865 return, so you'd have to be a Queen Adelaide (or a Scottish MP, perhaps) to use the Cally. That's the major 'almost' qualifier in my perfect picture of sleepers. Let's hope Midnight Trains can keep its prices competitive in the interests of common people \\u2013 and the planet!\",\n",

Federal officials called this a \\\"first phase\\\" of reopening given the pace of vaccination in Canada.In order to avoid going into quarantine, travelers must provide proof of full vaccination at least 14 days prior to travel and a negative Covid-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of entering Canada.All those entering will be required to self-isolate at home until the results of their Covid-19 test comes back negative.Canada's Covid-19 case count has been dropping steadily and vaccinations have been ramping up, with nearly 70% of Canadians having received at least one dose.

      "      \"summary\": \"As\\u00a0soon as Himachal opened its borders, a few people started coming in to visit. But when the government announced that no RTPCR test or E-Pass was required any longer, so many people just packed their bags and ran towards the hill state. But at Meenabagh, RT-PCR test is mandatory, because this property is around a residential area,' notes Sanjay Austa, Owner, Meenabagh Homes, with a property in Shimla and Ratnari. As the summers are getting harsher in Delhi, Punjab and other adjoining Northern states, coupled with the newfound freedom from the second wave and resultant lockdowns has led to the trend of \\u2018revenge travel'. It is why many have been flocking to the hills, and even flouting important Covid- 19 norms. As evident from a recent video that went viral of a beggar kid in Dharamshala asking people to wear their masks. However, this \\u2018herd mentality' is ringing in cash registers of homestays and hotels of domestic hotspots. \\nScenes from homestays Meenabagh in Ratnari\\n 'May is the \\u2018season time', but we were under lockdown then. However, now we will be able to make up for the losses, as people are coming in with their kids, the elderly and even pets. We are fully packed till August 15,' explains Austa. Apart from home stays, even the hotels in Shimla are fully packed on weekends. Vivek Sharma, Front Office Associate, Sanobar The Grand White Shimla, says, 'Our 70-room property is fully packed on weekends, and at least 25-30 rooms are occupied on weekdays. Every week, we host 700- 1,000 guests. The condition here is so bad. Sometimes, guests don't get rooms and end up sleeping in their cars! We have had to say no to walk-in guests as all the rooms are occupied.' The property started operations on June 15 and RT-PCR is not mandatory for hotel guests. However, online booking is to help hotels and homestays accommodate guests and any of their requirements in advance. Treehouse Properties gets corporate travellers on weekdays and leisure guests over the weekends. 'Most of our hotels, including Chail Villas near Shimla, except Goa, are getting a lot of families for weekend breaks, and many weddings ceremonies at our various properties. It's a mixed crowd, with honeymooners and leisure travellers in the same properties,' Jayant Singh, Founder & MD, Treehouse Hotels. The importance of RT-PCR tests\\nOn one hand, the restrictions are equal to nil in Himachal; on the other hand, a negative RTPCR report and E-pass are mandatory to enter the other hill state Uttarakhand. Prashant Pandey, Manager, Imperial heights, Binsar, Uttarakhand, says, 'Our staff and the local police ensure that social distancing measures are in place and people don't break the laws.' The hotel that started its operations from June gets most of its guests from Bareilly and Delhi. 'Out of our 20 rooms, 12-13 rooms mostly get occupied towards the weekends. Business has started picking up now,' says Pandey. Priya Vajpai, who along with her husband, owns and runs Vaikunth Homestay in Natadol, Uttarakhand, has entertained six families ever since tourist entry was allowed into the state, and prefers to run it in a home- l ike envi ronment . 'Guests are a part of the whole process that we follow here to live. I don't take bookings just like that. Before the guests book, I tell them this space is for solitude, and I filter requests depending upon what they need,' says Vajpai, adding she makes it a point to get the RTPCR report and vaccination certificates from the guests in advance for their safety. 'We get the Covid tests and all the paperwork done in advance, so guests don't have to wear masks. Even if the government lifts the test requirement, I will continue to ask for it.' Guests preferring longer stays, head to serviced apartments, like the ones run by The Manor in Naldehra, but have to abide by the Covid protocol. Jatin Bansal, Resident Manager, The Manor, informs, 'Ours is a township comprising 75 apartments. Of these, we operate/ rent seven on our own and the rest are owned by people. Most of the tourists coming in are from Gurugram and Delhi. As this is a township, we have a clinic with doctors and nurses available on call. We have antigen test kits, so doing an RTPCR test beforehand is not necessary. If anyone gets a fever, we immediately test and isolate them. But, you cannot roam without masks and have to follow social distancing norms. We mainly entertain families, so people who wish to stay and work from here need to get a reference letter from their office.' Guests at Meenabagh are not required to wear masks as the property is already isolated and they don't have to go anywhere outside. 'But in Shimla, you can see people roaming around without masks. I feel the government shouldn't have relaxed the RTPCR norm. That would have had only responsible tourists enter the state,' says Austa.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Hello, Stranger. By Will Buckingham. Granta; 336 pages; \\u00a316.99The Power of Strangers. By Joe Keohane. Random House; 352 pages; $28. Viking; \\u00a316.99Fractured. By Jon Yates. Harper North; 348 pages; $28.99 and \\u00a320ATTITUDES TO STRANGERS tend to follow a familiar pattern. Children are taught never to speak to unknown grown-ups, especially those regarded by their parents as untrustworthy. The onset of adolescence and young adulthood brings a bursting desire to interact with all sorts of people, particularly the kind who might not elicit family approval. Whether the resulting encounters are sexual or social, they confer a thrilling frisson of escape.Social circles generally narrow again as people find life-partners, form households and produce offspring of their own. Time becomes scarce; new friendships are often based on sharing the burden of child care. Some people never recover the youthful zest for unforeseen liaisons. Professional duties swell even as parental ones diminish, and the inclination sags. In old age, even if curiosity and charisma remain undimmed, frailty makes new serendipitous connections harder to establish.But that is not the whole story. In mid-life and beyond people can still experience the joy of a random meeting, however short, which somehow touches a nerve. That might involve nothing more than a smile, or a chance remark that hits an emotional spot; or it might be an unexpectedly deep conversation on a plane or train, a surge of mutual understanding that is life-affirming even if the interlocutor is never seen again. This aspect of the promise and peril of strangers has enticed storytellers\\u2014from the rapture of 'Brief Encounter' and 'Before Sunrise' to the ruin of 'Strangers on a Train'. The knowledge that the exchange will be a one-off can permit a delicious, uninhibited frankness.In the age of covid-19 and Zoom, the chronological pattern has been warped. Instead of their hazy possibilities and risks, strangers have assumed an all-too-literal role as a looming source of infection. During lockdowns they are officially to be avoided. Yet youngsters still long, dangerously, for the ecstasy of communion, not just with edgy individuals but anonymous crowds. People of all ages have come to miss the human stimulation of busy high streets or trains, or the comforting sense of fellowship in a cinema or theatre audience.So this is an apt moment for three books about meeting strangers. Will Buckingham has written a moving memoir of finding solace, after the death of his life-partner, in travelling and talking in lands such as Myanmar that are culturally distant from his native England. Joe Keohane, an American journalist, argues that communicating empathetically with strangers is vital and potentially life-changing. Jon Yates, who runs a youth charity based in London, frets that deep fissures in Western societies are making it impossible for people to reach, even casually, between classes, religions, ethnicities and generations.All three authors make sweeping generalisations about the evolution of human society, from hunter-gatherers to the age of Homer and beyond. But they are more interesting when they reflect, using personal experience or scientific research, on how people live and communicate now. In different ways, they all make two separate but related points. First, interacting meaningfully with a new person can bring huge rewards\\u2014but it is a skill that must be cultivated and can easily be lost. Second, the self-segregation of modern Western societies means that, for many people, conversing with some fellow citizens seems pointless, undesirable or outlandish. The second problem exacerbates the first: if you consider others beyond the pale, why make the effort to get to know them?As both Mr Keohane and Mr Yates emphasise, in Britain and America political divisions have ossified into tribal ones. Supporters and opponents of Brexit live in discrete clusters; Republicans and Democrats see each other as bad people, not fellow Americans whose opinions happen to differ. These opposing sides have become strangers to one another. Mr Buckingham focuses on the pleasures and pitfalls of encounters in remote places where the stakes are lower because the acquaintanceships are bound to be temporary\\u2014in a holiday flat-share in Helsinki or while travelling through the Balkans. But, like the other two, he notes that wariness of unfamiliar people is neither new nor insuperable.Faces look ugly when you're aloneMr Keohane and Mr Yates offer tips on befriending strangers. Mr Keohane describes exercises in which groups of Republicans and Democrats were, with great difficulty, coaxed to overcome stereotypes and see one another as rounded individuals. They were trained to ask each other good questions and avoid name-calling. Mr Yates discusses the case for a kind of national social service that would encourage youngsters to mix with other groups and generations. Both have homely micro-solutions that readers can apply in daily relations\\u2014assume the best of others, remember that most have stories they are longing to tell, react philosophically when a friendly approach is rebuffed.A telling point that none of the books captures is a paradoxical one: some of the most sophisticated forms of interaction between strangers occur in societies that are chronically divided. Think, for example, of rural Northern Ireland, or of parts of the former Ottoman Empire, such as Lebanon, where residents have lived in separate communal silos. In ways impenetrable to outsiders, the denizens of such places develop perfect antennae for the affiliation of a stranger and adjust their remarks accordingly. The ensuing exchanges occur within well-understood parameters\\u2014including a sense that social categories are resilient and pleasantries will not change them. But tact allows people from antagonistic camps to have amicable encounters and transactions.All three authors are inclined to overstate the ability of brief interactions to stave off conflict. Yet at least this much is true: a capacity to engage with new people in civilised, humane and meaningful ways is a necessary condition for social peace, even if it is not a sufficient one. That points up a half-hidden cost of covid-19. Children educated on screen; teenagers bouncing off the walls; adults working at home; lonely pensioners: more or less everyone's social skills have been atrophying, with consequences not only for individuals but, perhaps, for the fabric of society.As lockdowns lift, people are now stumbling back into a world of accidental collisions, some eagerly, some queasily, most with an odd sensation of novelty after a year of hibernation. The lesson of these books is that the easing of restrictions is not just a coveted opportunity to reconnect with those you love and resemble. It also restores a freedom, long taken for granted even if little used, to come to know the profoundly different. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Books & arts section of the print edition under the headline \\\"The comfort of strangers\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Jul 10th 2021SAN SEBASTI\\u00c1NON A ROCKY outcrop overlooking a Norwegian fjord she created a wall of aluminium leaves, making each of their gently curved shapes distinct. At the outdoor sculpture park of the Inhotim museum in southern Brazil she built a magical labyrinth lined with replica vegetation. In Baja California she fashioned a delicate sculptural monument that sits on the ocean floor, 14 metres beneath the surface. Fish swim in and out of the lettering she carved through the reinforced concrete. The only way to see the work, a tribute to marine preservation, is by scuba-diving.Much of Cristina Iglesias's art has been commissioned as public monuments for specific sites. She spends months, sometimes years, honing the individual character of each piece\\u2014yet they are all connected. She often draws inspiration from the fragile relationship between humanity and the natural world. She mixes the real with the imagined, the seen with the remembered. Typically, she took a long time to decide what she wanted to make for her home town by the sea, which she left at 18 but never forgot.The city of San Sebasti\\u00e1n in the Basque country of Spain had asked her several times for a sculpture; the initial request came in 1998, when Ms Iglesias put on an exhibition at the nearby Guggenheim Bilbao. Conscious that San Sebasti\\u00e1n already boasted monumental pieces by Jorge Oteiza and Eduardo Chillida, two 20th-century Basque masters, as well as numerous religious statues that stand in the hills overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, she wanted to do something different.And then it came to her. In the middle of the bay, around which San Sebasti\\u00e1n hugs the ocean, is a small island called Santa Clara. No more than a few hundred metres from the shore, it is nonetheless remote from the daily rhythms of the city, observes Ms Iglesias's longtime collaborator James Lingwood of Artangel, an art-promoting charity. In bygone times this was where victims of the plague were taken to die. Over the decades a small lighthouse flashed out both a warning and a welcome.As a child Ms Iglesias used to gaze at it as she fished from the mainland. 'Santa Clara was always part of the landscape for us,' she says; at 16 she swam across to the island with her brothers. But none of them had ever been inside the lighthouse. Creating an artwork within the building, which had been derelict since the mid-1960s, would, she decided, be her gift to the city.The journey there is part of the experience. Visitors step into a small boat to cross the glassy sea. The shrieks of gulls fill the air. A narrow stone track curves up the hill, enclosed on both sides by ash trees, laurel, tamarisk and Japanese pittosporum. It is not until you reach the clearing near the top that you see the square lighthouse that has guarded the bay since the middle of the 19th century. When you open the door you are confronted by Ms Iglesias's creation.Creatures of the deepAfter that, it is hard to look away. From a narrow platform just inside the entrance you gaze down at an undulating floor, cast in bronze but with the shape and texture of rock. Every few minutes the sea pounds in, flinging spray into the air before receding into the depths. There is something mesmerising about watching the water emerge, withdraw and return, a sensation intensified by the changing sight and sound of the sculpture as you follow the platform that snakes along the interior wall to consider it from new angles.Learning how the extraordinary work was made enhances its theatrical power. Ms Iglesias's team excavated a nine-metre hole in the rock beneath the lighthouse, then installed a hydraulic system through which the sea-spray is pumped up onto the bronze rock. The floor itself, curved to convey the eroded layers of sediment that emerge from the sea around the island\\u2014'the Earth's ribs', as Ms Iglesias calls them\\u2014was cast in a foundry and slowly winched into place from a helicopter. It was 'one of the biggest challenges of my career', says Hugo Corres, the structural engineer behind the project.The result is a feeling of something, or everything, being swallowed and carried away to the void. It echoes the human peril in the story of Jonah and the whale, at the same time hinting at the vulnerability of marine animals. Ms Iglesias wanted the sculpture to have a name that would bring out what Mr Lingwood calls its 'dark enchantment'. She enlisted the help of Be\\u00f1at Sarasola, a young poet who, using an etymological dictionary, discovered an old Basque word he hadn't known before: 'Hondalea', which roughly translates as 'marine abyss'. 'As soon as I heard it,' the artist says, 'I knew it was perfect.'Among her muses is Rachel Carson, an influential American conservationist who called the seashore 'a place of unrest'. Carson's book, 'The Rocky Coast', which Ms Iglesias read and reread while she worked on 'Hondalea', ends with the writer standing on a rock, thinking about the place where the deep time of geology meets the twice-daily movement of the tides, advancing and receding, covering and revealing. Ms Iglesias's sculpture captures the same mood of transience and eternity, peril and fate. It grips your senses on the island and, back on the mainland, swirls and swells in your memory. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Books & arts section of the print edition under the headline \\\"To the lighthouse\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"The Invention of Sicily. By Jamie Mackay. Verso; 304 pages; $24.95 and \\u00a316.99SICILY BEGUILES. It offers coves with limpid water; Greek temples, such as those at Agrigento and Segesta, that are among the best preserved in the Mediterranean; a Roman amphitheatre at Taormina still used for its original dramatic purpose; grandiose Baroque palazzi; bustling street markets; some of the best food to be had in Italy; an expanding range of fine wines at reasonable prices; and a cathedral in Palermo that is a riot of eclecticism. Etna on a spring morning, still capped with snow and belching smoke, is among Europe's greatest sights.The ancient Greeks saw Sicily as rich and fertile yet 'dangerous and unpredictable'. For Jamie Mackay, author of this brief and pacey history of the island, their perception reflected a dual view of Sicily that would be expressed in different forms up to the present day. In Mr Mackay's telling, a tipping-point arrived at the dawn of the 14th century after several hundred years of relatively enlightened rule by Byzantine Greeks, Arabs and Normans. The uprising that came to be known as the Sicilian Vespers sparked a war that led to the expulsion of the island's French rulers. But it is only too characteristic of Sicily's ill fortune that this popular victory should ultimately have had such dismal effects.Sovereignty over an ethnically and religiously diverse island passed, via the rulers of Aragon and Catalonia, to those of a newly unified Spain, obsessed with confessional uniformity and, by implication, racial purity. Sicily became an outlying territory in an empire that favoured traditional social arrangements and a profoundly conservative form of Catholicism. For almost 400 years, Mr Mackay notes, Sicily had been governed by an urban elite in Palermo. 'Following the Vespers, though, power moved progressively away from these individuals, and into the hands of rural landowners and church authorities.'A strand of popular heterodoxy endured, half-surfacing as superstition, the secret worship of polytheistic deities and even the practice of magic. But among the results of Sicily's incorporation into the Spanish Empire was that it was barely affected by Renaissance humanism. Being part of the empire did, however, shield it from the worst effects of the decline in Mediterranean trade prompted by the colonisation of the Americas. And, after Sicily became part of the Kingdom of Naples, it got a whiff of the Enlightenment, thanks to the Bourbon monarch who would become Charles III of Spain. A second apparent liberation, by Giuseppe Garibaldi and a small army of Italian nationalists, again turned sour: Italy's new, Piedmontese rulers bungled the peace that followed, and Sicily's nascent Mafia exploited the chaos.Mr Mackay is at his best when he weaves concise descriptions of customs, social changes, legends and cultural glories through this tumultuous narrative. Artistically, Sicily's historical relationship with the Italian mainland bears some similarity to Ireland's with Britain: an island with a disproportionately small middle class, sandwiched between a vast, uneducated peasantry and a landowning aristocracy largely indifferent to culture, which nevertheless produced a string of literary, artistic and musical giants. Vincenzo Bellini, Giovanni Verga, Luigi Pirandello, Leonardo Sciascia, Renato Guttuso, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa and, most recently, Andrea Camilleri, were all Sicilians.The author is at his worst when he fails to check his facts and verify his assertions. He appears to take as historically reliable the legendary founding date of Rome, describes the Benedictines and Jesuits as 'sects' and makes Oscar Luigi Scalfaro prime minister of Italy, a post Mr Scalfaro never held. These are unfortunate missteps in an enjoyable canter across a history, and a place, which are entrancing and disturbing by turns. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Books & arts section of the print edition under the headline \\\"Under the volcano\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

Penguin Business; \\u00a320AT THE HEIGHT of his success, Arif Naqvi liked to remind colleagues that 'Today's peacock is tomorrow's feather duster.' That ended up being an apt description of his own fate. As head of the Abraaj Group, the Pakistan-born financier spread his wings and attracted billions of dollars from global investors, only to end up being plucked by prosecutors as the alleged perpetrator of one of the largest corporate frauds in history\\u2014charges he denies.Abraaj never became a household name. In its heyday in the mid-2010s, however, it claimed to be the world's largest private-equity group focused on emerging markets. Within a decade of founding the firm in 2002, Mr Naqvi had earned a reputation as a swashbuckling empire-builder, propelled by cheeky deals and a talent for self-promotion; he was one of Davos's keenest flesh-pressers. He burnished his image with bursts of philanthropy. At one point he was even tipped as a future prime minister of Pakistan.For the investors needed to plump up Abraaj's private-equity funds, the biggest attraction was that Mr Naqvi seemed to be a master of 'impact investing', according to 'The Key Man', an account of his rise and fall by Simon Clark and Will Louch of the Wall Street Journal. This more caring form of capitalism, which involves trying to make a profit and do good at the same time, was right for the era. Mr Naqvi 'was sought out by billionaires and their millennial heirs who enthusiastically adopted the idea of impact investing and the feel-good veneer it gave to the old game of making money'. Among those who invested in Abraaj's funds were the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and Western and Middle Eastern governments.Academics and journalists lapped it up, too. A prominent Harvard professor became a cheerleader for Abraaj. Institutional Investor, an industry publication, crowned Mr Naqvi 'The Gulf's Buy-out King'. (The firm's headquarters were in Dubai, a fitting base given the emirate's reputation as a freewheeling financial centre.)The seeds of Abraaj's downfall, say the authors, were the breakneck expansion of the business and Mr Naqvi's increasingly lavish lifestyle, which left the firm struggling to cover its costs, including salaries. To keep things going, Mr Naqvi and some of his lieutenants allegedly started to sweep more and more of the available cash in Abraaj's funds into secret bank accounts that they controlled, thereby breaking a cardinal rule of asset management: that investors' funds should never be commingled with the firm's own money. The more investors' cash was diverted in this way, says the book, the more elaborate was the extra financial juggling required to make it look to them and the rest of the outside world as if nothing was awry. The strain appears to have pushed Mr Naqvi's finance chief, a pious Pakistani accountant, to the edge of a nervous breakdown.The alleged jiggery-pokery began to unravel when the Gates Foundation noticed discrepancies in a health-care fund it had invested in. Whistleblowers came forward; investigations were launched. Abraaj collapsed into liquidation.American prosecutors have charged Mr Naqvi with running a criminal enterprise that 'corrupted' Abraaj between 2014 and 2018. He faces a long jail sentence if convicted. Having lost his battle against extradition, he is in effect under house arrest in London on \\u00a315m ($20.7m) bail\\u2014a British record\\u2014while he appeals. In 2019 a former senior Abraaj executive pleaded guilty in New York to fraud and racketeering. Later that year Mr Naqvi himself was convicted of fraud in the United Arab Emirates, and sentenced to three years in prison, over loans from an airline allegedly used to plug a gap in Abraaj's accounts.'The Key Man' is impeccably researched and sumptuous in its detail. But sometimes the authors are too keen to share everything they have gleaned\\u2014for instance, in pages and pages on the takeover of an electrical utility in Pakistan, or on Mr Naqvi's bail hearings. A jump back in time for a long description of the Gates Foundation's early involvement with Abraaj, just as things were getting really tense in 2016, is peculiar. The book would have been better without such diversions, at two-thirds the length.For the most part, though, it is a page-turner, built around a riveting portrait of the key man of the title. Mr Naqvi comes across as a teeming mass of contradictions: a charming and generous figure who inspired great loyalty, but was also bullying and self-important. 'He talked about his love for democracy but his employees experienced a dictatorship,' the authors conclude. He told anyone who would listen that he was on the board of Interpol, when his role was actually at a foundation linked to it. He liked to compare himself to heroes from history, real and imagined, from Moses to Sinbad.The book is also a timely reminder that it is when financial firms offer services that seem to suit the zeitgeist, and grow rapidly as a result, that scrutiny of them is most needed. The list of those too mesmerised by Abraaj's profit-with-purpose mantra to ask serious questions is uncomfortably long. With money, as with missiles, trust but verify. \\u25a0This article appeared in the Books & arts section of the print edition under the headline \\\"All that glitters\\\"Reuse this contentThe Trust Project\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Richard Marx over his career has had 14 No.1 songs as a writer \\u2013 one in each of four different decades. Photo: Handout Richard Marx likes to gently mess with the minds of whoever comes to see his solo concerts. He'll start playing a Keith Urban or a Lionel Ritchie song and look out to see the reaction. 'If it's a couple, I'll see one of them look at the other with this face like, \\u2018You're kidding me. He wrote that?'' Then hits from his career will tumble out: Right Here Waiting, Should Have Known Better, Don't Mean Nothing, Hold On To The Nights, Take This Heart, Hazard and Angelia.'And they'll go, \\u2018Oh, my God. He did that, too? Like, really? Seriously?'' says Marx. 'On my part, there's a subtle attempt to connect all the dots.' If you've not yet seen Marx in concert, he's offering a written version with his new memoir Stories To Tell, a series of anecdotes from a singer-songwriter who has rubbed shoulders with \\u2013 and supplied songs to \\u2013 music royalty. Kenny Rogers, Whitney Houston, Madonna, Barbra Streisand, Burt Bacharach, Nsync, Julio Iglesias, Josh Groban, Hugh Jackman, Kenny Loggins, Luther Vandross, Paul Anka, SheDaisy, Philip Bailey and James Ingram \\u2013 all make cameo appearances in Marx's life and career. He reveals beef with Brad Paisley, Clive Davis and Night Ranger and a crush on Olivia Newton-John. He made a Vixen song sound better with a little sonic trickery \\u2013 adding someone else's guitar solo \\u2013 and watched in horror as his band was held at gunpoint in Taipei. 'I have got so many \\u2013 somewhere between interesting and hilarious \\u2013 things that have happened in the background of my career, ' he says by phone from the Los Angeles home he shares with his wife, Daisy Fuentes. 'At the end of the day, I want people to feel the same things I want them to feel about my show - that you feel like you get to know me a little bit.'This cover image released by Simon & Schuster shows 'Stories To Tell', a memoir by Richard Marx. Photo: Handout A different phase Stories To Tell is ultimately the tale of a supremely talented, instinctual songwriter who rode the wave of MTV fame for a decade or so and then, when the heat dissipated, reinvented himself as a producer and songwriter for others. 'It was just about 10 years straight where everything I put out had success. And then I put out a record that I joked went double plywood instead of double platinum, ' he says. 'It just was like a signal that everything had shifted from me in my career. I remember thinking, \\u2018What did I do wrong?'' He says it took a year for him to grasp the change. 'I started to think, \\u2018Well, you know what? I had a really great turn for about 10 years. And it's not my turn now. It's somebody else's turn'.' He was still in his 30s and 'had a ton of music left' in him. 'I'll make it with other people, ' he concluded. That shift also freed him up to be a very present father to his three sons. Marx over his career has had 14 No.1 songs as a writer \\u2013 one in each of four different decades. He and Vandross' Dance With My Father won the 2004 Grammy for Song Of The Year. He's written or performed hits on Billboard's country, adult contemporary, mainstream rock, holiday and pop charts. Starting out as a versatile background singer, he got his big break when Lionel Richie heard a tape of his songs and invited Marx to help him with his solo albums. You can hear a teenage Marx on such hits as All Night Long and Running With The Night. That led to him writing songs with Rogers and then writing or singing for a slew of stars before the release of Marx's own 1987 self-titled debut album, which would go double platinum.Richard Marx crooning his famous hits during a free concert organised by SP Setia held at Taman Setia Tropika in Johor Baru on Feb 24, 2013. Photo: Filepic Attract and befriend superstars The book's publication is timed to the release of a two-disc companion album with remastered versions of his biggest hits plus demos, live tracks and fresh interpretations of songs he has written for other artistes. Running through the book is Marx's conviction that he has an almost mystical ability to attract and befriend superstars, something that first happened at age five when he met Davy Jones of The Monkees. As he writes: 'I've always had the ability to will people into my path.' Readers get lots of stories about Marx's collaborators and how he comes up with songs from a man who has steered clear of embarrassing, self-destructive scandal. 'He hasn't lived a life that is deserving of VH1 Behind The Music. It's been pretty even-keeled, ' said Sean Manning, his editor at Simon & Schuster. 'But I think that he is a master craftsman. That's what I was really intrigued by \\u2013 how he does what he does.' Marx in recent years has become a social media phenomenon, enchanting fans by wittily snapping back at trolls and intolerance. In June, when a guy got on Twitter to tell Marx that his pronouns should be 'has/been, ' Marx actually agreed: 'I started writing hit songs at age nineteen and the money \\u2018has been' rolling in ever since.' It was his humour, fearlessness, authenticity and self-awareness that led Manning to reach out to Marx just as the pandemic was gripping the nation. Luckily, Marx had already written some pages, based on the anecdotes he offers on stage. 'He's the first one that will make fun of himself, ' said Manning. 'He doesn't wait for anyone to do that. 'And I think that's where you do relate to him. He doesn't take himself so seriously, which I found incredibly refreshing.' Readers of Stories To Tell will find a more gentle style than his sharp-elbowed Twitter tone. He says he's a private person and was never going to write a tell-all book with incendiary details. 'On Twitter, if I'm dealing with an issue that's racist or bigoted, there's no holding back. I'm going to blast it. And if someone's coming after me, I'm going to respond as you can see, ' he says. But a book is another matter: 'They're just two completely different animals.' Marx in real life comes across as that unusual creature in the music business \\u2013 grounded, fair and happy. He's a Midwestern guy who quickly thanks his parents and people early in his life for not allowing him to come out any other way. Finally, he is asked if he could pick one thing for people to take away from the book. 'That I'm taller than they think, ' he says, laughing. 'But the answer is actually gratitude.' \\u2013 AP Join our Telegram channel to get our Evening Alerts and breaking news highlights\",\n",

Photo: AFP After researching Leonardo da Vinci's family tree, Italian scientists have identified 14 men who are descended from the artist. Their work was \\\"a synthesis of decades-long research aimed at reconstructing the complete and up-to-date genealogy of the Da Vinci family, \\\" the scientists wrote in a paper published in Human Evolution, a trade journal. Da Vinci experts Alessandro Vezzosi and Agnese Sabato said they had documented 21 generations of the artist's family. For their study, the researchers also interviewed descendants of the Italian painter, architect and engineer. They found some had pursued careers working in offices or as steel workers and craftsmen, and were now retired. The researchers also identified several families in different branches of the artist's family tree. The full history of the family now spans some 690 years. In their genealogy work, the researchers examined the male line starting from Leonardo's ancestor Michele, who was born in the 13th century, then traced his relatives, from his father Piero Frosino (1426) to the birth of the artist in 1452. They also used the documents to trace back four family branches that began with Leonardo Da Vinci's brother Domenico, according to the article. Da Vinci had at least 22 half brothers, but no children, the researchers found. - dpa\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Thai film and television series director Chalermchatri Yukol founded 'Up for Thai', a non-governmental organisation that helps prepare meals for those affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in Bangkok. Photos: Bernama In the bustling makeshift kitchen at Wat Thewa Sunthon in Bangkok, a group of volunteers is seen busy preparing food for those affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in the city. Gathering at the makeshift kitchen as early as 7am, the volunteers wearing face masks, gloves and medical caps, were busy cutting chilies and vegetables, mincing garlics, and preparing rice to be cooked. At 9am, the volunteers start cooking meals to be distributed for lunch. Every day, they prepare about 3,000 meals, both lunch and dinner, to communities impacted by Covid-19 pandemic in Bangkok. The kitchen powered by a group of hard working volunteers of all ages and walks of life provides hot meals to those whose life have been affected by the Covid-19 outbreak, so that they will not go hungry. Volunteers from 'Up For Thai' preparing meals. The volunteers work with Up For Thai, a non-governmental organisation founded by Thai film and and television director Chalermchatri Yukol. The 35-year-old Chalermchatri was tested positive for Covid-19 in April and recovered from the deadly virus, but not his close friend Kunlasub Wattnaphon who succumbed to Covid-19. Kunlasub, former e-sport player, self-isolated himself at home for five days while awaiting for an ambulance to take him to a hospital. An ambulance finally came after he shared his ordeal of waiting through Facebook livestream. Unfortunately, it was too late and he died two days later. \\\"Me and my friends were discussing why I am alive and how he (Kunlasub) died. We think if we let the government to do everything by their own, they will be overburdened. \\\"So, why not we as Thai citizens and Bangkokians lend a helping hand to help tackle some challenges the government is facing, as well as help those affected by Covid-19 or the vulnerable group, ' he said recently. Up For Thai was established in April, named after Kunlasub's nick name - Up. Since its establishment in April, the initiative has benefited an least 45 communities in Bangkok to date. \\\"When we started the initiative, we asked for donation from the public on social media. We contacted the private sector seeking cooperation. We received a good feedback. Donations have been pouring in,' Chalermchatri said. At present, he said the main makeshift kitchen at Wat Thewa Sunthon provide about 3,000 meals a day. A total of 150 volunteers on shift help to prepare meals at the main kitchen.A volunteer from 'Up For Thai' packing rice to be distributed for those affected by the Covid-19 in Bangkok. \\u2028 Besides that, he said another four smaller kitchens at temples will provide a total of 2,000 hot meals a day. \\\"We want to expand this initiative further. We will provide raw materials to these smaller kitchen where they will prepare meals to those underprivileged and needy in the communities. We plan to establish another 10 to 20 kitchens in future,' he said. At present, Chalermchatri said Up For Thai also provided raw materials to communities where 5kg rice, a tray of eggs and vegetables will be provided to a family where they can cook and eat for a week. \\\"To date, there are five communities under this initiative,' he said. Besides providing hot meals, Up For Thai also serves as a one-stop Covid-19 information centre. He said the group created communication channels on various social media platforms - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Line - as their tool of communication to provide information and consultation on Covid-19, an effort to ease government workload. \\\"We have about 150 volunteers working behind the scene. They will answer questions posted on social media, including finding ambulance and hospitals for Covid-19 patients,' he said adding that these volunteers work from home. Retiree Tassaneeya Visupakarn who joined Up For Thai said she enjoyed being part of the team. \\\"I am so grateful to be here and be part of the team. \\\"We are going through a tough time now but all volunteers here doing their best to help and contribute to the society, ' she said. For Chalermchatri, he will continue his effort at Up For Thai to reach out to people in need. \\\"It is good to see those people who we helped are helping us now. When they get back on their feet, they help to provide transportation and donate supplies. \\\"The thank you notes from kids as well as the encouragement and support from public make all the hard work and sacrifice pay off,' he said. \\u2013 Bernama Join our Telegram channel to get our Evening Alerts and breaking news highlights\",\n",

In the letter, the charming young man expressed his excitement and gratitude to his mom for going out of her way to buy him the highly coveted home video game. 'I love you mum. Thank you for buying a PS5. I know how hard it was to get. I know how much you love me and how much money you spent and I love you. I am Amir,' he wrote. In response, Amira vowed to always strive to give her children the best life can offer and not letting anything come between them. 'Coming home to such a note from my son is why I won't let nothing get in the way of giving them the best a mother can. Onions were cut here,' she wrote. Co-wife dramaSpeaking of protecting her family, the seemingly quiet mother of two recently found herself in a rather ugly situation with her co-wife, socialite Amber Ray, after she was accused of using black magic.\\u00a0 Also read: Amira, Amber Ray confront each other in SyokimauAccording to Amber, Amira tried to cast a spell on her by throwing a dead bird in her compound, a claim Amira strongly denied. During the confrontation, Amira was heard explaining that she was out for a walk when Jamal together with Amber started accusing her of leaving a dead bird in Amber's compound. Infuriated by the false claims, Amira began causing a scene whilst trying to defend herself, stating that she does not involve herself in witchcraft. Their argument quickly escalated with Amber hurling insults at Amira. 'I was in the kitchen when I heard her (Amira) call me names, satan, a witch...why did she come to my house? Just because I'm the second wife, I won't sit down and watch her insult me). I never seduced her man.\\u00a0 'This is my house and this is my compound. I got home late and I heard someone shouting outside my gate. I never went to her place. She came to mine. Kieleweke!' shouted Amber. Speaking on the matter in a recent YouTube video, Amber maintained that she will not be intimidated by Amira just because she is the second wife, adding that she made no mistake accepting to settle down with the businessman. 'Even if I'm the second wife I have not killed anyone and I have been getting so much hatred and Negative energy from social media and it all because of this. I reached a point I had to stand up for myself. You can't keep on insulting me using my past to make me look bad\\u2026As a society I know it is hard to accept second wives but this is what is happening. As much as unakataa kushare, we are sharing,' she said. Amber went on to assure that she is very spiritual and was taken aback\\u00a0after spotting the dead black bird in her compound. 'I got home late and as I was locking the gate I saw a black bird. I immediately asked Jamal to come and see what was happening and it was at this point I called my pastor. He knows how spiritual I am and he (Jamal) asked me to call my pastor\\u2026while engaging her I heard someone shouting outside my compound,' she added.\",\n",

Speaking of this, Janhvi Kapoor and her sister Khushi Kapoor are among the young star kids who follow their fitness routine diligently and almost every day, sweat it out at pilates. Speaking of this, both the sisters were snapped at their Pilates class on Friday. However, they arrived separately and were seen making their way to work out. While Janhvi was seen arriving in a casual yet sporty avatar, Khushi kept it simple in athleisure. In the photos, the Roohi star appeared to be in a rush as she quickly got out of the car and briefly greeted the paps before heading inside. On the other hand, Khushi was seen warmly waving to the photographers as she headed to workout at her class. The star kid is apparently gearing up for her big Bollywood debut. Khushi has been quite active on social media too lately. Talking about Janhvi, she was last seen in Roohi with Varun Sharma and Rajkummar Rao. The film was a horror-comedy. Now, she will be seen in Good Luck Jerry that is helmed by Siddharth Sengupta. Besides this, Janhvi also has Dostana 2 with Karan Johar.\\n\\nPhoto Credit : Viral Bhayani\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) \\u2014 At least 49 people have died in a fire that broke out at a food and beverage factory outside the country's capital, fire officials and local TV stations said Friday.A fire service official, Russel Shikder, confirmed that the fire began Thursday night at the five-story Hashem Food and Beverage Ltd. factory in Rupganj, just outside Dhaka.Debasish Bardhan, deputy director of the Fire Service and Civil Defense, said 49 bodies have been recovered from inside the factory and rescue operations continue. He said the top two floors of the factory have not yet been searched.The main exit gate of the factory, which processes juice, soft drinks and other food items, was locked from inside, he said.Details of the cause of the fire, how many people were inside the factory and how many were missing were not immediately available.Bangladesh has a history of deadly factory fires. They are often attributed to safety lapses that still plague the South Asian country despite its rapid economic growth.Continuing corruption and lax enforcement have resulted in many deaths over the years, and big Western brands, which employ tens of thousands of low-paid workers in Bangladesh, have come under heavy pressure to improve factory conditions after fires and other disasters killed hundreds of people.In February 2019, a blaze ripped through a 400-year-old area cramped with apartments, shops and warehouses in the oldest part of Dhaka and killed at least 67 people. Another fire in Old Dhaka in a house illegally storing chemicals killed at least 123 people in 2010.Authorities imposed tougher safety rules after more than 1,100 people died when a garment factory complex collapsed near Dhaka in 2013. The country's garment industry has since become largely compliant under domestic and global watchdogs, but many other local industries fail to maintain safety compliance.The International Labor Organization said in a 2017 report that Bangladesh's regulatory framework and inspections 'had not been able to keep pace with the development of the industry.\\\" Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

      "      \"summary\": \"When Charlize Theron appears at Cannes in F9: The Fast Saga, it will be her fifth film at the festival.It won't be the best \\u2014 that would probably be 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road, which screened out of competition. Nor will it be the worst \\u2014 that honor goes to 2016's The Last Face, a Sean Penn film that screened in competition, where it was heckled mercilessly.Theron's first appearance in the Cannes lineup was in 2000's competition contender The Yards, directed by James Gray. The unlikely crime drama, set in the world of New York commuter rail maintenance, was based on a corruption scandal involving Gray's own father. It featured a cast of heavyweights: Mark Wahlberg plays an ex-con trying to get his life back on track; Joaquin Phoenix is his best friend; Theron is his cousin; James Caan is a corrupt contractor; Ellen Burstyn is his ailing mom; and Faye Dunaway plays Theron's mother.Nevertheless, The Hollywood Reporter wasn't impressed. Its review called the Miramax film 'less GoodFellas than DullFellas,' and found it to be 'drab and seriously under-plotted \\u2026 the picture will most likely be riding the fast track to the video station.'THR wasn't far off: The $24 million film ($32 million in 2021) made a measly $890,000 at the box office ($1.4 million today). The muted reception didn't hamper Gray, however, who went on to direct films like 2016's The Lost City of Z and 2019's Ad Astra.Theron next appears in Paul Feig's fantasy adventure The School for Good and Evil, due in 2022. \\nContinue Reading \\nShow full articles without \\\"Continue Reading\\\" button for {0} hours.\\n Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nVisit site\\n Send MSN Feedback \\nPlease give an overall site rating: Opens in a new window Opens an external site Opens an external site in a new window\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"*Contains spoilers for Fear Street Part 2: 1978*\\nThe first film in Netflix\\u2018s brand new slasher trilogy Fear Street introduced us to a bunch of teens battling assorted killers in the 1990s \\u2013 and in the second instalment, we go back even further back in time.\\nSpecifically, the film takes us to 1978, and a summer camp attended by residents of both Shadyside and Sunnyvale, which quickly descends into a bloodbath after a seemingly innocent camp counsellor goes on a brutal \\u2013 and wholly uncharacteristic \\u2013 murder spree.\\nThe story is told to Deena and Josh by a survivor from the rampage, and as she continues her tale we slowly learn more about the curse that's was placed on Shadyside by Sarah Fier, the witch who seems to be responsible for the town's continued misfortunes.\\nAs the film reaches its conclusion, the events begin to make sense in conjunction with the first entry in the trilogy, and at the very end, we are given a teaser for the final instalment which takes us back even further to 1666 \\u2013 the time when Sarah Fier lived.\\nRead on for everything you need to know about the ending of Fear Street Part 2: 1978, including how it sets up that final chapter \\u2013 and be warned, there are major spoilers for the first and second Fear Street films ahead.\\nFear Street Part 2 ending explained\\nLet's start by providing some context as to the events of the film: at the very beginning, Deena and Josh (two of the lead characters from the first instalment) seek out Constance Berman to learn more about one of the previous bloodbaths in Shadyside's history, and she duly tells them about Nightwing summer camp, where she was a camper back in 1978.\\nCrucially, Nightwing was built on the very same land where the mall featured in Fear Street Part 1 now stands, and that shared history goes on to have very obvious significance for the plot.\\nAnyway, as events shift to 1978, we meet two sisters from Shadyside\\u2013 goody two shoes Cindy, and her more rebellious younger sister Ziggy, who is something of an outcast.\\nThings first take a weird turn at the camp when Nurse Lane, whom Ziggy has befriended (and whose daughter was one of Shadyside's many previous mass murderers), appears to have a psychotic episode and targets Cindy's boyfriend Tommy Slater \\u2013 who she says 'one way or another is going to die tonight'. This eventually leads to Tommy and Cindy discovering a notebook among Lane's possessions, which includes details about Sarah Fier \\u2013 and how she cut off her hand as part of a deal with the devil.\\nTogether with Cindy's former best friend Alice and her boyfriend, they learn that Sarah's curse will only be lifted if her hand can be reunited with her buried body \\u2013 although it's safe to say that they are all initially rather skeptical when it comes to all this talk about witches and curses.\\nNevertheless, following directions on a map that the nurse had drawn in the diary, they all head to the underground lair where Sarah's hand is supposedly kept \\u2013 where they find all sorts of 'witchy s**t' as Alice puts it.\\nMost crucially of all they find etched onto the walls the names of all of Shadyside's previous killers, but with one surprising addition: Tommy Slater.\\nNot long later, Tommy enters a sort of crazed state and brutally murders Alice's boyfriend, with Cindy and Alice forced to hide from him to save their own lives.\\nThey manage to avoid him, but Tommy escapes and begins his spree, killing several campers while at the same time Cindy and Alice are able to locate Sarah Fier's hand using the diary and escape the lair with some inadvertent help from Ziggy.\\n Fear Street Part 2: 1978 \\u2013 (L-R) TED SUTHERLAND as NICK and SADIE SINK as ZIGGY. Cr: Netflix \\u00a9 2021\\nWith the hand in tow, and the location of her buried body known to them, Cindy, Alice and Ziggy believe they finally have all the tools to lift the curse and save Shadyside for good \\u2013 but before they can do so, Alice is killed and Cindy and Ziggy find the reanimated corpses of the previous Shadyside killers chasing them.\\nCindy and Ziggy both seem to be killed \\u2013 but Ziggy is successfully resuscitated. We then cut back to the 1994 timeline with Constance informing Deena and Josh that she is Ziggy \\u2013 and that no one believed her about the curse, not even Nick Goode, whom she had been beginning a relationship with during the camp and who grew up to be the Sherrif of Shadyside.\\nAfter hearing the story, Deena refuses to accept Constance's belief that the curse can never be stopped \\u2013 informing her that they have found Sarah Fier's body, and if they relocate the hand they can finally reunite them.\\nDeena does exactly that, digging up the hand at the same location that it had been buried back in 1978 \\u2013 which is now on the grounds of Shadyside Mall, of course \\u2013 and taking it to Sarah Fier's grave.\\nWhen she reunites the body and the hand, however, not everything goes quite as expected: a weird series of hallucinatory images begins and Deena appears to wake up in 1666, answering to the name of Sarah Fier \\u2013 perfectly setting up events for the final instalment.\\nFear Street Part 2: 1978 is on Netflix from Friday 9th July, followed by part 3 on the 16th.

      "      \"summary\": \"It's hard to believe it's been 20 years since David Brent first blundered his way onto our screens in The Office \\u2013 Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant's cringe-fest which ran for two series on the BBC. That's two decades of the stapler-in-jelly prank, Gareth Keenan's various tales from the Territorial Army and family parties at which your dad has whipped out that infamous dance.\\nOften cited as one of the best British sitcoms of all time, The Office raked in audiences of up to seven million by the last Christmas special in 2003 and gave us the goatee-wearing gaffe machine that is David Brent: Slough's king of crass one-liners.\\nHowever, The Office doesn't just deserve credit for catapulting Gervais and Merchant to fame (as well as Martin Freeman, Mackenzie Crook and countless other stars) or being the inspiration for its widely popular US remake \\u2013 it's also responsible for ushering in a whole new era of comedy, not just in Britain but worldwide.\\nPrior to 2001, the sitcom scene was populated by multi-camera comedies \\u2013 Absolutely Fabulous, Only Fools and Horses, The Vicar of Dibley, Red Dwarf, Bottom, Birds of a Feather, the list is endless. These 30-minute outfits filmed in front of a live audience dominated the airwaves in the UK and even more so in the US, where the likes of Seinfeld, Friends, Frasier and Full House reigned supreme throughout the 90's, airing to millions of fans each week.\\n Of course, there were a few stand-out sitcoms that switched things up; the surreal single-camera satire Spaced went onto become a cult classic, while comedies like Chris Morris's Brass Eye, That Peter Kay Thing and Rob Brydon's Marion and Geoff flirted with the mockumentary format as we approached the millennium. However, it wasn't until The Office crashed onto BBC Two, with its hilariously awkward look at mundane working life, that the docu-comedy became a mainstream TV hit.\\nViewers became a fly on the wall at fictional paper company Wernham Hogg, where Brent had somehow made it to general manager despite spending his working days distracting his unimpressed colleagues, cracking out his guitar and giving testimonials to camera, boasting about how fun a boss he was. While Gervais's Brent was a wholly unlikeable character, with his inadvertently racism, sexism and embarrassing faux pas leaving fans cringing from behind a sofa cushion, he was the ideal mockumentary target \\u2013 a clueless everyman who audiences recognised and had no problem laughing at, not with.\\nBolstered by the performances of Mackenzie Crook and Ewen MacIntosh as office odd-bods Gareth and Keith Bishop, as well as the love triangle between Tim (Martin Freeman), Dawn (Lucy Davis) and her fianc\\u00e9 Lee (Joel Beckett), The Office became a surefire triumph and while it ended in 2003, somewhat prematurely in the eyes of many fans, it had already injected the TV scene with mockumentary fever.\\n \\nIn the US, The Office remake reached dizzying heights of success, running for nine seasons with Steve Carrell at the helm as Brent's Pennsylvanian counterpart Michael Scott, and kicking off the docu-comedy boom across the pond. Next came political satire Parks and Recreation, produced by The US Office creator Greg Daniels and writer Michael Schur, followed by long-running family sitcom Modern Family and Mitchell Hurwitz's Arrested Development. More recently, we've seen Netflix\\u2018s American Vandal, Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous and What We Do in the Shadows \\u2013 a spin-off of Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi's mockumentary film of the same name \\u2013 land on our screens.\\nBack in the UK, the laughter landscape became populated with mock documentary, reality TV-style satires. Gervais and Merchant moved on from The Office to give us Life's Too Short and Derek, while Twenty Twelve burst onto the BBC ahead of the Olympics, followed by W1A. In recent years, shows like People Just Do Nothing, This Country and Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge have kept the cringe flag flying, with the former two receiving BAFTA awards and This Country even getting its own US remake.\\nAs a result, laugh-track sitcoms are now somewhat of a dying breed. While some are still on the air \\u2013 Not Going Out, Mrs Brown's Boys and Upstart Crow to name a few \\u2013 the more popular shows in recent years have been single-camera comedies, with elements of fourth-wall breaking. Word-of-mouth comedy-drama Fleabag is arguably one of the most popular and influential titles of the 2010s, while Motherland, Derry Girls, Stath Lets Flats and Ghosts are now the epitome of the modern-day sitcom.\\nIt's possible that some of our favourite mockumentaries and sitcoms wouldn't exit today if The Office hadn't introduced the inadvertently hilarious Slough branch of Wernham Hogg back in 2001, and while today marks the cult classic's 20th birthday, it still stands up as one of the best British sitcoms of all time. The Office is available to stream on BritBox and Amazon Prime Video. Visit our TV Guide, or take a look at the rest of our Drama coverage.\",\n",

Grace's co-stars from the reality show, 'Hollywood Queens', Venita Akpofure, Nuella Njubigbo, Mimi Orijiekwe and some of her friends walked the runway to model her designs. The new collection was launched on Saturday, May 29, 2021. Actors and close friends of Grace like Mike Godson also walked the runaway. The fashion show has two segments. The first segment was for evening gowns and, the second featured African prints. The collection is for both men and women. The evening gowns are quite formal. They are most likely for dinning parties, red carpet events, and weddings. The African prints were more relaxed and casual. The male kaftans were creative. Some were casual and others were for more important engagements. Welcome to the Pulse Community! We will now be sending you a daily newsletter on news, entertainment and more.

Shuaib stressed that since the verification and certification, there had been no case of WPV isolated anywhere in the country. 'Nigeria and the African region were certified WPV-free on August, 2020 and therefore, the polio-free status of the country is not in any way under threat. 'The attention of NPHCDA has been drawn to reports in some sections of the media, claiming that there is an outbreak of a new polio variant in some states. This is a gross misrepresentation of the facts. 'For the avoidance of doubt, no case of WPV has been reported anywhere in the country since the last case in 2016. 'What is being misconstrued for an outbreak of WPV is the detection, through our robust disease surveillance system, of 22 cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis, spread across seven (7) States (Borno, Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara). These non-wild polio viruses originated as a result of normal changes in the reproduction of viruses. 'These viruses are not as virulent as WPV and are also being reported in other countries. 'Working with our donors and development partners, Nigeria has already acquired new tools and resources to ensure these viruses are contained,' he explained. He, however, assured Nigerians that the agency and partners would continue to conduct surveillance and vaccination campaigns in order to prevent and contain any possible importation of the Wild Polio Virus.\",\n",

'However, for the 43 minutes that the governor's interview lasted, he at no time mentioned or alluded to any arrested person, including Nnamdi Kanu, nor did he accuse President Muhammadu Buhari of sectional bias. 'Rather, the governor only discussed the Southern Governors' resolution which emphasised their commitment to one, just and egalitarian Nigeria.

Now, it seems the actor and Liezel Lopez are no longer a couple. Not that they actually said so. It's just our assumption as based on their recent, respective tweets. Kristoffer's include such stirring lines as 'clean slate,' 'My heart is happy,' and, 'Di na maliligaw\\u2026' Liezel's are as cryptic. Some of them: 'I am a good woman\\u2026I see the good in everything. I am me. Nobody can change that. \\u2013 Note to self' 'Manipulative sad boy is real guys\\u2026' 'Karma is my middle name\\u2026' So is the relationship kaput? At this point, who knows? If there's one thing we are pretty sure of, the truth will come out sooner than later. Kristoffer admitted to their relationship only last April. Note, however, talk about them making sweet music has been going on for some time already, prior. Some even tagged Liezel as the main reason behind Kristoffer's decision to end his relationship with AC Banzon, who actually bore him a child. What goes around comes around?

      "      \"summary\": \"There are many types of frontal wigs such as full lace, lace 360, lace closure and frontal wigs. Frontal wigs are loved for so many reasons. If properly installed, it looks like natural hair and, you can barely tell the difference. But, when it isn't installed well, it is an eyesore. Typically, an installed lace wig lasts for two to four weeks. If you are wearing a normal wig you keep removing it and putting it back on, but a frontal wig can stay in its place for a good while. A lace wig can be styled anyhow you want. You have more options. It can be style up in a high bun, parted, plaited. It is difficult to install. Even some hairstylists are not well skilled. So you might end up looking quite tacky. If your hairline is not good naturally, you should think twice before gluing things on it because it might damage your hairline. It takes a lot of work. You must use foundation, concealer, blow dryer and many more products. It is more expensive and requires maintenance. Because of how versatile these wigs are, there are many ways you can style them so you would not damage your edges. You can decide to leave some part of your hair out and blend it with the lace frontal. (Although most people prefer to use the frontal wig's hair for their edges.) Another option is to get a lace closure or lace fringe that would not require adhesive. The most important thing is the styling and the quality of the wig. Use the best products always!\",\n",

They also shot and killed one Ahmad Muhammad, while Haruna Isyaku Duniya received medical treatment for gunshot injuries. The polytechnic's spokesperson, Abdullahi Shehu, announced on Thursday, July 8 that the hostages were released on Thursday night at an undisclosed location in Kaduna. He told Channels TV that the release was a result of negotiations between the kidnappers and families of the hostages. They will soon be received by the school authorities and reunited with their loved ones. Kaduna is the most affected by a series of high-profile school abductions that have recently plagued the country, especially the northern region. Six major attacks have been launched on schools in the state since March, with five of them resulting in the abduction of hundreds of students and staff, and death of around a dozen people. Hundreds of students have similarly been kidnapped in Katsina, Niger, Zamfara, Edo, Benue, and Plateau since December. Authors: Samson Toromade Welcome to the Pulse Community!

      "      \"summary\": \"Mr Deola-Tayo Lordbanjou, Programme Manager, Root and Tuber Expansion Programme, Federal Ministry of Agriculture, says Nigeria accounts for 47 million metric tonnes of yam production globally. In his paper, entitled: 'Status and Prospects of Yam in Nigeria,' the expert put the current global production of yam at 73 million metric tonnes. Out of this, he said that Nigeria accounted for 47 metric tonnes, valued at N57.75 billion annually. 'According to International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), most of the world production comes from West African countries, representing 94 per cent, with Nigeria alone producing 71 per cent. 'Nigeria is the world highest producer of yam, cultivating about 2.9 million hectares of land.\\\" Lordbanjoue noted that the development of yam value chain in Nigeria could be partly attributed to use of modern farm inputs and improved technology. According to him, yam has higher production value than maize, rice, cassava and millet combined. Also speaking, Dest Officer, Yam Value Chain in the ministry, Dr Perpetua Iyere-Usiahon, said that the use of sack bags had been introduced to cultivate yams in order to guarantee food security in Nigeria. Perpetua, in her paper, entitled: 'Beetle Infestation Management and Innovation in Yam Production in Nigeria,' noted that organic dust had been introduced to cultivate yams. She explained that the organic dust served as fertiliser and treatment for beetle-infested yams, stressing that yams cultivated with organic dust were fit for human consumption. 'We are discouraging farmers from using chemical dust to cultivate yams. Using organic dust is better and it increases production,' she said. According to her, the looming food crisis and insecurity in the country had necessitated the introduction of cultivation of yams in sack bags, thus enabling yam cultivation all year round.

      "      \"summary\": \"The Fashion Lab, a first-of-its-kind in the Kingdom, is focused on sustainable fashion, contemporary design, streetwear and accessories, and nurturing new designers who are set on disrupting the fashion status quo.Applications are now open and successful participants will get to take part in a two-week 'boot camp,' which will help them navigate through different elements to develop their brand, including marketing, supply chain management, content creation and media exposure.Fashion sales in the GCC amount to around $50 billion a year, according to a McKinsey report in December 2019, with the average spent per capita amounting to around $500 in Saudi Arabia.With online fashion sales booming as a result of people stuck at home during the pandemic, Statista estimates that the Kingdom's online clothing segment will be worth $1.484 billion in 2021 and is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 5.19 percent for the next four years.Namshi, the online e-commerce site owned by Dubai's Emaar Malls, told Arab News in February it had seen 50 percent growth in revenues from Saudi Arabia in the last year and is set to expand into a new warehouse facility in Riyadh to capitalise on surging sales. While parent company Emaar Malls recently reported a 24.8 percent fall in revenues for 2020 to AED3.51 billion ($960 million), Namshi saw sales increase 28 percent to AED1.316 billion over the same period, with the Kingdom representing 70 percent of sales.On top of the $15,000 funding, applicants may also be offered equity partnerships after the program finishes at the end of the year, and may also access the Chalhoub Group's online and in-store retail network to sell their products.Dina Sidani, chief innovation officer, said that she believed the Fashion Lab 'will have long-term positive impact in promoting innovation in the fashion industry locally, while creating young fashion champions from the Kingdom for the world.'Based in Dubai, the group has been a major operator in Saudi Arabia for more than 50 years. It is active in 14 countries, with around 700 stores and 12,000 employees.Up to five brands will be selected to take part in the Fashion Lab and the deadline for submissions for the first cohort is July 25, 2021.Applications are now open and successful participants will get to take part in a two-week \\u2018boot camp,' which will help them navigate through different elements to develop their brand, including marketing, supply chain management, content creation and media exposure.The initiative is part of a wider push to develop the Saudi fashion sector and nurture homegrown brands. On Wednesday, the Kingdom's Fashion Commission announced the finalists chosen to take part in its yearlong Saudi 100 Brands program. The initiative will include training, advice and mentorship from experts in the fashion sector.A shortlist of 400 was whittled down from an initial 1,348 applicants.The program offers a one-year brand development initiative with training and mentoring, individual and group consultancy and advisory sessions, and virtual and in-person training workshops.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"The Vintage Bar is a community that connects buyers and sellers of premium and luxury secondhand fashion. By combining digital innovation, data driven technologies and inspirational branding, we take part in making fashion circular. The Vintage Bar has been setting a new fashion standard since 2017. Challenging the prevailing idea that new is always better, we work to rewrite the narrative of luxury fashion. The Vintage Bar is a marketplace, which offers pre-owned premium and luxury fashion for less. We are offering a vast selection of authenticated clothing, bags, and accessories that are competitively priced (at up to 70% off retail!). Though primarily online, we also have a showroom in Copenhagen's city center, where we are based. Through creative branding and digital innovation, we aspire to create an experience that is inspiring, inclusive and personalized. At The Vintage Bar, we prioritize authentication, accessibility, sustainability, digital innovation, and education. Through our online and social media presence, we have created a platform that informs consumers and inspires them to shop secondhand. More than just a luxury fashion marketplace, we are a community that strives to change the industry from the inside out. A Circular Fashion Universe It is no secret that the fashion industry is not sustainable. Research shows that, after oil, it is the second largest polluting industry on the planet. Due to mass overproduction and the use of harmful contaminants in its products, much of the blame has been placed on fast fashion. However, as it encourages overconsumption, luxury fashion is not devoid of fault. In 2000, European fashion companies offered on average two collections per year, but according to the European Parliament, many increased to five by 2011. Fashion has become fixated on newness. As a result, even though they are made to last, many luxury pieces are sadly left at the back of closets. As a member of the circular fashion movement, The Vintage Bar works to break this wasteful cycle. We recirculate unwanted pieces, helping to increase the lifespan of luxury fashion. Pioneering the Power of Secondhand and More Pioneering change is in our DNA. The Vintage Bar strives to dispel any negative, outdated, and ill-informed stereotypes surrounding secondhand fashion, propelling it to new levels of desirability and demand. In recent years, the fashion world has followed suit. An increasing number of designers have delved into their archives, reintroducing styles that were originally released decades ago. Vintage and secondhand fashion is now on-trend. To revolutionize the customer shopping experience, elevating secondhand to an exclusive brand experience, we use emerging technologies. Whether in our online shop or showroom, these ensure that each customer receives personalized service. We know exactly what our customers are looking for \\u2013 even if they do not themselves! We Are More Than Just a Luxury Fashion Marketplace, We Are a Community Through our editorial, known as The Archive, we offer expert insight into the brands we carry, sharing our knowledge of their heritage and craftsmanship, so our customers make informed purchases they feel confident in. Covering everything from authenticity to DIY repairs, The Archive challenges luxury fashion's culture of secrecy. Through our Instagram account (@the_vintage_bar), we engage with our community, which is over half a million and growing! Together, we celebrate secondhand fashion and inspire others to shop consciously. After just four years, The Vintage Bar has become a premier marketplace for pre-owned luxury fashion. With the help of our community, we will make secondhand the new normal. This article does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Editors or the management of EconoTimes\",\n",

Many upscale fashion brands line up their initial public offer (IPO) plans to make an entry into Dalal Street. According to a report in the Economic Times, fashion labels, including Manyavar, Fabindia, GoColours, Biba Apparels seek public listings. These fashion levels are in talks with multiple investment bankers to launch their IPOs, the publication mentioned citing industry sources. Nearly all of the brands mentioned above are backed by bulge-bracket private equity investors, including Warburg Pincus and Faering Capital. According to the financial daily, Manyavar and Fabindia are planning IPOs to raise between Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 2,500 crore and GoColours is likely to enter the market with an issue size of Rs 800-900 crore. Meanwhile,\\u00a0Biba is in initial stages of talks for a public listing, bankers told ET. Vedant Fashions, owner of Manyavar, and Go Fashion (India), which operates under the GoColours brand, have already hired investment bankers to shepherd their IPOs, one of the bankers told the publication. IPOs of most of these fashion labels will include a mix of both primary issuances and offers for sale (OFS) from existing investors, including private equity players. Kedaara Capital is one of the investors in Manyavar, while PremjiInvest and Lighthouse Funds are invested in Fabindia. Private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Faering Capital have stakes in Biba Apparels, while Sequoia and ICICI Venture are large investors in Go Fashion. Worth mentioning here is that in-store sales have been hurt at exclusive fashion retailers through the pandemic, but robust web-commerce business and increased focus on casual wear helped protect these labels. It may be noted that except for Arvind Fashions, most of the listed fashion brands have seen their shares rallying over the last one year. Shares of Monte Carlo Fashions have jumped 117% in the last one year while Aditya Birla Fashion and TCNS Clothing company have gained 76% and nearly 72% respectively in the last year.\",\n",

According to Fox News, Kalman works as an art director and has collaborated with Travis Scott and Kng Kng Records, among others. Hadid was first romantically linked to the artist in early June when they were spotted out on a lunch date together. As per reports, they were apparently introduced through friends and their relationship started up following her split from on-again-off-again boyfriend The Weeknd, who sparked his own romance rumors this week after dining with Angelina Jolie. However long the pair have been dating, the model does not seem to be keeping Kalman under wraps anymore. She posted a sweet photo of them canoodling on a balcony while travelling between Paris and Cannes for the Cannes Film Festival and Paris Fashion Week. Kalman has also done projects in the fashion industry sphere, designing logo art for Made Fashion Week and fashion brand A Bathing Ape. He was also involved with a Smoke x Mirrors eyewear campaign and worked as a \\\"fashion assistant\\\" for major publications, as per his website. He is very private about his personal life and does not have public social media accounts. But his Instagram has a number of high-profile followers aside from Hadid, like Virgil Abloh, Diplo and Fai Khadra.(To receive our E-paper on whatsapp daily, please click here.

Mary Quant: Fashion Revolutionary runs until July 11, 2021 (so be quick). It tells the story of one the 20th century's most influential fashion designers, Londoner Mary Quant. Quant's daring designs revolutionised women's fashion in the 1950s and 1960s, and were entwined with the feminist movement. Her clothes shop, Bazaar, opened on Chelsea's King's Road in 1955, and from there her boutique store grew into a fashion empire. She popularised (some say invented) the mini-skirt, and brought the jersey dress into the mainstream. She also championed tights, trousers, patterned sweaters and PVC raincoats. The exhibition has over 100 garments from 1955 \\u2013 1975, and the fun and atmosphere of the swinging \\u201860s in London is brought to life through historic videos and projections. On display also is Quant's 'Daisy' fashion doll, a rival to Barbie. A savvy businesswoman, the exhibition also explores how Quant built an empire, mass-producing her clothes and breaking into far-flung markets such as Australia. Brett Whiteley: Drawing is Everything opens on July 31, 2021 and explores critical role drawing played in the creative process for the master abstract painter. Then a new exhibition from contemporary female Islamic artists, SOUL fury, opens on August 7 and explores the nature of female agency showcasing works from leading sculptors, photographers, painters, videographers and textile artists.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Thanks to Joor, a New York online platform that brands itself as 'the future of wholesale', Pippa Small carried on selling her jewellery through the pandemic. 'We use Joor to create orders for most of our accounts, such as Twist in the US and White Bird in Paris,' says Small, who has subscribed to the business-to-business service since 2014.According to Kristin Savilia, chief executive of Joor, her company's objective is to help digital transformation across 'all categories of wholesale, including jewellery'.The platform's subscribers include luxury conglomerates \\u2014 such as LVMH, Kering and Richemont \\u2014 as well as smaller designer fine jewellery brands including Ileana Makri, Wwake and Polly Wales. It allows brands to work with any retailer they do business with (and access is free for their retailers). Retailers purchasing jewellery on Joor include Harrods, Selfridges, Liberty and Net-a-Porter. They do so by visiting virtual showrooms on the platform and purchasing digitally.Tech solutions like this, across the fashion industry, have been attracting investor attention. Last month, Joor raised $46m in funding led by Australian group Macquarie. In March, Lightspeed, a Montreal ecommerce provider, entered into an agreement to buy NuOrder, of Los Angeles, the second-largest apparel wholesale platform after Joor, for $425m. During the pandemic both platforms moved into the digital trade show space, with Passport, a service provided by Joor, hosting 17 global events last year \\u2014 including London Fashion Week. Anna Jewsbury, founder of jewellery brand Completedworks, exhibited virtually through Passport at London Fashion Week. 'Retailers that were already on Joor came across our digital profile,' she says. 'They were all smaller fashion boutiques and were interested in our fashion jewellery.' Completedworks no longer wholesales its fine jewellery but sells to clients such as Alex Eagle on a consignment basis \\u2014 a commonplace practice in designer fine jewellery.Nouvelle Box of London, the first business-to-business marketplace platform tailored to jewellery, was built with both consignment and wholesale in mind. 'The pandemic was the trigger for me,' says Darren Hildrow, previously jewellery director at agency Rainbowwave, who joined Valery Demure, an industry specialist, to launch the platform in February. Nouvelle Box specialises in designer jewellery brands that straddle the worlds of fashion and jewellery, are mostly small scale and are known for setting jewellery trends.'From the outside, people see diamonds and gold and think that fine jewellery brands have a lot of money,' Hildrow explains. 'They don't. It's hard to run a small fine jewellery brand and make ends meet, so we keep the Nouvelle Box subscription within reach of small designers.'As jewellery does not work at the pace of the fashion industry, he says the role of the platform is to smooth the shift from paper to digital, by offering tools to create consignment documents and order forms all in one place. Nouvelle Box works with a range of brands, from fine diamond-focused jewellers such as Mindi Mond of New York to Capucine H, a French avant-garde designer. Broken Snowflake ring by Capucine H Alice Cicolini, one of 30 jewellery brands to have signed up so far, says that 'instead of spending time on bits of paperwork', the platform provides a relatively seamless way to do business with a group of retailers. She also hopes it will allow her to use face-to-face time to deepen retail relationships when she returns to trade shows such as Couture.The idea is that a brand displays a profile, information and collection photographs, and opts for one of three levels of visibility. They can then contact any of the 100-plus jewellery-focused retailers they don't already work with, using a LinkedIn-style messaging system. Nouvelle Box says it is as much about 'creating community' as facilitating commerce. There is a magazine area with articles by jewellery specialists and a services section that showcases vetted professionals who offer marketing, editorial, or video services. And there are plans to create a section for personal stylists who work with wealthy clients.Nouvelle Box has also joined with Ylang23, a Texas retailer, to support its Next Now award. As a result, Pari Fine Jewels, designed by Athens-born Pari Sofianou will be showcased on Nouvelle Box, free for a year.So far, the platform seems to have won over retailers because of the sense of discovery that it offers. 'While we use a variety of platforms, we generally do not rely on them for sourcing designer fine jewellery,' says Beth Kanfer, footwear, handbag, jewellery and soft accessory fashion director of store group Nordstrom. 'However, the brand curation provided by Nouvelle Box adds value as it provides access to a diverse selection of emerging brands with authenticity and limited distribution.'Ruby Beales, jewellery buying manager at Liberty, is drawn to the site because it is so targeted. 'I love that Nouvelle Box is a bespoke platform, specifically for the jewellery business. It was founded by industry experts who know just what jewellery buyers and retailers are looking for, rather than the more one-size-fits-all approach of other platforms, which tend to work with a variety of brands across all categories.'As the world opens up, many retailers and brands expect platforms to coexist and blend with physical events, such as Paris Fashion Week or Couture.\",\n",

YonhapContenders choose styles, colors to deliver deeper messages By Kang Seung-wooWhile the presidential hopefuls are busy promoting their campaign pledges, they are also trying to appeal to voters with their fashion and style, which play a role in showing who they are, as well as in helping make a good impression on voters \\u2015 which is often nearly as important as what the politicians say. Currently, the liberal ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) is going through a preliminary primary to pick its candidate for the presidential election in March next year, while the conservative main opposition People Power Party (PPP) is scheduled to start its selection process in August.Gyeonggi Province Governor Lee Jae-myung participates in a televised debate at JTBC Studios in Seoul, July 5. YonhapGyeonggi Province Governor Lee Jae-myung, one of the leading presidential contenders from the liberal ruling bloc, appears to be seeking stability in his fashion.The 56-year-old is refining his \\\"fighter\\\" image and instead displaying a polished and hard-working appearance by not dyeing his hair black as he did in 2017 but instead leaving it grey, and by wearing tight-fitting suits and metal-rimmed glasses, versus horn-rimmed ones.\\\"The governor has received advice on how to dress through various channels, but the final decision is made by his wife,\\\" said a representative of the Lee campaign. Compared to Lee, some of the other, older presidential contenders are trying to show voters a dynamic and energetic appearance, through measures such as wearing a suit without a tie. Rep. Lee Nak-yon, the former DPK chairman and former prime minister, is seeking to shift his previous dignified image by wearing bright-colored shirts and pants, along with loafers. Rep. Lee Nak-yon of the liberal ruling Democratic Party of Korea listens during a DPK preliminary primary in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, July 4. YonhapChung Sye-kyun, another former prime minister, prefers wearing blazers and pants as opposed to formal suits, without a tie, in what seems to be a move to appeal to young voters. For example, in a video clip posted on the video-sharing platform, TikTok, in June, Chung, a former six-term lawmaker, wore a leather jacket-featured cowboy outfit and hip-hop clothing with a bucket hat to convey an image of friendliness. Choo Mi-ae, the former justice minister, prefers attire that reflects the image of a career woman and a reform politician, with a short bob haircut.Using German Chancellor Angela Merkel as a benchmark, the 62-year-old often dresses in a formal way, with her top and pants the same color, and rarely wearing skirts so as to show her activeness.Rep. Park Yong-jin of the liberal ruling Democratic Party of Korea visits the nation's largest start-up support center in Seoul, July 2. YonhapRep. Park Yong-jin, 50, regarded as a leading figure of the younger generation of lawmakers, dresses in business casual attire to show that he is a young and active politician seeking to reform politics. During the first televised debate of the DPK's presidential contenders, he was the only one who dressed down, wearing cotton pants and sneakers. \\\"Given that Park is the youngest presidential hopeful in the DPK primary, he often wears casual jackets, short-sleeve T-shirts and sneakers,\\\" said a representative from the Park camp.Rep. Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative main opposition People Power Party during a press conference in Seoul, June 29. YonhapOn the conservative opposition side, Yoon Seok-youl, the former prosecutor general who is a leading presidential hopeful, drew attention during a press conference to announce his presidential bid, last month, and at another public event, by wearing a blue tie. Given that the color has represented the liberal ruling party in recent years, the choice was seen as suggesting that he is pursuing an image of unity. It also could mean that Yoon is seeking to expand his support base to centrist voters.Rep. Hong Joon-pyo of the PPP, known for his preference for the color red in his outfits, has been converting to blue as well, as the five-term lawmaker is often seen wearing blue ties and masks, in what, in his case, seems to be an effort to ease his image as a hardline conservative politician. \\\"I am trying to change my image of 'kkondae,'\\\" he confessed in a recent media interview. \\\"Kkondae\\\" refers to people who are authoritarian and always think that what they say or do is right, while ignoring others' (typically younger people's) points of view.Yoo Seong-min, a former four-term lawmaker, and Jeju Governor Won Hee-ryong, have both been wearing casual suits to give off a friendly impression, while Rep. Yun Hee-suk, who prefers to wear a black or white vest when appearing in public, is known for dressing unpretentiously, reflecting an image of being plain and unostentatious.Rep. Yun Hee-suk of the conservative main opposition People Power Party holds a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul, July 2. Yonhap\",\n",

(Yonhap)The Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Green Seoul Citizens Committee jointly hosted a fashion show behind closed doors Friday to underscore the importance of climate variability at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in central Seoul. This year's fashion show was held without an audience under the slogan 'Dealing with climate change with citizens.' Related videos will be available on YouTube. 'I would like to thank the citizens and companies for participating in making clean and useful products from reusable plastic packaging in an era where we are confronting the global warming crisis,' said Lee Dong-ryul, a senior official overseeing the city\\u2018s environmental policy.Lee added that the city government plans to attain zero net emissions of carbon by 2050. Bags made from cactus, shorts and pants made out of waste plastic water bottles and eco-friendly outfits made from natural materials and regenerated fibers were tailored to the models who strutted down the catwalk. The ethical and sustainable items showcased during the event were sponsored by various brands, including make:D and Black Yak. Around 30 models, including 10 ordinary people, senior models and university students majoring in fashion, took to the stage to lead the runway show. Since 2012, the Seoul city government and Seoul Citizen Committee for Green Seoul have paired up for campaigns under the theme of 'cool-down dressing' to encourage using less energy by wearing clothes that keep you feeling chill during the scorching summer weather.

While technology continues to reign the world today, its beautiful ruins, age-old coliseums, and awe-inspiring sculptures remind everyone of the world's ancient charm, earning it the title of the Eternal City. That is what Fendi celebrates with its latest fashion presentation. The Italian luxury house pays homage to the city by merging its old and new sensibilities in its autumn-winter 2021 couture collection. Led by English fashion designer Kim Jones, the collection showcased men's and women's pieces featuring mosaic designs, tailored suits, romantic silhouettes, and a celebration of texture and sheen thanks to delicate embroideries, recycled fur, and mother-of-pearl embellishments. \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n To present Kim's sophomore couture collection, the fashion house created a runway setup that is true to Rome's majestic landscape and architecture, which makes a perfect backdrop for its fashion film. The stylish featurette is shot by Luca Guadagnino, the 'Call Me By Your Name' director, and is inspired by Pasolini's neorealism cinema, making it a true poetic visual experience. 'Rome is a fascinating city because it has so many pasts\\u2014and I was drawn to Pasolini because I have always been inspired by his vision of the world,' says Kim. 'He is something of an outsider in Roman history, but one whose voice remains constant. I have long admired Luca's work\\u2014and he is someone who, like Pasolini, touches on subjects which are relevant to now.'

I didn't want anyone to have to choose between clean makeup they should buy and the cool makeup they want to buy.

Apart from its beautiful color, texture and design, what's great about the silky mask is it doesn't smudge your Saie makeup, not even the new super creamy Sun Melt bronzer which the team just launched to give customers that deep summer glow.\\u00a0 \\\"Beyond good makeup, we wanted to promote a good lifestyle and brand.

      "      \"summary\": \"Senegalese organizations host fashion show to inspire, enable and engage women across Africa Advocacy tank\\u00a0Speak Up Africa\\u00a0and renowned fashion label\\u00a0Tongoro\\u00a0reaffirmed their commitment to gender equality by hosting a fashion show to mark the\\u00a0Generation Equality Forum. Held in Paris, France last week and convened by UN Women, the Forum fueled a powerful and enduring coalition for gender equality, bringing together governments, activists, corporations, feminist organizations, youth and allies to achieve transformative change. The week of events saw commitments of over USD $40 billion pledged for gender equality by governments, donors and corporates. Recognizing the importance of voice, decision-making, arts and leadership as key elements of female empowerment, Speak Up Africa joined forces with the Senegalese fashion brand Tongoro and music artist\\u00a0Obree Daman\\u00a0for the show. 'Fashion has long been recognized as a way to empower women; for many of us clothes are not simply to be worn, they are also used to make a statement. I've worked with and dressed many inspiring and strong women throughout my career, and it's a pleasure to do so in support of the Generation Equality Forum. Through this show, and the other activities taking place across Africa, we strive to improve gender equality and craft the continent's future',\\u00a0said Sarah Diouf, Founder of Tongoro. Inspiring, enabling and engaging women, the show, called \\u2018African LeadHERS', brought together leaders across the arts and cultural sector. 'Women empowerment, and the inclusion of women and girls on public platforms and in leadership, is a fundamental right and critical to our development. As part of the Generation Equality Forum's Action Coalition on economic justice and rights, I am proud to stand for increasing women's economic empowerment. 2021 can be a landmark year in our fight for gender equality in Africa, but we must all act for equal. It's an honor to see so many inspirational women uniting to share their voices and experiences, as the movement for gender equality gains pace across the African continent',\\u00a0addedOulimata Sarr, Regional Director West and Central Africa at UN Women. Gender equality is vital to the collective success of Africa against the sustainable development goals. Currently, it is expected that gender gaps will take over 120 years to close in Sub-Saharan Africa, and over 135 years for pay and leadership equity to be reached. With the fourth world conference on women taking place 26 years ago, too little has changed. Through hosting this event, Speak Up Africa wishes to reinforce that gender equality supports all the essential foundations for a healthy economy and prosperous nations. 'We are delighted to once again partner with Tongoro and share our passion for gender equality in Africa. Inspiration and empowerment take many forms, and this fashion show is a perfect example of how female-led organizations can support and uplift each other. Gender equality is paramount to achieving every one of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals and as a female-led organization we are committed to transforming this belief into meaningful action and engagement',\\u00a0concluded\\u00a0Yacine Djibo, Founder and Executive Director of Speak Up Africa.

The designer has taken the fashion world by storm and is now positioned to make big waves with her Netflix docuseries, My Unorthodox Life.The series documents Haart's decision to leave her established life in a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish community and branch out into embracing her own passions for fashion and design.\\\"My whole life I was forced to cover myself. So basically, the only parts of my body that were showing were my hands and my face,\\\" Haart told ET's Lauren Zima as she guided ET cameras on a tour of her impressive abode. \\\"It comes from this concept that women should cover their bodies so as not to attract male attention because he may come to have impure thoughts. And my personal take on this is, 'Why is that my problem? It's not.'\\\"As Haart showed off her expansive custom closet -- inspired by the iconic closet from the classic 1995 comedy Clueless -- she reflected on how the life choice made her feel like \\\"a time traveler.\\\"\\\"I went from the 1800s to the 21st century and that's literally what it felt like,\\\" Haart explained, adding that she managed to change her life and strike out on her own through \\\"a mix of insane stubbornness and massive ignorance -- and an absolute miracle.\\\"Moving from her conservative community and out into the world of fashion, Haart began with her own namesake shoe line, before becoming the creative director for La Perla. Now, she's the co-owner and CEO of Elite World Group, a talent management group with a roster of high-powered clients and living in a penthouse in New York City.It's an appropriate locale for the mogul and mother of four, who said she was truly inspired to follow her dreams by a TV show set in the Big Apple.\\\"The first time I watched a rated R movie, I was 38 years old. [Actually], it wasn't a movie, it was actually a TV show and it was called Sex and the City,\\\" she recalled. \\\"It was [about] women living on their own. And they were making their own money, they had their own apartments, and I was like, 'Whoa, is that a thing? People do that in that world? That is unbelievable!'\\\"My Unorthodox Life, which details Haart's unique journey and ascension in the fashion world, premieres July 14 on Netflix.

      "      \"summary\": \"AC Milan was once a football titan, dominating on the pitch and shaping the beautiful game via fashion and footwork. After a few years of obscurity, it is on a mission to retrieve its cultural credentials. Casper Stylsvig, its chief revenue officer, frankly shares how he's rebuilding the Rossoneri. Can this shrewd marketer be the hero the San Siro needs?The seven-time Champions League winners are back in the tournament for the first time since 2014, having languished in mid-table mediocrity. They last won Serie in 2011. Some of its most hardcore fans weren't even born then. Stylsvig's the man tasked with changing that. His football pedigree has taken him from FC Barcelona to Manchester United and Fulham over the last 15 years. He joined a troubled AC Milan in March 2019. The Dane says: 'We control everything outside the pitch, we don't control the performance on the pitch.'His mission is to 'win football through culture' and 'attract a younger audience'. You can't just rely on on-the-pitch successes anymore, he adds. Thankfully, those have been improving swiftly.He reflects on 'a few seasons of difficulties'. In 2017, Chinese businessman Li Yonghong bought the club from Silvio Berlusconi, media mogul and three-time prime minister whose brow-raising ownership took it to immense highs and subsequent lows. Li's mission was to make China fall further in love with the club. That didn't exactly happen. Instead the team lost contact with the businessman and current owners Elliott Management took control of what The Financial Times described as a \\u2018distressed asset' \\u2013 the club was in need of a clear goal and a good assist.Stylsvig says now the club is 'doing the right things for the right reasons' and building the solid foundations of a modern football brand. He's overseen a huge digital transformation project, and exported the club on to the metaverse via Fortnite. It now manages an esports team called Qlash, hosts virtual gigs, makes waves in the fashion world and has built a media studio to accommodate growing demand from partners. Stylsvig indicates that the club is finally ready to start delivering on its legacy in the football elite. Media consumptionFootball's changed since AC Milan was at the top of the game.Stylsvig says fans consume the sport differently. He recalls his Danish childhood watching the full 90 minutes of not so-glamorous English fixtures like Wimbledon v Crystal Palace. With limited media, that was probably the best thing on TV. In 2021, it may be the worst.'The younger generation are using several screens when they watch the game \\u2013 some might favor the highlights, so we shift in how we communicate to these young fans. They want to know everything. It is no longer just about the match.'As football clubs pick up partners and become attention vehicles, many have expanded their content output to extend the window of engagement between games. Behind-the-scenes prove popular \\u2013 younger fans 'want to know everything, they want to know how professional footballers live their lives, how they train, how they eat, how they relax'.He calls this strategy 'from Monday to match day', with a goal to be relevant every day. Being in Fortnite, where the target audience is spending a lot of its time, was one approach. 'The success we saw in that partnership was just phenomenal.' Even the stadium was filled with Fortnite characters. And then there was a virtual concert a few months ago to showcase young talent. You'll see youth crop up a lot, from the outreach to the team building. It aims to have one of the youngest teams in Europe \\u2013 with the exception of statesmanlike Ibrahimovic, who's back at the club.'We're a forward-thinking club, focusing very much on innovation. It is what brands want and it is what the consumer wants. We're a football club but we are in the entertainment business. We have to give the consumers what they want or we will become irrelevant.'Stylsvig on StyleMilan, as one of the world's fashion capitals, presents an almost unique opportunity to brands. Stylsvig admits AC Milan has a headstart here, maybe only matched by PSG.'We see there is a huge link between the fashion world and the sports world. Many footballers are highly engaged in fashion, and that makes the brands interested in football.'\\nLast year AC Milan worked with fashion group Paper Planes on an exclusive collection. The club have only just started pulling on this thread. 'It was our first real fashion interaction with Paper Planes and we sold out the line in 48 hours.'Football, fashion and commerce works \\u2013 no surprise to anyone who's been offering a thick wad of notes to their favorite clubs all these years for a jersey. 'The rest of the class are still asleep but this is somewhere we will focus a lot going forward.'SocialitesInstagram's where the club sees most of its growth, and it is apparently the app where most of the fans spend their time. TikTok's becoming increasingly important and Twitch hosts a lot of activity, particularly esports output.AC Milan's also pushing on seven Chinese apps, but Stylsvig reminds us that Serie A was being broadcast on CCTV back in the 80s and 90s and that the club's always been big in China.It is worth remembering social media growth in football is often anchored to the players, who play a dual role as influencers. AC Milan is no longer a team comprised of world-class superstars \\u2013 Kaka, Shevchenko, Cafu, Dida, Nesta, Maldini, Gattuso, Van Basten, Pirlo, Inzaghi, Guilt, Weah and, undeniably atop the pile, Ronaldinho are just a few. That's no accident. 'We're taking a sensible approach here with the players we are signing. Alex Ferguson used to say: \\u2018No player is bigger than the club.''So on the pitch and off it, AC is following this mantra. On social, every player gets a fair amount of exposure. 'In player engagement we never use the same person too much. We want to give the same exposure to everyone. We believe when you're a first team, you're all on the same level.'When AC Milan was last prominent players didn't have so much power. Social media changed that. When Ronaldo moved from Real Madrid to the hated Juventus, he reportedly vacuumed 1 million followers with him and half of the club's Instagram followers. It's a risky strategy. ContentmentTo stand a chance in entertainment and hit steep revenue goals, content is key. It's cheaper and faster to do this in-house, hence the investment in a new media studio at the start of 2021.\\nDuring the pandemic, there was increased demand for content from partners. Meanwhile, when football went silent and stadiums were strictly empty, the club had to find its audience once more online.'The pandemic fast-tracked us, we needed to be much more digital-savvy.' In a year, it doubled its content output and brought aboard roughly 14 new partners during lockdown. One campaign's now a widely-distributed TikTok case study.But when pressed on why a football club like AC Milan should be a brand's go-to, instead of a content or influencer agency, Stylsvig pauses for thought. 'We are consumers but none of us like to be sold to. If you use football as a platform to gain engagement, then you might convince the consumer.'He adds: 'We hope brands buy into our big plans and innovation, and winning people through culture by merging the team with sport, fashion and design.'The strategy has the club 'back to black numbers' and out of the red after 'a few difficult years'.For now, at least, it will remain cost-conscious and do everything it can to drive revenue. It won't be splashing 'silly' money on players anytime soon, but long-time fans will probably be enthused by the stability, and if not that then perhaps the host of new content and Fortnite skins.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"What do we mean by NFTs? \\u2018Non-fungible' means that the object is unique and cannot be replaced with something else. For example, a \\u00a3 or a $ or a \\u20ac is fungible i.e., it can be traded/swapped for another \\u00a3 or $ or \\u20ac. If you were to trade a \\u2018one-of-a-kind' asset e.g., a non-fungible asset such as a video, Tweet or picture for a different asset, you would have something completely different. The token part of an NFT signifies that the asset as a digital representation on a Blockchain; initially Ethereum was used but, increasingly, we are seeing more Blockchains offering their own version of NFTs, with the huge advantage that other Blockchains can be used at a fraction of the cost of using Ethereum.Undeniably, the fashion industry is obsessed with authenticity and exclusivity. After all, this is how it is able to justify such high prices, and an NFT able to prove authenticity and exclusivity was ultimately always going to appeal to the global fashion houses. The fact that an NFT can be used in the real world (as well as the virtual world of gaming) offers a whole new market for the fashion industry to monetise its brands accordingly. An Accenture report estimates that the global gaming industry exceeds $300billion and now NFTs can be sold and traded in the gaming industry by fashion\\u00a0brands.Gucci's \\u2018Queen Bee Dionysus' bag, was originally priced at $5.50, but with clever digital marketing and promotion by being available for just an hour day on two days, its price rocketed to $4,115. It is not simply bags though, as Gucci recently auctioned a four-minute NFT video at Christie's for $25,000, demonstrating that global fashion brands are undoubtedly beginning to pay attention to NFTs! NFTS have encouraged new fashion-dedicated NFT platforms, such as Neuno, to be established for designers and allow customers to pay with credit cards and cryptocurrencies. As the magazine Vogue mentioned in a recent article, DressX is another NFT marketplace for the fashion industry.DressX\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aThe Atari Classic\\u00a0RobeSource: DressX.comInteresting to note is that John Egan, CEO of L'Atelier BNP Paribas, predicts: 'Spending on items like digital clothes and character upgrades to grow to $129 billion in 2021 from $109 billion in 2019. Because NFTs can act as a \\u2018digital twin' of a real-life garment\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aproving authenticity and provenance\\u200a\\u2014\\u200abrands like Louis Vuitton and Nike are now actively investing in blockchain technology.'Furthermore, as the publication nssmag.com has commented, there are four reasons why NFTs are attracting the global fashion\\u00a0brands:\\u2022 'An NFT can make virtual fashion items as unequivocally \\u2018signed' and unique as tangible products, solving the problem of absolute reproducibility of digital\\u00a0clothes.\\u2022 With NFTs, the field of products that can be sold as unique is widened. A fashion brand could sell the video of its show or individual backstage photos as NFTs: there may be digital copies on YouTube, for example, but the NFT makes it possible to track down the original piece, which could therefore be purchased by a collector as an original work of\\u00a0art.\\u2022 They could be used to extend the value of physical products. They could therefore act as certificates of authenticity in the form of digital artwork to reinforce the uniqueness /scarcity of a product but also as a digital copy 'associated' with the physical product and therefore usable online for the avatars of a video\\u00a0game.\\u2022 NFT as certified could have an impact on the world of resell, not only by keeping an accurate map of the changes of ownership of a certain object but also, for example, by providing brands with a percentage of royalties every time their product is sold in the secondary luxury\\u00a0market.'Whilst sales of NFTs have fallen recently from the $2billion we witnessed in Q1 of 2021, we are equally seeing more global brands entering this sector and new NFT platforms being launched\\u200a\\u2014\\u200asuch as WENEW, founded by Beeples, who sold his NFT for $69million. WENEW is an NFT marketplace for the sports industry, history and pop culture and, to coincide with Wimbledon fortnight, it is launching NFTs around the tennis player Andy\\u00a0Murray.Interestingly, also of note is that while the Chinese have recently been clamping down on cryptos such as Bitcoin (by closing mining operations in China), according to Reuters they would appear to be encouraging NFTs\\u200a\\u2014\\u200acalling them Digital Art. Alipay, which is owned by the Chinese company, Ant Group, sold 16,000 NFTs at $1.52 each within hours. The NFT buyers of the image will appear whenever they use Alipay. If NFTs remain outside the scope of the crypto crackdown in China this ought to fuel the prices of NFTs globally only further. In June 2021, the BBC reported that there was a growing trend for the Chinese to be less conspicuous with their consumption and buying of luxury fashion brands. One wonders therefore, will Chinese buyers of physical luxury goods turn their buying power to digital goods such as\\u00a0NFTs?NFT's gathering momentum in the real and virtual worlds was originally published in DataDrivenInvestor on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"THE past 15 years have proved to be quite a bumpy ride for the country's automobile industry which has seen many ups and downs since the late 2000s. The last three years have been particularly bad for the industry which is undoubtedly one of the most protected sectors of the economy. Carmakers are often criticised for the high prices of vehicles and their poor quality and missing safety features, delayed deliveries, the exorbitant premium buyers are forced to pay and so on. Read: Carmakers delaying price relief despite duty, tax cut In their defence, the manufacturers have always blamed the massive government taxes that amount to over 40pc of the total price in certain cases and very low economies of scale as only 17 out of every 1,000 Pakistanis own a car compared to 77 in Indonesia, 281 in Thailand and 70 in India. The import of cheaper, used cars under various schemes for overseas Pakistanis is also said to have suffocated local car production. While the government has made the import of used cars difficult, it has significantly cut automobile taxes in the budget to bring down their prices. The assemblers have already responded to the initiative and revised down their prices, which is expected to push car sales in the country. The rest of the issues facing the industry, according to Industries Minister Khusro Bakhtiar, will be addressed in the new Automotive Industry Development and Export Policy 2021-26 to be announced next month. From the broader details given by the minister, the new policy can be expected to push car demand, create jobs across the supply chain, incentivise local assembly of environment-friendly hybrids, encourage localisation and value addition of parts used in car manufacturing and promote exports. Additionally, the new policy will address late delivery and high premiums, as well as force manufacturers to improve safety features. But what the proposed policy does not address is just as important, if not more. Although the cuts in tax have led to a significant decrease in prices, \\u2018entry level' small cars still remain outside the reach of first-time buyers hailing from middle-income groups. Likewise, it doesn't carry incentives for foreign carmakers to take steps for the localisation of more sophisticated engines and other hi-tech parts. Nor does it make clear if the consumers will have to pay extra for new safety features. Also, there is no compulsion for foreign carmakers to introduce their models in every engine size to create healthy competition in the market and give consumers more choices at affordable and competitive prices. The automotive industry can play a big part in growing an economy. But the government must ensure that the industry doesn't focus only on profits by catering to the needs of the moneyed segments only; the middle class should also be able to afford and enjoy a better ride.

      "      \"summary\": \"Auto sales in China fell 12.4% in June from the corresponding month a year earlier, industry data showed on Friday, as a global shortage of semiconductors hit autos production in the world's biggest car market. Automakers around the world have had to adjust assembly lines due to the auto-chip shortage, caused by manufacturing delays that some semiconductor makers blame on a faster-than-expected recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. China's overall sales stood at 2.02 million vehicles in June, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). The country sold 12.89 million vehicles between January and June, up 25.6% from year-ago levels. Chen Shihua, a senior official at CAAM, told an online press briefing that the global auto-chip supply shortage hit China's production hard last month, but given an overall economic recovery, CAAM is still moderately positive about domestic auto market. Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids, and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles maintained their strong momentum, jumping 139.3%, with 256,000 units sold last month. NEV makers such as Nio Inc, Xpeng Inc, and BYD are expanding manufacturing capacity in China, encouraged by the government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution. China's annual NEV sales are expected to grow more than 40% in the next five years, CAAM said last month. U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc sold 33,155 China-manufactured electric cars in June.

      "      \"summary\": \"(Photo : Pexels) President Joe Biden has set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 52 percent by 2030,\\u00a0according to The New York Times. As President Biden works on steering the U.S. towards a cleaner automobile sector and safe climate, he should ignore automakers' demands for less stringent emission and fuel efficiency rules. Instead, he should reimplement auto emissions for small vehicles, SUVs, and other light trucks to five percent annually, as directed under Obama's regulations. The president is aware that\\u00a0climate change is causing more infectious diseases\\u00a0to arise, not to mention intense drought and heat waves. And he can only achieve his goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 percent by setting strict standards for automakers to fight climate change. Below are ways the auto industry can reduce carbon emissions.\\u00a0 Speed up car electrification The auto sector aims to reduce fossil fuel consumption and carbon emission through car electrification. Over the past few years, electric vehicles have proven to be excellent solutions for minimizing the impacts of global warming and enhancing air quality. However, to ensure consumers enjoy the\\u00a0benefits electric cars offer, automakers should focus on electrifying the entire automobile fleet, from public buses to taxis. They should also aim to develop advanced vehicle charging infrastructures. Increase fuel efficiency Today's car buyers are keen to find fuel-efficient vehicles when\\u00a0evaluating features of different automobile models\\u00a0at auto shops. Ideally, consumers want cars that burn fuel more efficiently, resulting in fewer carbon emissions. Moreover, the government's clean air regulations require automakers to design vehicles that emit little to zero CO2. To meet these standards, carmakers should switch their focus to develop new engines with valves that help vehicles utilize fuel efficiently. Automakers have also embraced\\u00a0innovative tech and automobile designs\\u00a0to make the car lighter, improve fuel economy, and reduce carbon emissions.\\u00a0 Recycling materials In recent years, the auto industry has adapted green business strategies, such as recycling materials, choosing alternative fuels, and designing eco-friendly car parts. By recycling materials like plastic, aluminum, and steel, the auto industry can reduce its carbon footprint significantly. Even more appealing, most car makers have formed or joined green initiative programs to transform the auto sector into an eco-friendly industry.\\u00a0 Increasing climate change concerns have forced the government to increase pressure on carbon emitters to change their business practices. Given the auto industry accounts for the largest share of CO2 emissions, the government has imposed stern measures to ensure they reduce their carbon footprint. Currently, the auto industry is reducing carbon emissions by speeding car electrification, increasing fuel efficiency, and using recyclable materials.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"By News Desk ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday launched Pakistan's first locally-made electric motorcycle (e-bike) and said the government was working on setting out an 'eco-friendly roadmap' for Pakistan to save its future generations from the negative effects of climate change and global warming.'We will devise sustainable policies on environmental protection to materialise the vision of a clean and green Pakistan,' the Prime Minister said in his address at the launch of the e-bike, here at the lawns of the Prime Minister House.Manufactured by Pakistani company Jolta Electric, the e-bike is billed as a major step towards electrifying the country's automobile industry.The launch of e-bike was part of the government's five-year Pakistan Electric Vehicles Policy 2020-2025 approved last year envisaging an ambitious electric vehicle market with a 30 percent and 90 per cent share in passenger vehicles and heavy-duty trucks by 2030 and 2040, respectively.Khan said the governments of economically strong countries 'always work on long-term policies, rather than making decisions based on election-to-election strategy to gain votes and promote mafias'.'We have to take action today to resolve the upcoming challenges,' he said, adding that deforestation and pollution are man made problems that are leading to horrendous effects on human lives.He recalled that Lahore and Peshawar, once known as the cities of gardens, are now witnessing high levels of airborne toxins which could severely affect the health of a person 'by reducing his average age by 11 years'. The Prime Minister said the government's Electric Vehicle Policy would be export-orientated to encourage economic growth by using local raw materials to manufacture indigenous products. Besides being helpful in reducing pollution, he said, the electric vehicle sector would open up an entirely new sector in the country and generate employment opportunities.He lauded Jolta Electric Executive Director Dr Muhammad Amjad and the government's team for promoting the 'futuristic' and eco-friendly policies in the country.Minister for Industries Khusro Bakhtiar said Jolta Electric was the first to launch the initiative among three companies which were given licences by the government to manufacture electric two-wheelers. He expressed confidence that the electric vehicles sector would undergo growth in the near future and mentioned that 17 more companies had shown interest in such production.He said a regulatory framework would be outlined to manage the area of electric automobiles and the related charging infrastructure. He said Africa, Central Asia and Afghanistan would be target areas for Pakistan to sell its products in line with its auto-development and export policy.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"JULY 9, 2021 | NATIONAL SUGAR COOKIE DAY | COLLECTOR CAR APPRECIATION DAY\\n\\nNATIONAL SUGAR COOKIE DAY\\nObserved each year on July 9th, National Sugar Cookie Day honors the ever-popular and delicious sugar cookie.\\nA holiday favorite and very easy to make, sugar cookies disappear quickly once they come out of the oven. Most sugar cookies include sugar, flour, butter, eggs, vanilla, and either baking powder or baking soda. While most people have the ingredients on hand at all times, some of the ingredients should be fresh for the best outcome. Children enjoy baking and decorating anytime someone makes a batch of sugar cookies.\\nThe sugar cookie is believed to have originated in the mid-1700s in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. German Protestant settlers created a round, crumbly and buttery cookie that came to be known as the Nazareth Cookie.\\nToday, sugar cookie making and decorating has become an art form for kids and adults alike. Starting with the shape of the cookie, the dough is formed with either a cookie cutter or other methods of cutting and shaping the dough. Once the cookie is baked, the cookie artist adds colored frosting or icing. Sprinkles, edible glitter, colored sugars, and additional details may be added. Some cookies receive so much detail, it's almost a shame to eat them.\\u00a0\\nHOW TO OBSERVE #NationalSugarCookieDay\\nWhile making some delicious and beautiful sugar cookies, marvel at the skill of bakers who have mastered the skill. Learn some of their tips and tricks, or share your own. We even have a delicious\\u00a0sugar cookie\\u00a0recipe\\u00a0for you to try. For more recipes, be sure to visit the National Day Calendar\\u00ae\\u00a0recipe pages\\u00a0or share one of your own. Don't forget to give a shout-out to your favorite baker and let them know you appreciate their delicious cookies. Post on social media using #NationalSugarCookieDay.\\nNATIONAL SUGAR COOKIE DAY HISTORY\\nNational Day Calendar is researching the origins of this cookie holiday.\\u00a0However, the calendar is full of cookie celebrations! Won't you check them out?\\n\\nChocolate Chip Cookie Day\\nPecan Cookie Day\\nSpicy Hermit Cookie Day\\nGingerbread Cookie Day\\nOreo Cookie Day\\nLacy Oatmeal Cookie Day\\nOatmeal Cookie Day\\nPeanut Butter Cookie Day Each year in July we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day. This day recognizes the vital role automotive restoration and collection plays in American society.\\u00a0\\nAmericans have had a fascination with automobiles since the first U.S. horseless carriage was demonstrated in 1893 by the Duryea Motor Wagon Company. The romance of the motor took us from rough country roads to iconic highways and byways. We were also able to stretch our legs and cross the country more independently than ever before. The urge to go faster, fleeter and finer were inspirations for design and ingenuity. Additionally, assembly lines made cars more affordable.\\nThe appeal of the automobile influenced the American sense of adventure. Nostalgia, perseverance, and exploration are the topics of the day. Surprisingly, the automobile and the horse shared the road for a time causing much confusion. Stop signs and signal lights were non-existent. Rules of the road were not yet established. Still, motor companies began to tailor their designs to a public demanding a particular style.\\nToday, the collectors of these bygone eras keep history and memories alive. They restore and maintain old metal, engines, and blinkers. Crank, push-button, or throttle starters once rusting in a barn rev to life. Specialists take great care to find the right part or color, and skilled artists put their hard labor to work restoring a single collector car. They spend hours on end painting, repairing, rebuilding, and welding to recreate the final result of a pristine collector car.\\nThis day recognizes those individuals dedicated to preserving a piece of American history. We associate each era with a certain car. Whether we ride in a Prohibition-era Cadillac Sedan, a 1950s era muscle car, or in our grandfather's pickup truck, they take us back.\\nHOW TO OBSERVE #CarCollectorAppreciationDay\\nGive a shout out to a dedicated restorer you know. Recognize their talent and knowledge. Attend a collector car event or show. Share your tips and videos. While you're celebrating, take a ride in your classic car. Post photos of your collector car on social media using #CollectorCarAppreciationDay.\\nCAR COLLECTOR APPRECIATION DAY HISTORY\\nSince 2009, SEMA Action Network (SAN) has sponsored Collector Car Appreciation Day. Per the request of The SEMA Action Network (SAN), each year the U.S. Senate has passed a Resolution helping to launch the day. For more information visit\\u00a0www.semasan.com.\",\n",

Total vehicle retail for the month of June'21 rise by 22.62% YoY on a low base. When compared to June'19 (a regular pre-covid month), retails are still down by -28.32%. On YoY basis, all categories were in green with 2W up by 17%, 3W up by 22%, PV up by 43%, Tractor up by 14% and CV up by a massive 236% (on a very low base due to non-availability of BS-6 vehicles). Positive momentum from June carries forward to July. With Southern India opening up, we can expect further pickup in demand. While daily infection cases have been contained offering some respite from the debilitating second wave, however, the new virus mutants and the impending 3rd wave continue to pose as risks on a longer-term, FADA said in the note on Thursday. Commenting on how June'21 performed, FADA President, Mr. Vinkesh Gulati said, 'The month of June witnessed re-opening for most of the states except the ones in South. Due to this, the industry witnessed a high pent up demand which was stuck in the system because of statewide lockdowns. While all the categories were in green, Passenger Vehicles maintains to see good demand as customers continued to show keenness in vehicles for observing social distancing and safety of their families. Two Wheeler category though in green has witnessed a softer recovery as rural market is taking time to get back from post covid stress. Commercial vehicle segment has seen a staggering growth over last year, though on a very low base as there were product shortages due to BS-6 transition. Overall, the Industry is still not out of the woods. When compared to June'19, we are still in red by -28% with 3W and CVs taking the max hit as they are down by -70% and -45% respectively. Only Tractors continue to grow as it was up 27% compared to June'19. FADA is thankful to the Government of India and previous MSME Minister, Nitin Gadkari for bringing entire Auto Retail under the ambit of MSME. This will definitely help Auto Dealers in multiple ways, may it be lower cost of financing or lower utility rates to name a few. Positive momentum from June carry forwards to July. With southern India opening up, we can expect further pickup in demand. On a longer term, Auto Industry is yet to see retail numbers comparable to FY 19. Continued global semi-conductor shortage is impacting demand \\u2013 supply mis-match thus restricting the growth of Passenger Vehicles. On one hand, while the new virus mutants and a prediction of 3rd wave in August are effecting sentiments, the revival of monsoons in July after a pause of 2 weeks and a better vaccination drive rate continues to build some hope. We will therefore have to wait and watch how the overall economy shapes up over the next couple of months. We hence see demand to be a mixed bag and hope that recovery is back on track by the time Navratri and Diwali knocks our door. Inventory at the end of June'21 o Average inventory for Passenger Vehicles ranges from 30-35 days o Average inventory for Two \\u2013 Wheelers ranges from 20-25 days\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Directed by Steven Soderbergh; screenplay by Ed Solomon Steven Soderbergh's No Sudden Move, written by Ed Solomon, is a crime thriller set in Detroit in 1954. The movie's timeframe coincides with that period when the city was at the center of global automobile production and had reached its peak population, some two million people. The genre, the locale and the era are promising. Soderbergh had already made one relatively light-hearted film primarily set in the Detroit area, Out of Sight (1998). Perhaps the director would take a more serious look this time?The new work opens with a visually striking sequence in which Curt Goynes (Don Cheadle) ambles through a gray Detroit neighborhood. Just out of jail, Curt needs some fast money. A bulky Doug Jones (Brendan Fraser) offers the ex-con a considerable sum of cash for what appears to be a straightforward job.Curt becomes one member of a trio of masked men that also includes Ronald Russo (Benicio del Toro) and Charley (Kieran Culkin). Curt and Russo are assigned to watch the Wertz family at gunpoint, while patriarch Matt Wertz (David Harbour), a General Motors accountant, is forcibly escorted by Charley to retrieve documents from his boss's safe.When it emerges that the hostage situation is a set-up, Curt shoots Charley, soon realizing that he and Russo are pawns in a bigger game. Two rival mobs are involved\\u2014one black, led by Aldrick Watkins (Bill Duke), and the other headed by Italian-American Frank Capelli (Ray Liotta). The central characters replicate this divide: the soulful and relatively decent Curt makes a favorable contrast to the alcoholic, racist Russo.It takes the movie almost three-quarters of its running time to reveal a fact that will come as a shock to very few, that auto company executives are ruthless and corrupt. And furthermore, that they have police officers, such as Detective Joe Finney (Jon Hamm), in their pocket. Meanwhile, the audience is subjected to a convoluted plot that features cheating husbands, duplicitous wives and girlfriends, and gratuitous bloodshed.With stolen GM documents (blueprints for a catalytic converter, the antipollution device) in hand, Curt ultimately faces off with the head of the Consolidated Car Association, Mr. Big/Mike Lowen (Matt Damon), who coolly remarks that Curt, low man on the totem pole, has breached 'all laws of history, nature, class\\u2014no, caste' by confronting him.Undeterred, Curt upbraids Lowen and the car companies for leveling Black Bottom and Paradise Valley, 'entire neighborhoods [where] you tore up the trolley tracks and now you have this redlining bullshit everywhere. Where are the people supposed to live, Mike?' Earlier in the film the process of 'urban renewal' has been dubbed 'Negro removal.' (Black Bottom and Paradise Valley were both African-American communities in Detroit razed in the early 1960s.)Defending the theft of GM's blueprints for the pollution-reducing device, Mr. Big glibly asserts there is 'no conclusive evidence that the automobile has anything to do with the pollution level in Los Angeles, or in any other city on the planet for that matter.' A one-time executive at Ford, he complains that the latter auto giant was 'losing sales to GM. We, who invented the whole damn thing became the underdog\\u2026 'I and others like me did create these rules in this world,' Lowen goes on. 'It's money, and I have lots of money. I will continue to have more still. It's like a lizard's tail. Cut it off, the damn thing just grows back. I work, it grows. I sleep, it grows. In fact, however we end up here, I'll go home, I'll call my banker, and I will sleep like a baby tonight.' This is the most telling moment in No Sudden Move, but it does not carry a great deal of weight when the film is considered as a whole.A postscript informs us that 'in 1969, the Department of Justice filed an anti-trust case against GM, Ford, Chrysler and American Motors for 15 years of collusion to withhold the science of pollution-reducing technologies.'Auto manufacturers settled with the government and in 1976, the catalytic converter became mandatory equipment on all US automobiles. No fines were levied.' Is this then a happy ending? The problem of the film's essential thematic timidity and blandness finds expression as a triumph of style over substance. Much has been invested in creating the look, including costumes and interiors, appropriate to Detroit at the time. The opening credits pay attractive homage to the imposing, rolling credits of Hollywood films in the 1950s, backed by a soundtrack reminiscent of Henry Mancini's effort for Orson Welles' Touch of Evil (1958).But the actors find themselves at the mercy of an overly complicated and rather banal storyline, with many left to their own devices. In an interview with Esquire, Soderbergh referred to Detroit in terms that would gladden the heart of the local Chamber of Commerce and other 'boosters,' apparently bending over backward not to offend the city fathers and others who promote the falsehood that 'Detroit is back!'The filmmaker commented that the 'face of the city has changed drastically ... and [is] continuing now to go through more changes.' It's 'such a fascinating city. It's so emblematic of a certain kind of American city\\u2014one that can only exist in America. ... It's a big, sprawling city.'This is cotton candy, puffery. Detroit is ravaged, parts of it resembling a city devastated by military conflict: decaying neighborhoods, empty lots, abandoned and boarded-up buildings, closed businesses. That the filmmakers focus on catalytic converters already reduces a tragic social process to historical small change. In any event, car pollution continues to be one of the major causes of global warming, according to Sciencing website in 2018. Detroit symbolizes, above all, the long-term decline of American capitalism and its loss of global economic hegemony\\u2014and the relentless avarice of the financial aristocracy. In 1950, Detroit was the most prosperous city in the US on a per capita income basis. Today it is the poorest. Shouldn't that transition be of interest to a major filmmaker? Instead, in No Sudden Move, Soderbergh settles for creating an impressive image of one particular moment and milieu at the expense of a far fuller, richer, more contradictory picture. The decline in auto and other jobs has been a collapse. Between 1967 and 1982, Detroit lost more than half of its manufacturing jobs. Since 1989, auto-related employment in Michigan has fallen by 70 percent. Between 1950 and 2011, the number of manufacturing jobs in Detroit proper fell from 296,000 to 27,000. The city's traumatized population has paid a high price, in poverty, unemployment, homelessness, drug addiction, disease.Soderbergh continues to get many things right, except the truly important ones.

      "      \"summary\": \"Mint & Rose sandals. Mint & Rose Designers will be the first to admit the world doesn't need more brands\\u2014and yet we crave beautiful things that make us feel good, inside and out. As shoppers, we're always searching for our next go-t0, whether in fashion or beauty. That's why many brands today are choosing to make it all, creating a full lifestyle for their customers to dive into. These four companies are doing just that, by offering natural beauty products and apparel or accessories. Saie Saie was founded in 2019 to prove that makeup can be \\\"clean, cool and unforgettable,\\\" the brand's founder and CEO, Laney Crowell, said.\\u00a0 After Crowell left her job as a fashion editor at Est\\u00e9e Lauder, she started a blog where she wrote about health, wellness and clean beauty. She was constantly testing out products, and over time she realized there was a big gap in the color market for \\\"clean products that were high performing but also had chic, fashionable branding, weren't too expensive and were thoughtful about sustainability,\\\" she said.\\u00a0 Saie Sun Melt. Saie After having many conversations with her social media followers\\u2014who were also seeking cute, affordable and clean products\\u2014she launched Saie with the mission to change the way people approach beauty. \\\"I have always been super conscious about what I put in my body and wanted to be just as sure of what I was putting on my body,\\\" she said. \\\"I was detoxing in every area of my life\\u2014nutrition, meditation and eventually beauty\\u2014but makeup was just so far behind. I didn't want anyone to have to choose between clean makeup they should buy and the cool makeup they want to buy. I wanted to create a world where both could exist.\\\" Due to her fashion background, she has also always paid close attention to style, so she said it is very important to her that Saie has chic design and packaging that makes shoppers excited to see the products in their makeup bags. Saie Sun Melt. Saie It's because of that that she decided to offer Saie merch, such as a makeup bag in the brand's signature lilac, a tote and the Saie\\u00a0x JOON lilac face mask, which is their elegant, sustainable spin on what has now become a wardrobe staple. Apart from its beautiful color, texture and design, what's great about the silky mask is it doesn't smudge your Saie makeup, not even the new super creamy Sun Melt bronzer which the team just launched to give customers that deep summer glow.\\u00a0 \\\"Beyond good makeup, we wanted to promote a good lifestyle and brand. The merchandise we offer is a reflection of that,\\\" Crowell said.\\u00a0 Mr. Smith Mr. Smith launched on November 1, 2015, in Australia, and is now available in over 10 countries across the globe. Founder David Justin said he started the brand because he wanted to develop a hair care line that reflected his own personal values: something he would feel comfortable using on himself, that was ethical, sustainable, clean and aesthetically pleasing.\\u00a0 Mr. Smith backpack. Mr. Smith \\\"Being Australian made and owned we are lucky enough to have access to a vast selection of beautiful ingredients and it would be naive of us not to capitalize on this opportunity,\\\" Justin said, speaking of his commitment to natural products. \\\"It is really important for us to know where ingredients are coming from so we can stand by their quality.\\\" The Mr. Smith team is currently in the process of setting up their own ingredients farm and growing facility in Melbourne's Mornington Peninsula. Mr. Smith hair care. Mr. Smith Apart from shampoos, hair masks and hair pigments, the brand also sells backpacks, travel totes bag and reusable shopping totes.\\u00a0 \\\"Selling merchandise is very important, as it creates a connection between the client and the brand. As a consumer myself, I love to support the brands I use in many ways, so having high-quality merchandise, such as tote bags, bandanas and toiletry bags, is very important,\\\" Justin said.\\u00a0 Mr. Smith tote bag. Mr. Smith The founder said he often takes inspiration from what he sees coming off the runways\\u2014from the hairstyles, the hair length, cut and color, to the products used. He and his teammates are also constantly taking notes on fashion industry trends and listening to customer feedback. Soon, they hope to introduce more fashion products to support their beauty launches.\\u00a0 Mint & Rose Created in California in early 2012, Mint & Rose's philosophy has always been clear: offer impeccable craftsmanship, top-quality materials, Mediterranean-inspired designs and locally-made products. Mint & Rose orange seed oil. Mint & Rose \\u00a0\\\"If we have learned something from the past year, it is that sometimes we have to slow down our pace of life a bit, stop, breathe and think,\\\" the Mint & Rose team said. \\\"Taking care of ourselves inside and out and choosing high-quality products that are as natural as possible goes along this line.\\\" Mint & Rose sandals. Mint & Rose It's because of that, they said, that they decided to increase the brand's product range and offer their community a \\\"more complete Mediterranean lifestyle.\\\" Mint & Rose orange seed oil. Mint & Rose They now offer apparel, shoes, bags, accessories and beauty products. Their most recent launch included three body oils, a hand cream and two different scented candles\\u2014all made in Spain, like their coveted espadrilles. \\\"Taking care of yourself on the inside,\\\" the team said, \\\"is also closely related to the type of products you choose to wear on the outside.\\\" Bella Skin Beauty Bella Skin Beauty founders Diana Shneider\\u00a0and Alexandra Bella just launched a cozy waffle robe made out of 100% cotton to complement their all-natural beauty line. The mother-daughter duo\\u2014known for their luxurious body oils, serums, toners, face scrubs and more\\u2014said they created the robe because they wanted their customers to have a real at-home spa\\u00a0experience. After all, the two created their company in 2019 in order to detox their bodies after Shneider suffered from health issues for years, so full-body wellness has always been top of mind. Bella Skin Beauty waffle robe. Bella Skin Beauty \\\"We want every customer to feel like they are experiencing something wonderful while using clean beauty,\\\" they said.\\u00a0 Shneider and Bella debuted the robe earlier this month and have already gotten wonderful feedback from shoppers who said their skin care routines were enhanced by it. And because they want to keep offering their customers an entire beauty experience, the founders said they are looking to introduce more loungewear and merchandise. \\\"Here at Bella Skin Beauty we absolutely\\u00a0believe that beauty and fashion go hand in hand. Both beauty and fashion are powerful categories that help us look and feel more confident,\\\" they said, adding that they want to do everything they can to make their customers \\\"feel the power of clean beauty and beautiful fashion.\\\"\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Eric Adams\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nThe Democrats have a problem:\\u00a0They have run away from their core voters.\\u00a0And they are beginning to notice and worry.\\n\\n\\n\\nLefty blogger Kevin Drum noted this recently. He observes that Republicans have moved slightly to the right, but Democrats have moved way, way to the left on social issues.\\n\\n\\n\\nDrum says he is 'personally happy' about the Democrats' move left. But he is worried, because while the Democratic Party has moved hard left, the voters it relies on to attain power haven't.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nThus, in the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump \\u2014 despite being called a white supremacist and a Hispanic-hater by all the mainstream media \\u2014 picked up black and Hispanic votes.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne reason for this is that racial polarization went down, but 'education polarization' went up.\\u00a0The Democrats are increasingly the party of the college- and graduate-school-educated white gentry class. The Republicans are increasingly the party of the working class, which includes a lot of . . . blacks and Hispanics.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust look at the issues the Democrats are pushing:\\u00a0defunding the police, which hurts mostly poor and working-class neighborhoods; critical race theory, which mostly interests woke white activists (and rich-and-guilty Dem donors) but which actually sends a message of inferiority to minority youths; gender ideology, which plays less well among the more traditional and more religious working-class minorities; environmental policies that produce higher gas prices and lower employment, while pushing food prices up; open borders that drive down wages for downscale workers;\\u00a0and so on.\\n\\n\\n\\nDonors and activists love this stuff. They live in neighborhoods that are mostly insulated from urban crime and disorder.\\u00a0Their kids will still be privileged, regardless of what theories on race are popular. Transgender issues make them feel hip and cutting-edge. Higher gas and food prices won't affect them.\\u00a0And illegal immigration makes sure they don't have to pay too much for a nannies and gardeners.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a long time, the Democrats were able to have it both ways, pretending solidarity with the working class while promoting policies that undercut it.\\u00a0But they have overdone things, and now people have noticed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe voting shift of 2020, they fear, was just the beginning.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn example is the recent Democratic Party primary in New York City, where Eric Adams triumphed over more radical opponents. In most cities Adams would be a lefty himself, but these days, simply opposing crime and disorder is enough to get you tarred as a 'conservative.'\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nAdams lost in Manhattan, the wealthiest and whitest borough in New York. He won in all the others. His support came from the working class.\\u00a0As journalist Michael Tracey tweeted, 'It's so funny that an alliance of the New York Post, ethnic whites and outer-borough blacks was the winning formula for the New York City mayoral race.'\\n\\n\\n\\nOr as Adams himself put it: 'This wasn't simply a campaign, it was a five-borough movement of working-class New Yorkers coming together for a safer, stronger, healthier city.'\\n\\n\\n\\nA safer, stronger, healthier city \\u2014 and for that matter, a safer, stronger and healthier America \\u2014 is what most voters want. It's just not what the Democrats' activist core wants.\\u00a0Otherwise, the Democrats would be supporting policies that would produce that result.\\n\\n\\n\\nThings like controlling street crime, homelessness, public defecation and drug use, etc. used to be no-brainers for politicians. How many voters, after all, are in favor of those things?\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in Mayor Bill De Blasio's New York, and in the Democrats' version of America generally, those things aren't priorities. Heck, they're not really even goals.\\n\\n\\n\\nVoters are pushing back, in the Big Apple and across the country.\\u00a0Democrats are on the defensive, going so far as to try to deny that they supported things like defunding the police, or teaching critical race theory in schools. But voters aren't that dumb.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the GOP is smart \\u2014 I know, a big if \\u2014 it will run on these issues.\\u00a0Give the voters what they want: An idea so crazy, it just might work.\",\n",

Dr SK Tan, founder of IDS Clinic, an aesthetics clinic, says it may be better to call them skin supplements, as they 'usually contain antioxidants or vitamins shown to benefit skin'. These include photo-protection, skin barrier repair and, sometimes, skin brightening. Co-founder of supplement brand Miriqa, Winthrop Wong, who is also a pharmacist and director of Wellchem Pharmaceuticals, says supplements can benefit your beauty routine. 'The health of our skin and hair is a reflection of our diet, and inadequate intake of certain nutrients may affect our hair and skin.' Sounds good \\u2013 but isn't your daily serum or moisturiser enough? Wong says this 'dual approach' gives your skin 'optimal benefits': Apply skincare on the surface and, from the inside, supplement skin with what your body lacks from your diet. And while some ingredients do get destroyed in the stomach before they reach the intestines where they can be absorbed, here's where R&D comes in. 'Dosage of the ingredients matters,' says Wong. Two brands might use the same ingredients, but the concentration might be far more optimal in one than the other. So check the ingredients list \\u2013 the one with the higher concentration will be listed higher up. Dr Tan says you can also look out for ingredients that help with absorption, such as black pepper extract (piperine), found in IDS Lyco-White Ultra skin supplements. The patented ingredient is 'suitable for improving gastrointestinal absorption', and encourages the total use of the nutrients in the formula. Some sceptics may ask: Why can't I take multivitamins instead? Theoretically, you could. But Wong says it depends on the type of antioxidants used, how well it gets absorbed, and if it has clinically proven results. Take Miriqa Hair. It uses tripeptide collagen, which has a molecular weight small enough to be easily absorbed by the body, while Miriqa Skin uses tomatoes with colourless carotenoids, which have been backed by clinical studies as potent antioxidants for the skin. Whether you choose capsule, powder or liquid form, it doesn't matter as Dr Tan says the difference in absorption rates aren't significant. And more is not merrier either, he says. Pick what you need based on your main concerns. Wong adds that while most supplements can be taken together, some may have overlapping ingredients. To ensure that the combination stays within safe limits, check with your doctor or use the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) as a guide. New beauty supplements to try These six options feed your skin, hair and nails. Miriqa Skin contains antioxidants from non-GMO tomatoes, olive extract and l-cysteine to brighten and protect skin, while reducing flare-ups. Miriqa Hair contains tripeptide collagen, tocotrienol, biotin, saw palmetto berries and keratin forte to improve hair health. At www.miriqa.com 2.

      "      \"summary\": \"July 09, 2021published at 4:57 AMByPei YingRenonation.sg The minimalist style, while somewhat off the radar in the interior design scene for a while, is now back on trend. And homes in Singapore have embraced it more than ever. Sometimes surreal, often serene, but always stylish, minimalist homes are the answer to our very hectic and cluttered lives. They may look easy to design, but a well-thought-out minimalist sanctuary requires plenty of attention to details. We seek out some of the best, highlighting the details that have gone into the design of these minimalist homes. 1. Bishan Apartment by D' Initial Concept Design highlights : White plastered walls with recessed shelving in the living room and the bedroom offer display and storage space. Minimalist design, but making a strong visual statement with curves and arches. You see it in the arches to break up the lines in the communal areas, customised curved doors, the curved kitchen peninsula counter, the curved-edge shoe cabinet bench, and the curved privacy screen in the bedroom. Unlike the rest of the spaces, which come with screed-like flooring, the kitchen features wood flooring to warm things up in the cooking space. Textiles and a gorgeous solid wood dining table were used to create warmth in the rest of the space. 2. Sumang Walk Apartment by The Local Inn.terior Design highlights : Lots of cleverly hidden lighting to create mood, design interest and warmth in this neutral-hued home. Our favourite has to be the hallway's recessed lights and the foyer's concealed lighting. Concealed storage panels near the entrance of the home to hide away clutter and everyday life. The TV wall, with the TV and media units recessed, features a curved element to break up the expected. A dedicated vanity space concealed within the walk-in wardrobe in the master bedroom. 3. Bukit Panjang Apartment by In-Expat Design highlights : A monochrome theme, the epitome of minimalism. The dining space is defined by swathing the nearby walls black. Thanks to its location near the window, this eating area doesn't feel too closed in or dark. Wood floors and furniture, greenery and leather furniture bring a sense of nature into the home. Metallic finishes throughout the flat lend a sense of opulence. Worthy of note are the custom wardrobe handles as well as the painted glass kitchen backsplash. ALSO READ:\\u00a07 luxe minimalist homes in Singapore that we wish were ours 4. Yishun Apartment by Kuro+Kagi Design highlights : Rather than interpret minimalism as an absence of colour, this designer made use of warm and subtle hues, including olive, navy and mustard, to enliven this minimalist space. Wood was also predominantly used amidst the white foundation to create textural interest and to bring in warmth. Recessed shelves in the living room feature a wood base to draw parallels to the wood-clad built-in storage located next to them. Floors are cement screed for a pared-back look. In the bedroom, the bed sits atop a wooden platform that features a lean table by the side to serve as a nightstand and a casual workstation. Rather than opt for off-the-rack pulls or knobs, the cabinet and wardrobe handles were specially designed and crafted from the same carpentry work in line with the minimalist style. 5. Bukit Panjang Apartment by Authors Interior & Styling Design highlights : Using light woods and white to bring about a soothing atmosphere to this home. The kitchen cabinet handles were designed to run the length of the cabinet so they appear like an extra design detail rather than a handle. Part of the island features fluted details for extra interest. The edge is carved out as legroom in order to provide a comfortable spot for casual dining. A hefty marble grain vanity offers a sense of luxury amidst the black-and-white bathroom. 6. Henderson Apartment by Van Hus Interior Design Design highlights : In the living room, the study is enclosed behind full glass panels. The black borders offer extra support for safety without impeding the sleek appearance. A granite backsplash pops against the chic, all-black kitchen. This style is similarly replicated in the bathroom, with the marble grain vanity counter as well as the recessed shower shelves. Long strips of LED lights are found throughout the home, lending form as much as function. The built-in wardrobe is embedded with an ironing board, making it extra convenient to stow away clothes after ironing. The wardrobe also features a vertical strip of open compartments for displaying the homeowner's collection of designer bags. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Feel comfy and productive at home with these minimalist 'infit' picks 7. Apartment by The Association Design highlights : To make the entrance into the bedroom less jarring in the living room, the door was made to blend in with the fluted TV feature wall. This was similarly done for the common bathroom entrance in the kitchen. A variety of wood tones and textures were used to avoid a monotonous look in the apartment. The kitchen is a minimalist, sleek space, with a single island dominating the area. The full-height storage, concealed home bar and pantry (behind pocket doors) and the built-in appliances keep it looking neat and clutter-free. Fluted details appear once again in the bathroom, standing out against the concrete-like tiles. A petite workstation was designed at the end of the built-in wardrobe in the bedroom.

      "      \"summary\": \"Buying a pre-owned car is a rational choice in the face of Singapore's high car prices, but doing so is not without its pitfalls.\\u00a0 Second-hand cars are a perfectly viable (some say sensible) route to car ownership in Singapore.\\u00a0 Not only can you get a vehicle that's in good working condition, you can also avoid the dreaded depreciation, which is most pronounced during the first or first two years of the vehicle's lifespan.\\u00a0 And all that at a fraction of the price too! Another reason to buy second-hand: It allows you to get the car you want at a discount, which means you might be able to afford a pre-owned version of that high-end sports car you've been lusting after.\\u00a0 You can also think of it as taking over a vehicle that has been 'battle-tested' by the previous owner, with all the kinks worked out.\\u00a0 While it's an attractive concept (especially given the sky-high car prices in Singapore), buying second-hand cars isn't completely without its pitfalls. Here's what you need to know about buying a second-hand car in Singapore.\\u00a0\\u00a0 What to look out for when buying a second-hand car How old is the car? COEs in Singapore last 10 years, so the vast majority of pre-owned cars are somewhere in that age range. When choosing a used car, you'll want to go with the Goldilocks option \\u2013 not too new, and not too old either. [[nid:500047]] Newer used cars (in the one- to two-year-old range) tend to command a higher price, as their owners will try to bank on the fact that they're still 'new', and that the vehicle is still in perfect working condition.\\u00a0 Cars that are approaching the end of their COE period, on the other hand, (i.e., seven years or older) will have prices that are more reflective of their lifespan, which you may find more palatable. However, depending on the car's mileage and usage history, you could find yourself facing an unexpected issue, and having to spend extra money to get it fixed.\\u00a0 Hence, as a general rule, cars that are sitting in the three to seven years old bracket are generally favoured by second-hand drivers.\\u00a0 What's the mileage of the car?\\u00a0 If the age of the car speaks to its outer aesthetics, then the mileage is all about its condition under the hood.\\u00a0 Mileage tells you how many kilometres the car has been driven, which gives you an idea of the wear and tear suffered by its engine and internal components. This metric, coupled with the maintenance and servicing history (see next point), will help you decide if the asking price is worth it.\\u00a0 The car's mileage is just as important as its registration date (some would say even more so). Afterall, a five-year-old car that spends most of its time sitting pretty in the owner's garage is likely to be in better condition than a three-year-old one that has covered every single road and expressway in Singapore multiple times over. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Tips to get the best price when selling your car to used car dealers! What's the servicing history? Car manufacturers have a recommended schedule for servicing their vehicles, which may be based on mileage or time elapsed. (For example, it's good to change your engine oil every 10,000 km or twice a year).\\u00a0 Hence, when considering a used car, it's good to check on its servicing history, based on its age and mileage. If the frequency of the servicing deviates too far, it could be a cause for concern. Also, pay attention to the maintenance and service reports for the vehicle. If you see a repeated pattern of fixes for a particular issue, there's a chance you might have to confront the same problem somewhere down the road. (Or, you know, go on a gremlin-hunting mission.) What are the accident records (if any)?\\u00a0\\u00a0 The seller may understandably be reluctant to share such information with you, but it's important to know if the vehicle you're considering for purchase had been in an accident before. Knowing the full facts can help you avoid purchasing a problematic car.\\u00a0 If you find the owner or dealer being less than forthcoming, try checking insurance records for a fuller picture.\\u00a0 ALSO READ:\\u00a0https://www.asiaone.com/lifestyle/used-car-buying-guide-singapore-where-buy-and-what-check What do the warning lights say? Another often overlooked source to check is the car's dashboard panel.\\u00a0 Such panels are designed to provide status updates to important car components at a glance, so you might be tempted to give it just the quick once-over.\\u00a0 However, doing so may cause you to miss noticing any missing or blinking lights \\u2013 which could be a clue telling you there's something about the car you need to pay attention to.\\u00a0 5 popular used car brands and models in Singapore Brand and model Engine capacity\\u00a0 Selling price* Depreciation (per year) Honda Fit 1.3L A 1.3 L $47,000 (approx. three years old)\\u00a0 $6,746 Volkswagen Scirocco GP 1.4 TSI 1.4 L $56,000 (approx. six years old $11,084 Honda Civic 1.6A VTI 1.6 L $66,880 (approx. five years old) $10,860 Nissan X-trail 2.0 CVT 4WD 2.0 L $72,800 (approx. 4.5 years old) $11,338\\u00a0 Mercedes Benz SLK 200 Kompressor A 1.8 L $76,000 (approx. two years old) $9,413 1. Honda Fit 1.3L A A sporty hatchback known for its compact size and nimble handling, the Honda Fit is a popular choice among many Singaporean families.\\u00a0 This is surely due to its generous storage capacity belying its small form, which can be further enhanced by its multiple seating configurations. A great choice whether you're looking to pack your buddies in for a road trip or to ferry a multi-generational household around. 2. Volkswagen Scirocco GP 1.4 TSI\\u00a0 The Volkswagen Scirocco GP 1.4 TSI features a supercharged engine, 7-speed gearbox and smooth power delivery, befitting its status as a budget-friendly racer.\\u00a0 This updated model also has the stylings to fit its sporty ambitions, with gauges that sit in individual binnacles, and auxiliary meters for boost pressure, elapsed time and oil temperature that is sure to get the Fast and Furious crew breathing heavy. Adding to the sleekness are the redesigned air-con vents, which now sit flush with the dashboard. Tasteful use of metal applique adds a dynamic flourish to complete the look. If you've been wanting to get behind the wheels of a sports racer, but can't quite bear to pay full price, this second-hand model should make for a satisfying compromise. 3. Honda Civic 1.6A VTI Another popular car among Singaporean drivers is the Honda Civic, which has long captured imaginations for being a mid-sized sedan with power to spare. The 1.6A VTI variant however wins fans for another reason: it's built more for sensible driving rather than full-throttle action, but in return, rewards with great fuel economy somewhere in the range of 15km per litre.\\u00a0 A fun family vehicle that offers fuel efficiency underneath that trademark Civic look. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Why I bought a car in Singapore: What every first-time car buyer should know 4. Nissan X-trail 2.0 CVT 4WD The Nissan X-trail is a well-rounded SUV with plenty of storage and seating, equally comfortable prowling the city streets, or exploring wild terrain.\\u00a0\\u00a0 It has an optional third-row, which means it can seat up to seven people comfortably and safely, or transport large amounts of cargo. Meanwhile, its four-wheel-drive capabilities offer smoothness, power and control even in off-road conditions. An SUV made for those who work in the city but are prone to impromptu road trips once the weekend approaches.\\u00a0\\u00a0 5. Mercedes Benz SLK 200 Kompressor A As noted in the opening of this article, one of the biggest reasons to buy a second-hand car is the chance to drive a model that would otherwise be out of your price range.\\u00a0 If you've always wanted a top-tier luxury vehicle, why not consider a pre-owned Mercedes Benz SLK 200 Kompressor A? The vehicle's trademark exaggerated bonnet evokes jet-fighter vibes, which is a fitting motif for the top-of-the-world feeling you'll get when you drive off with a pre-owned model at a fraction of the original selling price. Whichever model you go for, if you're ready to take the plunge on a second-hand car, be sure to keep yourself and your car protected with a reliable car insurance plan.

      "      \"summary\": \"With a career spanning over two decades, Belinda Lee has captured the hearts of many Singaporeans with her work as a host and actress. Her most notable works are infotainment shows such as Find Me a Singaporean and Renovaid where she wasn't afraid to get herself dirty to uncover stories of people around the world, especially those who are in less fortunate circumstances. Beyond her professional life, Belinda spreads positivity on social media, and is a champion for social and humanitarian causes, further fuelling her likeability. In celebration of her 44th birthday on July 8, here are 10 lessons we can learn from Belinda on love and life. 1. Don't give up on love [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B4LzYe5g0lE/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] If you didn't know, Belinda got hitched on October 27, 2019, to American architect David Moore. Prior to her marriage, Belinda was engaged for six years before the relationship concluded in 2011. Faced with such a predicament, Belinda revealed in a 2019 interview with Jade Seah that she was disheartened to find love and even swore off marriage and dating. Still staying hopeful, however, Belinda eventually met David at church camp. They got married a year later. On the relationship with David, Belinda said that 'all the waiting for my soulmate was worth it. It is never too late to discover love.' 2. Love sees no boundaries [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B4q8cJVAI20/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Being with someone over a decade older than you can lead to people talking and making unnecessary comments on the relationship \\u2013 and Belinda has bore the brunt of such judgments. This was revealed in a 2021 interview with Phyllis Quek, who coincidentally also a married Caucasian man with the same name and is over a decade older than her. Both stressed that the age and nationality differences were never factors that affected their relationships, and that chemistry was paramount. Belinda added that David was 'one of the biggest blessings in her life'. In a separate interview, David credited Belinda as the one who helped him heal from his late wife's passing. 3. Live life on your own terms [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CCTJKGcAFpi/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] In this day and age, unfortunately, there are still pressures for women to get married and have kids. Judgments are often cast on those who don't conform. Belinda isn't excused from such pressures and judgments too. On the issue of having children now that she's married, Belinda's answer is simple: 'If a baby comes along, you know, I'm very open to the idea of anything, so it's fine as well for us. There are also lots of other children out there in the world who need love and care, and we are also open to the idea of caring for other children.' 4. You don't have to overshare your relationship [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Y2XEyAgOJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] It sometimes seems as though everyone is posting everything about their lives on social media and you may feel pressured to do the same. Being a public personality, the same pressure felt by Belinda could be many times stronger. The couple, however, has chosen to keep their relationship low-profile, adding that 'we felt that we could really have a very wonderful and healthy, honest relationship, just like everyone else, without having the public speculate about it.' 5. Give back whenever you can [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B3RMhz1AZur/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Fronting shows such as Find Me A Singaporean and Renovaid, Belinda has cultivated an on-screen reputation as being a humanitarian. Did you know that off-screen, Belinda was named a Goodwill Ambassador of World Vision Singapore? On this nod, Belinda stated that the nod reflected her wish 'to give back and to speak out for the voiceless'. Her compassion extends beyond humans too. Her late dog Man Man was adopted from a pet shelter where Belinda later nursed her back to health. Man Man, unfortunately, succumbed to cancer weeks before Belinda's wedding. She was slated to be the ring bearer and the wedding venue was even chosen as it was pet-friendly. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Life 401: Quan Yi Fong shares 4 enlightening words of wisdom 6. Radiate positivity as much as you can [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CQpnkEDrX1J/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Belinda published a book titled Larger Than Life: Celebrating The Human Spirit that delved into the touching stories and inspiring people she has met while filming Find Me A Singaporean. She later shared in 2015 to The New Paper that one of the reasons for publishing the book was that 'there are enough negative reports in this world now. I think people need to hear positive, uplifting stories that will restore their faith in humanity.' In fact, scroll through Belinda's Instagram and you'll find her sharing uplifting messages, quotes and captions to her followers. This post, for example, is accompanied with the caption: 'Sending you positive thoughts and vibes to kickstart start your week right! Stay happy, peaceful, healthy and kind always!\\ud83e\\udde1' 7. Find meaning in what you do [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BhZH-lpl_U5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Prior to joining Mediacorp in 2002, Belinda was the first MTV Asia VJ from Singapore. During that stint where she rubbed shoulders and interviewed major stars such as Andy Lau and Aaron Kwok, Belinda professed that 'I could interview the biggest star and come home feeling empty because I felt like that wasn't enough. I didn't find any meaning in it.' She later realised that the party girl lifestyle that she was leading, while seemingly glamorous on the outside, was not giving her meaning and purpose in life, and left her in a constant search of discovering who she is. This brings us to the next point\\u2026 8. Step out of your comfort zone [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CNhJvl7AOnf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Later, Belinda joined Mediacorp and was with them till her departure in 2016. In the introduction of Larger Than Life, Belinda shared that while her career with Mediacorp was initially 'exciting and new', she felt 'sad and a little empty' as she wasn't fulfilling her deeper purpose. She added in the interview with Phyllis Quek that she reached a point in her life where she gained self-awareness on what worked and made her happy, and what did not. As such, she decided to leave, despite some protests, to 'find a happier self' while gaining control of what projects she could work on. Belinda concluded that she is very happy with the decision to leave her comfort zone. In short, Belinda stresses the importance of finding happiness and meaning in what you do, even if it means leaving your comfort zone to seek it out. 9. Appreciate what you have [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BudwPpogT4U/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] Living in Singapore, we tend to travel to places with similar conditions for comfort and familiarity, with cities such as Tokyo and Taipei being popular choices. Belinda, on the other hand, has travelled the world, going into areas such as slums and rural villages where she met with people of different backgrounds living in a wide range of conditions. In a 2017 interview with The New Paper where she recounted various cherished travel memories, Belinda imparted this nugget of wisdom: 'Be open-minded and stop complaining, because once you step out of Singapore, everywhere will smell, look and feel differently.' Belinda encourages people to 'go off the beaten track', to enjoy what the world has to offer, free of judgments, and have fun. 10. Your self-worth is not dependent on your job title [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CMOkDfIgDLD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] In a competitive, meritocratic society like Singapore, we can easily be caught up in comparing and competing for careers, income and status levels with our peers. Belinda, however, believes the contrary that your job title shouldn't matter. She shared that her travels 'taught me that whether you are a cleaner, a teacher or a caretaker, it's not about how much you earn, it's about how much value there is in your job.'

      "      \"summary\": \"The Democrats have a problem:\\u00a0They have run away from their core voters.\\u00a0And they are beginning to notice and worry. Lefty blogger Kevin Drum noted this recently. He observes that Republicans have moved slightly to the right, but Democrats have moved way, way to the left on social issues.\\nDrum says he is 'personally happy' about the Democrats' move left. But he is worried, because while the Democratic Party has moved hard left, the voters it relies on to attain power haven't.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nThus, in the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump \\u2014 despite being called a white supremacist and a Hispanic-hater by all the mainstream media \\u2014 picked up black and Hispanic votes.\\nOne reason for this is that racial polarization went down, but 'education polarization' went up.\\u00a0The Democrats are increasingly the party of the college- and graduate-school-educated white gentry class. The Republicans are increasingly the party of the working class, which includes a lot of . . . blacks and Hispanics.\\nJust look at the issues the Democrats are pushing:\\u00a0defunding the police, which hurts mostly poor and working-class neighborhoods; critical race theory, which mostly interests woke white activists (and rich-and-guilty Dem donors) but which actually sends a message of inferiority to minority youths; gender ideology, which plays less well among the more traditional and more religious working-class minorities; environmental policies that produce higher gas prices and lower employment, while pushing food prices up; open borders that drive down wages for downscale workers;\\u00a0and so on.\\nDonors and activists love this stuff. They live in neighborhoods that are mostly insulated from urban crime and disorder.\\u00a0Their kids will still be privileged, regardless of what theories on race are popular. Transgender issues make them feel hip and cutting-edge. Higher gas and food prices won't affect them.\\u00a0And illegal immigration makes sure they don't have to pay too much for a nannies and gardeners.\\nFor a long time, the Democrats were able to have it both ways, pretending solidarity with the working class while promoting policies that undercut it.\\u00a0But they have overdone things, and now people have noticed.\\nThe voting shift of 2020, they fear, was just the beginning.\\nAn example is the recent Democratic Party primary in New York City, where Eric Adams triumphed over more radical opponents. In most cities Adams would be a lefty himself, but these days, simply opposing crime and disorder is enough to get you tarred as a 'conservative.'\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nAdams lost in Manhattan, the wealthiest and whitest borough in New York. He won in all the others. His support came from the working class.\\u00a0As journalist Michael Tracey tweeted, 'It's so funny that an alliance of the New York Post, ethnic whites and outer-borough blacks was the winning formula for the New York City mayoral race.'\\nOr as Adams himself put it: 'This wasn't simply a campaign, it was a five-borough movement of working-class New Yorkers coming together for a safer, stronger, healthier city.'\\nA safer, stronger, healthier city \\u2014 and for that matter, a safer, stronger and healthier America \\u2014 is what most voters want. It's just not what the Democrats' activist core wants.\\u00a0Otherwise, the Democrats would be supporting policies that would produce that result.\\nThings like controlling street crime, homelessness, public defecation and drug use, etc. used to be no-brainers for politicians. How many voters, after all, are in favor of those things?\\nBut in Mayor Bill De Blasio's New York, and in the Democrats' version of America generally, those things aren't priorities. Heck, they're not really even goals.\\nVoters are pushing back, in the Big Apple and across the country.\\u00a0Democrats are on the defensive, going so far as to try to deny that they supported things like defunding the police, or teaching critical race theory in schools. But voters aren't that dumb.\\nIf the GOP is smart \\u2014 I know, a big if \\u2014 it will run on these issues.\\u00a0Give the voters what they want: An idea so crazy, it just might work.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Italian fashion house Fendi used soft colours and marbleised patterns for its haute couture collection on Thursday, presenting a line of luxurious gowns and outfits. Designer Kim Jones said he looked to late Italian film director Pier Paolo Pasolini's depictions of Rome, where Fendi is based, for inspiration. He presented the line digitally with a film by Italian director Luca Guadagnino. Models including Kate Moss and her daughter Lila Grace wore embroidered dresses, satin gowns in marbleised prints, embellished jackets and mosaic-like designs. Netflix expands deal with 'Bridgerton' producer Shonda Rhimes \\\"Pasolini observed Rome become modern - and that is what is interesting to me: connecting eras, the old with the new, the past with the present,\\\" Jones said in a statement. \\\"Rome is a fascinating city because it has so many pasts.\\\"The British designer stuck to a mainly neutral colour palette, showing plenty of white, cream and shades of brown for his second couture collection at Fendi, which is known for its fur designs. Models also wore strapless see-through gowns with embroidered florals, ruffled frocks, short lace dresses, printed coats and trouser suits adorned with acorn depictions. One voluminous dress in soft grey was adorned in floating feathers, while other evening looks included sparkly sequined creations. Jones, also at the helm of menswear at French fashion house Dior, is artistic director for womenswear and couture at Fendi, part of luxury conglomerate LVMH. Red Notice: Netflix announces release date of its biggest movie ever featuring Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot He works alongside the founding family's scion Silvia Venturini Fendi, who looks after menswear and accessories. While haute couture week has seen the return of in-person shows as lockdown restrictions ease in France, some brands, like Fendi, have opted for digital presentations.\",\n",

Six am to 10 am is \\u2018Kapha' time and the energy is ruled by the elements of water and earth and hence we want to bring in the opposite qualities to create balance,' said Vara.\\nShe listed down the six principles in her post on Instagram.\\n Eliminatehttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png\\nBowels, bladder, and anywhere else toxins have accumulated overnight (ears, nose, mouth).\\nTongue scraping\\nGently scraping the tongue helps clean it.

Initial feedback from the industry has been very good and we expect a large in-water line-up of boats and an exciting collection of marine products and luxury lifestyle in the marina-side exhibition hall,' said David Hayes, CEO of organisers JAND Events.\\n\\nVisitors will be able to see the latest launches from the world's most iconic boat brands. Yachts of all sizes, both power and sail, will be on display in-the-water ranging from dinghies and day trippers up to superyachts. Onshore visitors will be able to purchase the latest boating tech, marine products, gadgets and widgets, while also enjoying luxury properties, autos and lifestyle brands on display in the 2,500sqm air-conditioned exhibition hall, the town square and other areas within Royal Phuket Marina.\\n\\nBrought into the JAND team as the Boat Show Consultant, Grenville Fordham \\u2013 co-founder of PIMEX, Thailand's first boat show, and himself a former Phuket boat show exhibitor \\u2013 said, 'After 20+ years working in different aspects of the region's yachting industry, it's an exciting time to be back in the boat show business. And working with a professional event organiser like JAND Events, I know next January's show is going to be the first of its kind \\u2013 and the best yet.'\\n\\nThailand's status as the marine leisure hub of Asia remains undiminished despite the challenges of the pandemic. Famed for its islands, stunning offshore seascape and tropical beaches, Thailand is the favoured destination for boat owners in the region and a popular choice for marine leisure tourists from all around the world. An industry valued in the billions pre pandemic, the Thailand International Boat Show will kickstart its revival and be a valuable economic driver for Phuket and Thailand going forward.\\n\\nBilled as A Luxury Lifestyle Event, the Thailand International Boat Show will be held at the SHA Plus+ certified Royal Phuket Marina. 'I believe this will be the most successful boat show yet. Not only are JAND Events professional event organisers, but they have gone to market much earlier than others have in the past,' commented Gulu Lalvani, Chairman of Royal Phuket Marina.\\n\\n'This will be the first boat show in Asia in two years and there is a lot of pent up demand for boats. Globally, boat brands are reporting record sales and as Phuket is the home of boating in Asia, I expect to see all the international boat brands and more displaying at the Thailand International Boat Show in January 2022,' Mr Lalvani said.\\n\\nA bustling Boardwalk with restaurants and bars, and an extensive social programme is also planned by organisers JAND Events.\\n\\n'To complement the in-water and onshore displays, we will be curating an exciting programme of social events for visitors to enjoy during the day and into the evening. From launches and parties to waterside entertainment, the Thailand International Boat Show will be an event not to be missed,' added Mr Hayes.\\n\\nThe Thailand International Boat Show will take place at Royal Phuket Marina on Jan 6-9, 2022.

      "      \"summary\": \"A large number of people struggle with migraines at some point in their lives. Migraines typically involve moderate or severe pain, usually on one side of the head. If you're looking for easy ways to treat migraines, specific lifestyle changes can help ease the pain or prevent headaches, even before they start. Your lifestyle has a deep connection with your health. With lifestyle changes, you can prevent or at least ease frequent headaches.\\nSleeping routine: Follow a healthy sleeping routine. About eight hours of sleep is necessary to restore the brain. Sleep helps keep your immune system strong, relieves anxiety and depression. Lack of sleep not only increases your risk of migraine, but also puts you at risk of many other health ailments.\\nRegular meals: If you are a frequent diet skipper, then you should not do this even while following a weight loss regime. Skipping meals and fasting both induce migraines. Staying hungry for a long time can cause headaches. Fasting deprives the body of essential nutrients.\\nMeditation: Stress can be a major reason behind your regular migraines. To prevent it, practice yoga, meditation and deep breathing, as it can relieve your stress and help in preventing migraines.\\nNo alcohol and no smoking: Alcohol is a migraine trigger in some people. Similarly, smoking also induces migraines in some. Excessive consumption of alcohol and smoking can affect your body from the inside, making it weak. It can also increase headaches and other symptoms.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Not too long ago, a Singapore-based company released a card game specifically centering on the food culture of Singapore called Hawker Wars. And before that, they have also produced the well-received The Singaporean Dream that focuses on the aspects that most Singaporeans face. Now, it seems like another card game is set to join the Singapore-themed shelf of tabletop games. Launching on Kickstarter on July 10, the new addition is created by The NSXperience, a group of friends who have come together to bring the experiences of Singapore's National Service Basic Military Training to the table (literally). Named Chao Recruit!, it incorporates the culture, lingo and stereotypes of the two-year service that recruits have undergone. The team's rationale behind this card game creation is to produce a bonding experience on the topic of National Service between Singaporean family and friends, regardless of whether they have served or not. In the box, players will receive 65 Action Cards, 8 Character Cards, 32 Experience (XP) Cards, 21 Kena Cards and the Rule Book itself. The objective is to complete three sets of cards that total 5XP, either by using XP cards that range from 1 to 4 XP, or Kena Cards, which brings -3 to -5 XP. As long as the combinations end up with 5XP, the collection is considered a complete set. At the start of the game, each player is given an identity card with its own talent that they can use to their advantage when it's their turn. Five cards will also be given randomly to each participant which can be used during their respective rounds. On each player's turn, they are given three actions to make: play an action card and use your ability, place an XP Card or Kena Card in your own XP zone, or move an XP or Kena Card across different sets in your own zone. Do take note that only a maximum of three different sets can be made in your XP Zone. Here is a more detailed explanation of the gameplay for Chao Recruit!: The whole game is pretty straightforward, especially for those who are already familiar with Monopoly Deal, which was the source of inspiration behind this project. Seeing that the game is catered specifically to the Singaporean audience, the team ensured that the game is entirely manufactured within the little red dot, from its design to its packaging. If you'd like to support Chao Recruit!, do check out their Kickstarter once it starts on July\\u00a010.\\u00a0Additionally, you can also check out their official website as well as Instagram for more information about the card game.

      "      \"summary\": \"\\u00a9 Provided by Lifestyle Asia \\n\\nPost-pandemic tourism will soon become a reality, thanks to the establishment of travel corridors. Also known as travel bubbles or corona corridors, these entail the opening of travel borders between neighbouring countries that allow their citizens to travel on certain routes to and from places with low COVID-19 infections and avoid mandatory isolation or quarantine period. Many countries have opened travel corridors to other countries via exclusive partnerships and seen considerable success in re-establishing connections with each other while combating COVID-19 within their borders. The travel corridors are seen as a way for economic recovery across various sectors. While many countries have released a list of destinations that are open to travel, most of them will require proof of vaccination or coronavirus test results upon entry. Here's a look at some countries that have opened travel corridors to selected nations, and their entry requirements. European Union (EU) EU has published a list of epidemiologically safe third countries that have a low rate of infection and people from these countries can enter the Schengen area from 18 June 2021. (Note that the safe list is reviewed periodically and is subject to change amidst changing infection rates and emerging variants) You can view the updated list here. The EU commission has opened travel from outside of the European Union and is easing restrictions for non-essential travel as well. Visitors will, however, require proof of vaccination. The EU is also set to launch the Digital Green Pass which to restore travel within Europe. The digital pass is free of cost and will be officially implemented from 1 July 2021. The latest list of third countries exempted from the entry ban for non-essential travel since 18 June 2021 includes Albania, Australia, Chinese regions of Hong Kong and Macao, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, New Zealand, Republic of North Macedonia, Rwanda, Serbia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States of America.

      "      \"summary\": \"If you have a baby on the way, then it's time to make sure that your home holds up against his or her growth spurts and curious mind. Expert share that you should child-proof your house a few months before your due date, since you'll likely have your hands full once you bring your baby home. Child-proofing your home is not an easy feat \\u2014 between costs and latching every cabinet with a lock, it's important not to cut corners so that you can ensure the utmost protection for your child in your home. To help you get a head start on creating a safer space for your baby, we discuss 7 easy ways you can babyproof your home. 1. Baby proof your baby bed As your baby becomes more comfortable with their legs, they'll begin to test boundaries like climbing over their crib rails. Since they can start as early as 15 to 18 months , it's important to ensure that the crib's railing is height appropriate for their age so they can't easily climb over it. When buying a crib, you can look at adjustable types which allow you to customise the railing placement. While you can expect to pay an average price of $192 for a baby crib, some of the big-brand cribs can cost as high as $1,666 . Another thing to keep an eye on as your baby gets older is your over-head baby mobile, which might actually cause more harm than good. Once your baby learns to stand, your baby mobile becomes more of a choking hazard than a sleep aid. With this in mind, make sure to remove any small toys or decorations from the nursery when you notice your baby growing into their legs. 2. Lock and secure windows and doors As a parent, it's natural to worry about your child's safety when it comes to the outside world. However, even places like your living room or bathroom could cause harm to your child if not properly secured. By child-proofing doors, cabinets, and windows, you can cross off many potential harms like drowning or poisoning from your list of worries. As your baby begins to walk, they'll become curious about more areas of the house and learn to turn knobs and open doors at will. With this in mind, you should baby-proof the door knobs of bathrooms and laundry rooms to ensure your baby doesn't get access to any tubs, detergents or buckets of water. A door knob cover can lock a door knob in place with a child safety feature, so that your baby can't open a door without your help. A pack of two to three\\u00a0covers costs approximately $9.14 from shops like Qoo10 and Baby Gates Safety. Similarly, you can use child-proof latches to secure your kitchen cabinets and other doors in your home. A two to three\\u00a0pack of cabinet locks is priced at an average cost of $11.85 . With this security, you can ensure that your baby doesn't get into areas that hold toxic cleaning supplies or other types of hazardous products. Lastly, you'll want to secure your windows with child-proof latches so that your baby can't open it, with the risk of falling out. This is especially true if you are on higher floors in your building. A pack of one to\\u00a0two\\u00a0window latches runs at about $4.64 , which will go a long way in ensuring that your baby stays safe in your home. 3. Anchor heavy items in your house Before your baby comes home, you'll want to take stock of all the heavy items in your house, like a lamp, TV, or dresser. These everyday furniture items pose a new risk, especially once your baby begins to walk and open drawers or reach for items in high places. To prevent a major accident, you can anchor heavy items in your house to the wall or the surface it's sitting on. One to two packs of furniture straps go for about\\u00a0$11.96 online from retailers. With these straps, you can secure a dresser in your baby nursery to the wall, so that it has no chance of falling onto your baby. Similarly, you can use a metal wall anchor or strap to fix your TV to the wall. If you have an item like a vase that can't be anchored, then it might be a good idea to find a new place for it while your baby is in its learning stage. ALSO READ:\\u00a04 costs to consider for a home renovation as a parent 4. Watch out for electricity Another rule of child-proofing your home is to keep electronics and electrical outlets out of reach from your baby. This means you'll need to organise your wires, keep vases with water away from electrical applications, and most importantly, cover your outlets. To avoid electrocution, you should use outlet covers to create a barrier between your curious baby and an electric socket. You can buy a two to four\\u00a0pack of socket covers for about $4.23 from e-commerce sites. 5. Gate off areas for baby safe spaces A gate can help you child-proof your home in a few ways. First, a tension-mounted gate can be propped up at the top and bottom of your staircase to prevent your baby from accidentally falling down. These gates go for an average cost of $117.53 , but you can find some simple gates as low as $17.90 from websites like Qoo10. Second, you can use adjustable gates to create a safe space for your baby where they can play, crawl, or sleep while you take some time to complete other tasks. These play yards run 83 per cent higher than your average tension or wall-mounted gate at around $215 . However, your final cost will come down to material of the gates to size of the play area that you wish to wall off for your baby.

Cover sharp corners and hard edges When it comes to baby-proofing, something as small as your table corners is important to cover. To prevent any head injuries, you should soften the sharp corner and hard edges of furniture in your home, starting with your tables. Thankfully, there is a surplus of corner guards and edge tape for purchase. With corner guards, you can blunt any hit on your baby's head when they are learning the ins and out of your home. A one to four\\u00a0\\u00a0pack of corner guards goes for about $13.46 , though it's important to ensure measurements fit your intended furniture before buying. Similarly, edge tape made of a foam material can help soften a blow if your baby were to accidentally hit their head against a side table. You can buy a roll of furniture tape for about $14.79 online. Consult with multiple baby safety guides There are many ways to baby-proof your home outside of this list and it's important to note that you should double down on your child-proofing tactics as your baby gets bigger. We recommend that you do your due diligence far in advance so that you are ready to welcome your baby into a safe environment. Here's some final tips that you can keep in mind when child-proofing your home. Switch out window looped cords with claw or wand cords to prevent accidental asphyxiation. You can also buy safety cord wraps for your window's cords, which keeps them out of harm's way of your child. Test small objects in the house with a toilet paper tube \\u2014 if the item can fit, then your baby can choke on it. If the item fails this test, make sure to keep it out of spaces that your baby will be in. Be careful with tablecloths on your table. Your baby could pull them, which would result in all the tabletop contents falling over, potentially hurting your child. Even with a baby-proof home, accidents can happen anywhere, at any time. As your baby gets older, they will test the world outside of your comfort zone, which may lead to bumps, bruises, or more. With this in mind, you could consider a personal accident insurance plan to protect your child against accidents or poisoning. With the right plan, you can rest your anxieties knowing that your baby is covered, whether they meet an accident outside or within your home.

      "      \"summary\": \"More from us: mbcn.com.ph Much like an open-air museum, Rome is a city that is teaming with history. While technology continues to reign the world today, its beautiful ruins, age-old coliseums, and awe-inspiring sculptures remind everyone of the world's ancient charm, earning it the title of the Eternal City. That is what Fendi celebrates with its latest fashion presentation. The Italian luxury house pays homage to the city by merging its old and new sensibilities in its autumn-winter 2021 couture collection. Led by English fashion designer Kim Jones, the collection showcased men's and women's pieces featuring mosaic designs, tailored suits, romantic silhouettes, and a celebration of texture and sheen thanks to delicate embroideries, recycled fur, and mother-of-pearl embellishments. \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n \\nPhoto from Fendi\\n To present Kim's sophomore couture collection, the fashion house created a runway setup that is true to Rome's majestic landscape and architecture, which makes a perfect backdrop for its fashion film. The stylish featurette is shot by Luca Guadagnino, the 'Call Me By Your Name' director, and is inspired by Pasolini's neorealism cinema, making it a true poetic visual experience. 'Rome is a fascinating city because it has so many pasts\\u2014and I was drawn to Pasolini because I have always been inspired by his vision of the world,' says Kim. 'He is something of an outsider in Roman history, but one whose voice remains constant. I have long admired Luca's work\\u2014and he is someone who, like Pasolini, touches on subjects which are relevant to now.'

      "      \"summary\": \"Baking soda has been touted by numerous guides as the number one cleaning agent to have at home. I'll admit, I've always been sceptical of its cleaning prowess \\u2014 \\u2018huh. Isn't that powdery fluff only an occasional necessity in baked goods?' But what do I know? So I've decided to put those claims to the test, cleaning everything from bathroom grout to the kitchen sink. Here are the results. Claim 1: Removes stains on bathroom taps Method : Sprinkle baking soda on tap. Use a wet sponge to scrub away stains. Results : Success! Although the really stubborn stains needed a bit more elbow grease. Claim 2: Removes coffee and tea stains in mugs Method : Make paste with equal parts of baking soda and water. Use sponge to scrub. Results : Complete success! No more having to reach out for a magic sponge the next time I want to remove these stains. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Laundry hacks you should know Claim 3: Deodorises smelly kitchen sponges Method : Soak smelly sponge in a solution of 4 tbsp baking soda + 1-litre water for two hours. Results : Didn't work. My sponge still smells like last night's pasta. BUT it did look cleaner. Claim 4: Brightens tile grout Method : Make a paste out of 1 part water and 3 parts baking soda. Apply it onto grout. Leave to rest for 10 mins. Then rinse. Results : This did brighten my grout somewhat, although I think you will need to do a little bit of scrubbing to remove the stubborn stains. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Useful hacks using salt to keep your home clean during the coronavirus outbreak Claim 5: Deodorises fridge Method : Place baking soda in a small bowl and leave it in the fridge. Results : I could definitely smell the difference. My refrigerator usually reeks of whatever raw meat I place in there, but just a couple of hours after placing the bowl of baking soda in there, there was zero smell. Incredible. Claim 6: Freshens up white towels Method : Place \\u00bc cup of baking soda in a pail of water. Soak towel in pail overnight. Then wash in normal load. Results : Stains on my white towel faded just a twinge, but it still didn't look as a good as new. ALSO READ:\\u00a046 home hacks that will make our lives easier Claim 7: Cleans kitchen sink Method : Sprinkle baking soda on a half of a lemon and use it to clean stainless steel sinks. Results : A sparkling clean sink that smells great! Although it was difficult to get to the edges of my sink with the half lemon during cleaning. Claim 8: Remove burnt marks on stainless steel pot Method : Make a baking soda paste and scrub on the burnt marks. Results : Burnt marks didn't dodge, despite extra elbow grease. ALSO READ:\\u00a010 useful household hacks for everyone Claim 9: Toilet bowl cleaner Method : Sprinkle about a cup of baking soda onto the sides of the toilet bowl and wash it off with about two cups of white vinegar. Leave it for approximately 15 mins and then scour the toilet bowl with a toilet brush. Results : My toilet bowl has never been cleaner. Bonus: The baking soda reacted with the white vinegar to produce a fun, fizzy chemical reaction (see video). Claim 10: Removes smell on silicone spatula Method : Soak spatula in equal parts baking soda and water overnight. Results : Didn't remove smell.\\u00a0 So turns out, baking soda does have a ton of cleaning abilities! While not all the purported cleaning hacks worked, most actually did. I'll definitely be keeping a box of baking soda on hand the next time I'm doing housekeeping. This article was first published in Renonation.sg.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"HONG KONG (AFP) - With their heads in the clouds and their hands in the soil, a group of office workers are busy harvesting the fruits of their labour on the roof of a Hong Kong skyscraper.\\nInvisible to those below, a sprawling garden of radishes, carrots and rhubarb is flourishing at the top of the 150m tall Bank of America tower, a stark and colourful contrast to the monotone shades of concrete, steel and glass of the city's financial district.\\nThe farm is among more than 60 that have sprouted across the space-starved city since 2015 - on decommissioned helipads, shopping mall rooftops and public terraces - thanks to initiatives such as Rooftop Republic, a local social enterprise which promotes urban farming. Cofounder Andrew Tsui sees the rooftop farms as a way for people to reconnect with how sustainable food can be produced in what he calls the current \\\"instant-noodle city lifestyle\\\" that sees so much waste.\\n\\\"What we are looking at is really how to identify underutilised spaces among the city and mobilise the citizens, the people, to learn about food,\\\" the 43-year-old told Agence France-Presse during a blustery site inspection of the skyscraper's garden.\\nMr Tsui believes that Hong Kongers need to re-establish a relationship with what they eat that has been broken \\\"since we started outsourcing our food and relying so much on industrialised production\\\". According to government statistics, Hong Kong throws out some 3,500 tonnes of food waste a day - the equivalent weight of 250 double-decker buses. Less than a quarter is recycled.\\nAnd around 90 per cent of the food eaten by the city's 7.5 million residents is imported, mostly from mainland China.\\nBut while Hong Kong is one of the most densely packed places on earth, there is still considerable space to grow food locally.\\nMr Tsui said some seven million square metres of farmable area is currently cultivated. But more than six million square metres on the city's rooftops remain unused. \\\"So we could have the potential of doubling the supply of land for growing food,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"The challenge for us is to design urban farming as a lifestyle to integrate into our daily life,\\\" he added. \\\"And the first step for that, of course, is to be accessible.\\\"\\nTo incorporate urban farms into the blueprints for office buildings, Rooftop Republic closely collaborates with architects, developers and property managers.\\nMajor companies are signing up.\\n\\nRooftop Republic urban farmers harvest vegetables grown on a farm at the top of the Bank of America tower in Hong Kong on April 9, 2021. PHOTO: AFP\\n\\nAs well as the Bank of America garden, financed by property consultancy giant JLL, Singaporean banking giant DBS has partnered with Rooftop Republic to set up an academy that runs workshops for beginners as well as professional courses.\\n\\\"In Hong Kong, most of the people focus on the commercial value of the properties. But we want to promote the concept of sustainability,\\\" said Mr Eric Lau, the group's senior director of property management.\\nUrban farmers say the projects also help build community spirit among those who cultivate the crops. After retiring from the public service, Ms Lai Yee-man said she turned to farming to connect with nature and her neighbours.\\nThe 60-year-old initially learnt techniques and tricks from professionals to develop her farming plot in the New Territories region of Hong Kong - a rural area close to the border with mainland China.\\nBut now she is passing on her knowledge to fellow residents working the Sky Garden, a 1,200 sq m facility on top of a mall.\\n\\nAt the Sky Garden, residents grow edible flowers and fruit trees and can attend lifestyle classes such as mindful gardening. PHOTO: AFP\\n\\nThere, residents grow edible flowers and fruit trees and can attend lifestyle classes such as mindful gardening.\\n\\\"People attach greater importance to their health now, they will buy organic food,\\\" said Ms Lai.\\n\\\"Here, we teach them not to waste...and to cherish their food,\\\" she explained, adding that the majority of what the mall farm grows goes to local food banks.\\nMr Tsui recognises that few young Hong Kongers currently have an interest in learning how to grow food.\\nBut younger people are often concerned about the environment and climate change, so the opportunity to generate enthusiasm is there for the taking.\\n\\\"If coding is the skill set to learn for the 21st century, growing your own food is a necessary new skill that we all need to learn to ensure a regenerative and green planet,\\\" he said.\",\n",

Sushruthi KrishnaBut, in 2016, Sushruthi entered the Femina Miss India contest where she was adjudged the first runner-up, and that win changed her trajectory in life.'This opened me up to a world of fashion and also gave me a deeper understanding of the influencer community and their strength in driving commerce. I became interested in influencer/celebrity-led brands, and I felt that there is a lot of scopes for them to be built differently in India. That's when my journey in building D2C brands started, and I have stuck to it since then,' Sushruthi tells HerStory.Her affinity for design led her to the brand-building space, where Sushruthi found a great synergy between her love for design and the ability to build a scalable business around it.\\u00a0Celebrity-led brand Samantha AkkineniSushruthi started Merch in April 2020 to build multiple direct-to-consumer brands in fashion, lifestyle, and other emerging categories.She explains, 'Ethnic wear and fusion wear is a massive market with close to 85,000-90,000 crore turnover, coming from both organised and unorganised markets. Despite that, we don't see a lot of brands operating directly to consumers online. We want to take advantage of this gap, coupled with a celebrity angle for tapping into wider regional distribution networks that aren't buying online. We believe it is a massive opportunity to unfold.'\\u00a0Merch's first brand Saaki \\u2014 launched in September 2020 \\u2014 is a celebrity-led fashion and lifestyle brand in association with actor Samantha Akkineni.\\u00a0While ideating the brand, she reached out to Samantha with a pitch via a common connection.'She really liked the idea, and we met to explore how we could build this together. We aligned on the design sensibility and brand voice; she liked the vision I had for building this as a landmark brand. We found a lot of synergies and she jumped on board,' Sushruthi says.Samantha is the Co-founder and Chief Style Editor of Saaki.From wearing Saaki outfits at home, during her travels, and even shoots, the brand has become an integral part of Samantha's lifestyle.\\u00a0'She also tries on every single sample before it goes into production. She is involved right from the ideation of designs to the shoots and to marketing the products very closely. The team works closely to incorporate her thought process into what we are building on all levels,' Sushruthi adds.Sushruthi works with a 14-member team out of Saaki's office and studio in Bengaluru.The clothes designed by the designers are produced by an exclusive manufacturer in the city. The brand has also tied up with factories across India, which develops the designs.Led by a social media community Samantha Akkineni in SaakiThe brand offers different kinds of apparel \\u2014 sarees, kurtas, sets, dresses, tops and tunics, bottom wear, and accessories, available at prices starting from less than Rs 1,000.While its customers are largely from India from across Tier I, II, and III cities, it is also seeing a lot of demand from overseas. It ships products to 15+ countries across the world, including the US, the UK, and Australia.\\u00a0Saaki has raised angel funding from prominent investors.\\u00a0'We have grown steadily and aim to turn EBITDA-positive in the next three to four months. We are looking to grow 2-3X in revenue in FY22 and are well on track to achieve the same. We intend to grow into a Rs 200 crore brand in a four-year window,' she says.Sushruthi believes the key to Saaki's success has been a strong digital community of women on social media who play a pivotal role in making brand decisions.\\u00a0'Everything \\u2014 from picking brand colours to finalising our logo to what kind of styles we make \\u2014 is strongly led by our social media community, who constantly help us in ensuring we bring out the right products for them,' she adds.At present, the brand is focused on offering only apparel wear. However, Saaki intends to expand and move into offering a complete wardrobe solution \\u2014 accessories, skincare products, and a few other emerging categories.Having come from a family of independent women, Sushruthi says she didn't have to face many challenges in her entrepreneurship journey.\\u00a0'Even though we have come a long way, we still have miles to go before we have an equal representation of women entrepreneurs in the business world. Don't let anyone tell you what you are capable of. You are your own master, and as long as you have an unwavering belief in your ability and calibre, nothing should stop you,' concludes Sushruthi.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"MEADVILLE, Pa. (PRWEB) July 09, 2021 'A Philadelphia Christian in Beelzebub's Court': a faith-based call to worship. 'A Philadelphia Christian in Beelzebub's Court' is the creation of published author S. C. Cundiff, a loving husband and father who founded LivingStones Fellowship in Lewiston, Idaho. He is currently the Senior Pastor of Bethel Community Church in Bethel, Oregon. Cundiff shares, 'This book is a treatise for God, who is deserving of a family of holy people. It is for God, who commands a holy lifestyle from those for whom His Son died and rose again. This book clearly explains how most Christians have been taught erroneous things regarding a holy lifestyle over a period of the last seventy-five to one hundred years. By comparing the charges Christ gave to the seven churches or church ages, in the book of Revelation, we see positive and negative blueprints for the types of Christians living today. Christ gave this direct revelation to the apostle John with the intention that the comparison should strike the hearts of believers and allow them to see that there are positive church types living then and today (Smyrna and Philadelphia) and negative church types living then and today (Ephesus and Laodicea). If any of today's believers in the latter group are sadly justifying their lives, they need to know that there is still time to change.' Published by Christian Faith Publishing, S. C. Cundiff's new book is an engaging discussion of modern Christianity. The author presents a powerful argument for considerations in church reform with respect to biblical teachings.

But how did she do it? Well, Sheila\\u00a0shared her secret with her followers and it is a practical tip that will come in handy for parents who often struggle to convert their picky eaters into healthy chompers.\\u00a0 Sheila Sim's nine-month-old now loves broccoli! The actress shared the cute video on Instagram where her daughter is seen holding on to a broccoli and then chomping on it like a champ. She clearly needs no help and the little one knows what she's doing and loving it too! But this wasn't always the case with Layla. In another video a few months ago, she couldn't even stand the smell of the vegetable. Her head could\\u00a0be seen wobbling as she attempted\\u00a0to bring the broccoli close to her mouth, but she immediately recoiled because of its smell.\\u00a0 [[nid:533573]] So how did Sheila\\u00a0successfully convert Layla into a broccoli lover? Well, the answer is simple: patience and persistence.\\u00a0 Sim continued to feed Layla the greens, even though she rejected it initially. This led the little one to give it a few more shots before she developed a liking for it. Well done, mama! This time tested technique truly is the backbone of getting children to become healthy eaters. But broccoli in particular can be a tricky one to get used to. Which is why you must explain its many benefits to your little one and also try the other techniques we list below.\\u00a0 6 broccoli benefits for baby You can introduce broccoli as soon as your baby is ready to start solids. This is generally around six months of age. Broccoli, as you may know, is a nutritional powerhouse and a one-stop shop for vitamins and minerals that your baby needs. It is rich in vitamins A, C, K, B6 and folate and comes loaded with iron and zinc, as well.\\u00a0 Here's why your baby needs broccoli It is rich in calcium and aids in the growth and development of your baby's bones and teeth. It has vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant and helps to boost your developing your child's immune system. They are high in Omega 3. They help babies with inflammation and allergic reactions. Broccolis are rich in protein and iron that aid in the treatment of anaemia in infants. The vitamin K in broccoli will help in developing the child's memory. The fibre present in broccoli will help avoid constipation and will facilitate good bowel movement.\\u00a0 ALSO READ:\\u00a0Woman shares a clever viral hack that stops her kids from eating junk How to make your kids love new food If you're finding it hard to get your children to eat not only broccoli but other vegetables, a new scientific study may have the answer. As part of the study,\\u00a0researchers\\u00a0doubled the amount of corn and broccoli on children's plates served at a meal,\\u00a0from 60 to 120 grams. The results were astonishing. Experts found that kids ate 68 per cent more vegetables on their plate, which is around 21 grams extra. But, they have also highlighted one potential problem with doubling the vegetable portions, which is it may increase wastage if they don't eat it.\\u00a0 Sometimes we try to season the vegetables thinking that it may appease our kid's taste buds. But, the study highlighted that seasoning the veggies with butter and salt does not affect the children's consumption rates. \\u00a0 So try the following tricks to feed your babies greens, specifically broccoli. Keep serving a new food multiple times It is important for your kids to understand the taste of the food. So you may need to serve a new food multiple times before they learn to accept it. It is okay if they reject them. But be persistent till they actually dig into it. If your child rejects the taste of a new food like broccoli for the first time, you shouldn't stop serving the food to them. Sociologist Dina Rose says that kids need to taste a new food somewhere between 10 and 15 times before they'll finally accept it. ALSO READ:\\u00a0Nutrition for kids: Which vitamins are essential for children? Invite them to taste the food Dr Rose recommends that instead of asking your kids \\\"Did you like the food that you tasted?\\\" invite them to taste the food and share their views. You can ask questions like, \\\"How is the texture of the food?\\\" \\\"Is it crunchy or smooth?\\\" \\\"How does the food look?\\\" You will find that the more your kids get accustomed to tasting different foods, they less fear they'll have in their minds. Only when kids manage to eliminate this fear, will they let go of their inhibition of trying out new foods.\\u00a0 3 delicious broccoli recipes you\\u00a0can prepare for your baby Lemony Broccoli Ingredients Broccoli (1 head) Lemon Olive oil Butter Steps Cut florets away from the stalk.

You can add some salt to the boiling water so that it gets into the pasta. Cool it until the pasta is soft Then steam the broccoli and finely chop them Drain the pasta and then add it to the broccoli. Mix the egg yolk and the butter as well at this stage.\\u00a0 You can add milk, cheese and mustard. Keep stirring until the cream melts. Add the broccoli, salt and pepper and mix the pasta well. Note: In order to minimise the risk of choking, chop the broccoli into small pieces. Steam the florets until they are soft and then slice each floret in half lengthwise along the stalk. Remember that steaming helps to retain the nutrients of the broccoli as compared to boiling. You can also roast the broccoli, but for younger babies, steaming is usually the safest option. When your baby becomes an advanced eater (12 - 24 months), you can decrease the amount of time you are steaming.\\u00a0 So try these recipes and follow Sheila's\\u00a0secret: persistence and patience to convert your picky eater into a healthy one.\\u00a0 This article was first published in theAsianparent.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"The stakeholders could do more to secure the future of our children\\nThe concerns expressed by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) over growing attacks on schoolchildren, as well as child abductions in Nigeria, should be taken seriously by the authorities. No fewer than 950 students have been abducted in the country since last December, according to a statement by UNICEF Executive Director, Ms. Henrietta Fore. About 500 of these children were abducted within the past six weeks. 'It is not enough to condemn these crimes, not when millions of children face a worsening protection crisis,' said Fore. 'Children living in these areas need concerted action to ensure that they can safely live and go to school or fetch water without fear of being attacked or taken from their families.'\\nWe agree with UNICEF on the urgent need to tackle this growing pattern of roving genocidal gangs who target schools and homes to abduct innocent children. We challenge the federal government and the authorities in many of the states concerned to do a little more than the usual display of incompetence and blame game that have deepened our insecurity. Indeed, repeated attacks on schools in recent years have created fear in many vulnerable students and their parents, especially in some sections of the country and is affecting the attitude to education. The implication of this unfortunate state of affair is damaging and enduring. Dozens of students and five teachers were recently abducted from Federal Government College, Yauri, Kebbi State in a third of such mass kidnappings within a month. They reportedly killed one of the police officers on duty, broke through the gate and went straight to the students' classes. Meanwhile, the number of students abducted from Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna State in the early hours of Monday have been put at 121 with their captors threatening that the students would starve to death if their parents do not supply foodstuff before negotiations could begin on payment of ransom.\\nHowever, while we urge the authorities to move quickly to ensure the safe return of all our children that are in captivity, including in Niger State, payment of ransom and doing deals with criminals cannot be a sustainable approach to handling a challenge that borders on law and order. When a school is under attack and students become targets, according to Manuel Fotaine, West Africa Regional Director of UNICEF, 'not only are their lives shattered, the future of the nation is stolen.'\\nWhen gunmen enter school premises almost at will to cart away children, government must understand that it is dealing with a serious problem. From Federal Government College, Buni Yadi where no fewer than 58 male students were brutally assassinated to Government Secondary School, Chibok where more than 100 girls are yet to be accounted for seven years after to Government Girls' Science and Technical College (GGSTC), Dapchi where Lear Sharibu remains in captivity on account of her faith three years after her colleagues were released, these criminals not only target the most vulnerable of our citizens, there is also a calculated attempt to further polarise the country.\\nSince we cannot afford to leave our children at the mercy of criminal gangs who are bent on truncating their future, there is an urgent need to go back to the drawing board on how to keep the schools safe. As Fore argued, 'every effort must be made to reverse the spiralling protection crisis for children' who have now become sitting targets for criminal cartels. When parents can no longer send their children or wards to school without the fear that they could be abducted, the future of our country is in jeopardy.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"In her new column for The Drum, Ally Owen catches up with individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to understand how she can become a better ally. Emmanuella Owusu-Ansah is her latest guest.In this series, you'll get to meet a talent who will share their individual story so we can gain a deeper understanding of their experience and the interventions that will make us a better ally to them.Today, my latest guest is Emmanuella Owusu-Ansah, currently a programmatic activation executive at Manning Gottlieb OMD.Emmanuella shares her challenging journey into the industry and mixed experiences, from turning her Zoom camera off due to the discomfort of being the only Black face in a sea of white to feeling valued and respected.It's key that we remember it's a privilege to be able to educate yourself around racism and learn from another's experience, rather than experiencing it yourself.Ally: So Emmanuella, thank you for taking the time to speak to me about your experiences. Can you tell us a little bit about your journey into the industry?Emmanuella: My journey into the advertising industry brought a lot of frustration, to be honest. I felt like no matter how hard I tried, doors were always being closed. I invested my time and energy going to interviews, and was promised feedback that I never got.It often felt like employees were lacking in the decency to tell me what I could do better, and it meant I couldn't learn from the mistakes I was making \\u2013 and that everyone makes when they're starting out. Everyone's hiring system is different so it's hard, and each person hiring has their own perception of what they want, regardless of what is written in the job description.You did have some older friends in the industry already, which is a rare bonus \\u2013 what did they do?One was a creative, and another worked in CRM. They would both help coach me so I'd get interviews. And I did get interviews but I didn't get the roles. And as the time passed, I needed money \\u2013 I live in London!Also, while I was a front desk receptionist, I met an executive creator director and we still talk today. He gave me loads of encouragement and tips. He allowed me to sit in meetings and give ideas on briefs. It was so refreshing! He believed in me and saw potential in me. It helped me believe in myself a bit more, after all the rejections. I'm interested to know if you have ever had an occasion where you were taken advantage of, despite having a sense of the industry already through these relationships?Yes! I once worked for an entertainment company and got to know the marketing manager there. A small festival couldn't afford their services so she suggested they speak to me at reception. I jumped at the chance.I was told I would be paid to work on their social media in my spare time. I naively thought I would get paid, and didn't understand I should have had a contract. However, after discussing my ideas with them and starting to create posts for them I found out they already had a social media agency on retainer. After the festival, I asked for payment continuously but I was ignored. I wasn't paid a penny.It's so important that the industry does more to protect those seeking experience and internships from financial abuse. I really admire how you took control of a terrible situation. So how did you come to finally enter the industry?I knew I wanted to get into advertising, but I didn't know how. I did the 2020 Change \\u2018I AM CHANGE' program. And there was an induction for BFS and there I realized, the \\u2018how' turned out to be BFS. I knew I loved advertising and how stories can relate to different types of people and there wasn't enough representation. I wanted to be part of the change, whether that was on screen or in the industry behind the images we see. When you see someone like you on screen it's so important. You see someone like yourself and don't feel invisible. It made a difference for me and I wanted to help others see themselves too.Then Covid-19 hit and being put on furlough allowed me to do BFS. I then did an internship and started working at Manning Gottlieb OMD, and I am now in the position where I am able to recommend talent to them. This has resulted in two other Black girls who were my contacts getting into programmatic!When you entered the world of programmatic, did you see an immediate need to improve diversity at all and are you a part of that change?I could see MGOMD is diverse as a company, but in what I do specifically, in programmatic, there weren't many Black or Asian people from what I could see. I knew I was in, so I could get girls who look like me in as well. It's the little things I can help do when it comes to diversity.I always thought I would have to be chief executive or director before I could enact change. But the director asked me, and as I set a good example, they trusted me to refer. I gave them seven people all together \\u2013 they asked me about the process and who I thought was best, and they interviewed everyone and picked two. Talking about it now I realise I've minimized it in my mind.You've completely minimized it! Did MG quickly understand your value?Yes they have! And I feel valued and part of them rather than being the \\u2018other'. Hearing friends' experiences, they will say: \\u2018Because I am the only one everyone thinks I speak for all Black people.' But every Black person's personal experience is very different, so no one Black person speaks for all.Do you feel you have to ask for respect that others are automatically given?Yes. When I've been in a senior position, others from a different ethnicity have ignored me unless I've brought someone else in. I often found myself becoming rude or standoffish as I was being demeaned and that was the only tone they would respect.Now I stay calm and don't play into it. Also, I have in the back of my mind that if I don't do well in what I am doing the next Black person might not be given a fair chance because of me. I don't want that. So I'm my sister's/brother's keeper.What a burden and a lot of pressure. Did you ever have an ally in these moments?In the past I had a manager who was Black, and he would do what he could, but he was experiencing the same. He would ignore those that disrespected him if they asked him for something in the office. He had got to the point of \\u2018you have no respect for me ever, so I do not need to speak to you'.From my knowledge, many people feel like if they report something to HR that has to do with race, not much will be done. Especially if the disrespectful person was senior. You learn to navigate around these people. Our manager did his best to protect us, he spoke up for us.How has this injustice affected you?It led me, in past internships, to deciding not to turn my camera on so colleagues wouldn't see I was Black on Zoom meetings. Especially when I was in spaces where I was the only Black face. You see your face standing out against a sea of white. You stand out. Post-BLM, it's a sensitive time \\u2013 it's not helpful to be the only one. That's definitely not the case now. I do feel confident in showing who I am, even if I am the only Black person on the call.It must be very painful to be in that situation. What does the industry need to be doing to improve?Ultimately it's about hiring more Black people and other ethnicities, recognizing that there is a problem and checking in to see if people are OK.A colleague once said to me: \\u2018Seeing you has made me think I should employ more Black people into the company.' It shouldn't have taken seeing me in a sea of white to realize what a problem they had. But then I realized that a lot of people don't put energy into things that don't affect them. If it was the other way round...It's also about having a proper plan in place and not running with the excuse that the company is busy. But it's about the people at the top. If they aren't fixated on change then it won't happen. Companies are there to make money, but you need to make sure the people who make you that money are OK. As well as it being right to treat all employees with equal respect, a contented workforce is much more productive than a distressed one. It's good business. If I want to get the best out of you at work, I need to make you happier.What has your experience been like at MG?It's been great so far! I'm happy there. The thing that gave me so much reassurance was that when I put on my LinkedIn that I got a job there, a number of Black people from other companies reached out to me and said it was a good place. That made me feel much more confident.I think it's important for the industry to realize our networks do talk about companies and we don't signpost talent to places where we know they won't thrive. Do they not realize we can choose too? It would be stupid to think we don't talk. I've been told to avoid places and have a list of places where I know there aren't safe spaces at this point in time. People seem comfortable with being part of the majority and I have to deal with being part of the minority.Have you seen a slowdown of changemaking post George Floyd?Yes, definitely \\u2013 a huge slowdown. Though there are still companies and programs like BFS and 2020 Change that are actively making a choice to try.Those in power should reach out/respond to those who are reaching out without power. Lean into one Linkedin message request, and leverage that power to help someone else who doesn't have the same start as you.Finally, do you have any resource recommendations for people to explore to help them be a better ally?The Trusted Black Girl: Challenging Perceptions and Maximizing the Potential of Black Women in the UK Workplace is a book I recommend you read to understand the experience of Black women in the UK workplace. There are also a number of really great podcasts as well, such as Black Women Working, Adulting 101 and To My Sisters \\u2013 give them a listen!Ally Owen is an industry changemaker and founder of Brixton Finishing School.If you would like to share your entry-level experiences with Ally and provide further insight into the industry's practices, please fill out this confidential questionnaire.\",\n",

With schools and colleges being shut, its publishing business went down to zilch. But Navneet expanded into digital learning models. And now, it will be a play on the reopening theme too. Naneet's key markets are Maharashtra and Gujarat. Maharashtra has said that schools can open from mid-July. But Sunil Gala, MD & CEO, Navneet Education says that the reopening of schools will be gradual and erratic. The impact of the lockdown was large. Navneet's most profitable\\u00a0segment, publishing, saw FY21 sales at only 40% of sales of FY20, a pre-COVID year. If schools reopen this year, Gala says they will reach 70-80% of pre-COVID sales. \\\"It will take a while for schools to decide on education material so it may be a little delayed but we should see much higher sales than last year. Navneet Education does have a big contribution from Stationary sales in the US as well which has opened up and resumed activities to a large extent. But Gala says that their US customers have already stocked up on stationary prior to the lockdown so they don't see many new orders. However, he does bet on the office segment\\u00a0revival which will help them grow substantially. Exports business was down 20% but Gala is confident that export sales will be back to 100% if pre-COVID levels. \\\"Once schools restart students will need materials beyond textbooks which will boost demand across all verticals\\\", says Gala. Their facilities are more than ready to handle the gush of demand that will come through once educational institutions reopen.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Friday, 9 July 2021 00:04 - \\u00a0 \\u00a0 - {{hitsCtrl.values.hits}} The pandemic may have brought about many negatives for the Government, whether it be managing the economy or the countries creaking healthcare system, but one \\u2018positive' has been the cover it has seemingly provided for them to pass legislation away from the public gaze.\\nEarlier this year, it was the Port City Commission Bill which scarcely provided room for debate, and the latest is the Kotelawala University Bill, which has many stakeholders up in arms.\\nThe Bill proposes to allow the existing General Sir John Kotelawala National Defence University (KNDU), which at present trains primarily defence personnel, to award degrees, charge fees and invest the profits in any business considered suitable by the university's administration, as well as being able to admit students and partner with other private and foreign institutions.\\nControversially, the Bill also places the management of the university under the Defence Ministry, with a senior officer of the armed forces as the university's head or vice-chancellor, not under the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, as is the norm.\\u00a0\\nThis is the point which many have taken umbrage to, with the latest protest this week resulting in several arrests, including that of Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) student protestors and Ceylon Teachers Union Secretary Joseph Stalin. That the arrests have been conducted under the pretext of the protesters violating pandemic-related guidelines on large gatherings, is problematic in and of itself, but is discussion for another day.\\nRather, it is important that we take a closer look at the grievances these protesters have against the KNDU Bill, namely, that it could lead to militarisation of higher education in Sri Lanka. This is indeed something even the JVP has brought up in the past, stating that 'the proposed management and regulatory structure for the KNDU proposed in this Bill relies primarily on military personnel and offers minimum space for external accountability and overview'.\\nThat said, the fact remains that changes are undoubtedly required in Sri Lanka's higher education system \\u2013 especially when it comes to Universities.\\nOnly about 17% of students who qualify for university entrance actually gain admission to a State university in Sri Lanka, leaving hundreds of thousands of promising youths behind. State universities' inability to absorb all deserving students has resulted in an inequitable situation where students are forced to either resit the Advanced Level examination or seek alternate means of tertiary education or find employment via some form of vocational training.\\u00a0 Successive governments have attempted to find a balance between public and private universities but have found little success.\\nSri Lanka should seriously consider following a system such as that found in Australia where universities are graded for transparency and local students are given prominence, but the system is so effective and efficient there are plenty of foreign applicants as well and the universities attract highly qualified teachers and administrators.\\u00a0\\nWithout such a transparent and independent regulatory system and investment mechanism, higher education in Sri Lanka is at risk of being sold to the highest bidder \\u2013 or in the case of the KNDU Bill, the potential militarisation could pave the way for rapid militarisation, commercialisation and a decline of quality, standards and fundamental goals and objectives of university education in the country.\\nThis is especially problematic as education will be a key decider of the living standards of future generations and the growth trajectory of the entire country. Saddled with an aging population, Sri Lanka needs to make the most of its human resources.\\u00a0\\nHopefully the Government can find a way to negotiate a better return for everyone keeping in focus the capacity to achieve universal social mobility as the ultimate indicator of the success of a university education.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"I am puzzled by the controversy about The 1619 Project and Critical Race Theory. As a former educator I find it appalling we would not want our students to be exposed to a more balanced set of facts. Not opinions, facts. In his June 8 article, Bryan Anderson of the Associated Press described CRT as an examination of systemic racism in American institutions.The 1619 Project was initiated by the New York Times and tells a broader story of our country's history. The author of the introduction, Nikole Hannah-Jones, won a Pulitzer. I haven't heard anyone ask to replace current history curricula with these programs, but to use them as supplements.I went to college in the 1970s never hearing about the Tuskegee syphilis experiments in the 1930s, or about redlining in federal housing policy, or the fact that Black World War II veterans were unable to obtain equal access to the GI bill or VA loans, or about the Tulsa Race Massacre, or how nearly all the toxic industries in our country are located in the parts of cities occupied by mostly black and brown people, or about the thousands of lynchings that occurred between 1880 and 1950, some of which happened in Iowa and Illinois.In the 1990s I was required to take a multicultural course and found it challenged some inaccuracies in my training and made me rethink some assumptions.Don't we want our students to be critical thinkers? Isn't that what education is really all about?\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"There is an educational divide by race in Chicago, as federal data shows wide gaps in advanced placement courses, segregation and discipline between African-American, Latinx and White students. Even in the face of that data, Chicago Public Schools officials say Black and Latinx students have made tremendous academic strides, which has led to educational experts noting CPS as 'one of the fastest-improving districts in the country.' Still, the district said there is much work to be done to address the impacts of centuries of disinvestment in all facets of life that students still feel the impact to this day. Just ask college student Styles Avant-Pinkston. The University of Illinois-Chicago junior said when he was growing up in West Austin, some families made the decision to send their children out of the neighborhood to get a good education. 'If you're not in a good elementary school, you're gonna most likely go to a middle school that's not good and then when it's time to take a test to get into these good schools in Chicago, you haven't been trained for this,' said Avant-Pinkston. Avant-Pinkston is now is studying history and secondary education and said he wants to teach in his childhood neighborhood. 'We need to make sure that these neighborhood schools are being the best, they are the best of the best,' Avant-Pinkston said.\\u00a0'I shouldn't have to take a fifty minute bus ride to go to a good school.\\u00a0 I should be able to just walk to a good school.' Black and Brown students make up the large majority of CPS students, and yet a ProPublica analysis of 2015 federal data shows white students are 2.3 times more likely to be enrolled in at least one advanced course as Black students. 'We're dealing with a hundred years of really intentionally exploitative economic policies towards Black communities and policies that explicitly created a segregated school system,' said Alexios Rosario-Moore, Ph. D of the UIC Department of Education Policy Studies. According to numbers released by the US Department of Education, in 2017, Black students made up just over a third of CPS's student population, but more than three quarters of CPS students who were expelled were black. Chicago Public Schools opened its Office of Equity in 2018 to address educational equality. 'Chicago Public Schools is deeply committed to improving outcomes for all students and closing the opportunity gap between white and students and Black and Latinx students is among our highest priorities,' said CPS spokesperson James Gherardi.\\u00a0 'While the root causes are systemic and it will take time to fully address, the district remains committed to continue doing everything in our power to ensure students in every community have equitable resources and educational opportunities.' CPS said in 2020, students achieved a record-high five-year graduation rate of 82.5%, an accomplishment spearheaded by strong gains from Latinx and African-American students. Additionally, CPS said it has restructured admissions to selective enrollment high schools to ensure access from high performing students in every corner of the city.\\u00a0 The district added disciplinary action continues to improve for the district, including a reduction of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, police notifications and student arrests taking place on school grounds. Still, Rosario-Moore said it is important to examine school policies to make sure disparities can be mitigated. \\\"We're in the single digits for graduating young black men from four year colleges and we know that there's a strong association between four year degree completion and wealth,\\\" said Rosario-Moore. UIC said it's Call Me MISTER (Mentors Instructing Students Toward Effective Role Models) initiative is to increase the pool of available licensed teachers from a broader, more diverse background.\\u00a0UIC said the initiative supports undergraduate students who want to teach and serve as role models in urban elementary schools to positively impact the lives of children.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"By Tanushree SenThe Cooke Town community donated towards the education of three little girls, an initiative spearheaded by two Good Samaritans of the neighbourhood It all began when Deepti Nair moved to Cooke Town in April this year. She would go for walks and was often accompanied by three little Nepali-origin girls, and she befriended them and started talking to them. That's when she understood that the girls were missing out on their education due to financial constraints, and so, with the help of her neighbour, Pamela Parashar, an animal activist, they decided to pitch in and do something for them.\\n 'I had just moved in here in April and Geeta Didi (their mother) used to work at my home. The three little girls would often accompany me for walks when I would go out with my pet. After talking to them, I realised that they were not going to school because of financial constraints,' says Nair. According to Nair and Parashar, their father -- who also works as a security guard in the nearby buildings \\u2013 had been unable to provide the school fees for more than a year, and so, the kids could not attend their sessions. The fees had a backlog of a year. 'It didn't help that the father had a mentality where he thought that the girls did not need an education,' adds Nair. 'The Marie Niketan School principal told us that they had called the parents several times to come to the school, but there was not much of an effort.'\\n And so, the two women decided to do something. Nair posted on social media last week, asking for donations to fulfill the pending fees of Rs 1 lakh. And the response was overwhelming, she says.\\nDeepti Nair Within one day, donations had come in \\u2013 some from the Cooke Town community and some from the nearby neighbours and some from Nair's and they got more than what they wanted. One lakh, 10 thousand was the collected amount and after paying the fees, the women bought books and items for the little girls, studying in the fifth, third, and first grade respectively.\\n 'The girls are super smart and disciplined, and if you meet them and speak to them, you will know what I mean. They are very enthusiastic and already have their goals set in mind,' adds Parashar. 'I'm really glad that we did this and the community also did their best.'\\nPamela\\nHowever, while the girls' fees have been paid for now, they will again have to pay the fees the net year. The women hope that some initiative is started which will take care of their education in the long run. \\nIf you wish to donate or help these three little girls, you can write to nair.deepti15@gmail.com.Are you an East Bengaluru resident?

They just want the resources to do a good job, to deliver high quality education.So they say to deputies \\u2013 don't pick your model and try to make it work.

      "      \"summary\": \"Source: Background vector created by Starline | www.freepik.com.This post is the first of a two-part series on 5G systems.\\u00a0 Imagine a world with no wires or cables, where virtual reality is always present and accessible. In the post-COVID-19 era, the educational landscape has sped into digitalization. Most classrooms have adopted some form of virtual learning, requiring video conferencing and other devices, but that has not come without technical difficulties. The lack of access has amplified the technological gap in parts of the world.\\u00a0 However, the integration of 5G networks into education delivery has the potential to revolutionize connectivity issues and streamline classroom logistics while improving the quality of the entire learning experience. 5G will help teachers across all educational levels facilitate an enhanced experience for learners. So, what is 5G, and how can the global education community use its capabilities to transform teaching and learning now and into the future?\\u00a0 What is 5G?\\u00a0 5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology, is the fifth iteration of cellular network operations. It differs from 4G, the most prevalent wireless technology, due to latency \\u2014 the delay between sending and receiving information. With its extremely low latency rate, 5G allows educational delivery to be faster, more reliable, and smoother\\u00a0. For example, when compared to a 4G cell tower, a 5G cell tower can hold and support about 10 times as many devices. This is highly relevant in an educational scenario since lower latency and greater available bandwidth will support superior levels of communication over larger distances.\\u00a0 Take the university campus, for instance. An expanded campus reach can improve accessibility to wireless networks, and some universities have already begun the integration. The University of Miami first brought this technology to its campus, making it easier for students to access classes and engage in academic pursuits. 5G can also improve the quality of video conferencing, add haptic response capabilities, strengthen immersive learning experiences using virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), and allow for the personalization of education. For example, the AR app Froggipedia allows students to study a frog's internal organs without harming any real frogs. It also enables students to visualize the transformation of frogs from tadpoles into their adult form. Another example, in continuing education, is VirtualSpeech, a VR tool that helps individuals work on their public speaking skills in a more effective and realistic manner.\\u00a0 How can 5G transform the global classroom? Let us now look at the five main benefits of 5G for learning: 1.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Improved interaction between teachers and learners and collaboration among peers\\u00a0\\nWhen you log into Zoom, there is a high propensity toward lagging and breaks in connectivity, which negatively impacts educational delivery. With 5G, video conferencing platforms will improve in quality and reliability around the globe. Therefore, instead of waiting for programs to load, time will be better spent connecting teachers with learners, even in remote settings. Teachers will save time by not having to work around delays in connectivity or breaks in audio and video connections and instead focus on the learner. Students will be able to download videos and learning materials faster and even have holograms of guest speakers in their classroom without dips or delays. Also, since 5G allows more data to be transferred, communication among peers for group projects will happen faster and with less lag \\u2014 almost as if people across geographies are sitting in the same room. 2.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Accelerated quality and adoption of immersive learning\\u00a0\\nSome skills, such as lab work and hands-on experiences, require extra tactile stimulation to engender the same level of learning online as in real life and real-time. Those interested in learning new skills and visualizing abstract concepts in an interactive way can benefit from the integration of AR and VR into immersive classrooms. 5G will provide a greater network capacity and seamless experience that allows learners to explore complex concepts through zooming, pinching, and even touching. Further, haptic responses (that reproduce the feeling, touch, or motion of interacting directly with a physical object) could introduce tactile forms of learning to a classroom through traditional video conferencing platforms, making interactions richer.\\u00a0 3.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Personalized learning experiences\\nEducation generally follows a one-size-fits-all approach that many say could hinder growth. 5G has the capability to change that! It will improve personalization by creating intelligent systems to understand the unique needs of each student and create targeted learning journeys. For example, virtual teaching assistants could allow cohorts to access different sets of lessons and assessments depending upon the profile and preferences of learners. This has implications for skilling and upskilling as well as technical and vocational education and training (TVET). 4.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Boosted on-the-go learning\\u00a0\\nAs 5G expands to reach more aspects of daily life, it will make learning on-the-go easier, providing greater responsiveness and speed across all devices, especially mobile. Imagine the increased flexibility given to busy students and professionals who want to (and need to) learn outside the classroom. 5.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Leveled playing field5G will accelerate the promise of democratizing access to quality education in inclusive and affordable ways, thus leveling the playing field, especially for under-resourced communities.\\u00a0 For example, the 5G-enabled Verizon Innovative Learning classroom brings learning to life through immersive worlds. It has the power to change the way all of us learn.\\u00a0 5G clearly has a lot to offer in education. In the next installment of this series, we will examine some of the challenges facing the rollout of the technology for learning and how it might contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 4\\u2014Quality Education.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"By Mukhtar Garba Kobi On Jul 9, 2021Education, as we generally know, is the best legacy one can give to the children. Education guides attitudes, leads to positive activities and help the entire society live cordially with one another. The education sector has been the engine room of all other sectors but of recent, it is suffering setbacks caused by incessant kidnappings carried out by bandits. The first incident of students' mass abduction occurred in 2014 when over 200 students of Government Girls' Secondary School, Chibok were kidnapped by insurgents.From that time, academic activities, especially in secondary schools, are carried out in phobia and uncertainties of where is the next target. Parents in rural areas that were forced to enroll children in schools are using students' abduction as excuse for preventing the kids from going. Increase in students' kidnappings has become a big threat to the future of students.To end kidnappings in its entirety, governments should employ or enroll repentant kidnappers. Discriminating against repentant kidnappers does nothing but pull them back to their ignoble activities. It is necessary for everyone to treat them with love, care and concern. People should live within their means. Excessive lust for money and luxuries often times leads to regrets and it is pertinent to live a contented life. If arrested kidnappers are found guilty, they should be punished according to the provisions of the law irrespective of who they are or who they know.Mukhtar Garba Kobi, 08100358411.YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNEWe Have Not Had Water Supply In Months \\u2015 Abeokuta ResidentsIn spite of the huge investment in the water sector by the government and international organisations, water scarcity has grown to become a perennial nightmare for residents of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.

      "      \"summary\": \"Under a budget proposal currently sitting in the California Legislature, UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego would cap out-of-state or international admissions to no more than 18% in the next three years. The rationale behind this nonresident cap is that seats at UC campuses should be saved for California taxpayers. But a troubling paradox emerges: While capping the number of nonresidents would create 4,500 additional seats for California students, it also would likely decrease the quality of education and opportunity for all UC students, Californians included.\\nA quick fix to inequity in education access is enticing but not realistic. We oppose the nonresident cap.\\nFirst and foremost, the UC system might not be able to afford it. According to Chancellor Carol Christ, the current state allocation for each California student fails to meet the actual cost of instruction, so the UC system relies on the inflated tuition paid by nonresident students. While the budget proposal offers to cover that shortfall, it creates vulnerability to recessions or future budget cuts.\\nIt's also worth noting that nonresident students are not eligible for California or UC financial aid. A decrease in nonresidents might prompt an increase in everyone's tuition, pushing a UC degree further out of reach for lower-income admits. The gap filled by nonresidents benefits all students on campus, whether they grew up in the East Bay or were raised an ocean away.\\nStudent culture benefits from a diverse student body composed of people from all backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses and geographic origins. Instead of feeling pitted against one another based on where they are from, students should be able to celebrate the opportunity to learn with peers from all over the planet.\\nFinally, UC Berkeley is not turning down in-state students at a higher rate than other American public universities. While UC Berkeley historically has accepted more nonresident students than any other UC campus, the most recent available data shows that it still has a nonresident student population that is considerably smaller than the average at other U.S. public schools.\\nThose who support the nonresident cap might correctly recognize the inherent class stratification bred on most college campuses. Admitting more nonresidents inherently favors those who can afford out-of-state or international tuition. Non-Californians who leave their home state to pursue a UC degree often gain access to more opportunities and a higher quality of education than others back home, exacerbating inequality through generational wealth and privilege. But this is the product of a larger, all-encompassing issue of unequal distributions of opportunity and education \\u2014 one that a nonresident cap is unlikely to fix.\\nUltimately, everyone should have the ability to receive a quality education, regardless of geographic origin or socioeconomic status. Creating additional barriers to entry for non-Californians works against that ideal.\\nEditorials represent the majority opinion of the editorial board as written by the summer 2021 opinion editor, Sarah Siegel.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"by Karen Schoen\\nA fact is a piece of information that can be proved with concrete evidence. An opinion is a view or judgment about something and can change often. Education is supposed to immerse the individual in facts so that whenever a decision is needed, the individual can make the most logical, common-sense decision.\\nHistorical Facts: Thousands of white people died in the Civil War trying to end slavery. The voting rights act was passed in 1965. The Great Society Legislation passed in 1964-65, spending millions on urban renewal, medical care, housing, and transportation for rural and inner-city blacks.\\nSensible conclusion: Discrimination/oppression of black people ended a long time ago.\\nWhile a fact refers to something true or real, which is backed by evidence, documentation, etc. Example: the moon's temperature ranges from -298F at night to 224F during the day, which has been determined and confirmed by astronomers, scientists, and lunar landings.\\nOn the other hand, opinion is what a person believes or thinks about something. Example: I think the moon is made of green cheese; it sure looks like it on a cloudy night, don't you agree?\\nFacts make use of the left brain, and by using proper skills, the individual can reason, prioritize, and come to a logical conclusion. Once these skills are realized, the individual can make quick, common-sense decisions. Example: If in multiplication 5 x 3=15, then in division 15 divided by 3=5. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacts are universal and only change when solid, verifiable evidence is found that refutes the fact. Example: For centuries, wise men believed the earth was flat. When explorers returned with evidence there is no end-point, the earth is round, and you can circumnavigate it, the fact was changed.\\nOpinions use the right brain where emotion will guide the decision, often making judgments without basis. Emotion is a learned response to a particular situation. Emotions are abstract and often personal, so they are easily changed.\\nA person can only think of one thought at a time. If only the left brain is developed, then the individual has little time for issues that involve emotional responses, i.e., art, movies. If only the right brain is developed, the individual can not reason, lacks common sense, and will often make decisions based on how things look rather than how they operate.\\nIt's very difficult to understand the relationship between SEL, CRT, and CRT because they are three different approaches to the same thing, Emotionally controlling the people. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCritical Race Theory: CRT is a Theory, a system of rules, procedures, and assumptions used to produce a result. Who's opinion, who's assumption, what if I disagree? Many common tactics in CRT training, including segregating people by race, race-shaming, ascribing certain attributes to people based on race, and ' claims that by virtue of race, a person is inherently racist or inclined to oppress others.' You must assume things to be true.\\nSocial-Emotional Learning: SEL forces the child to see all issues under an emotional lens, often shutting down the right brain to logic and reason. Too often, the child gets so emotionally charged that they become unruly (so involved in their emotion) and no longer have the ability to express themselves. They no longer have the ability to listen to an opposing viewpoint because it doesn't make them 'feel better.' So Johnny, who had a bad feeling from reading about the boy who lost his life getting hit by a train, gets mad at the engineer instead of asking why the boy was on the track to begin with. Emotion overplays logic. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe purpose of school is to disseminate factual information for a person to store in their brain and use at a later time when needed to make informed decisions, i.e., common sense. However, a person thinking through emotion will never have a firm footing. They will constantly be thinking, how do I feel about that? How am I making others feel? Decision-making becomes a horror. Emotion changes constantly. Because Facts rarely change once the individual knows facts, they become more secure in their decisions.\\nA student taught to think of everything in terms of SEL will become an emotional person incapable of having a conversation with an opposing perspective. They lack common sense and don't have the ability to draw conclusions logically. They allow others to make decisions for them rather than risk hurting someone else.\\nJohnny White, Suzie Black, Jose Brown were in class. The teacher asked what 2 plus 2 is. Johnny knows the answer but is afraid to raise his hand because the rest of the students will think he has white privilege. Suzie thinks she knows the answer but won't say anything because what if she is wrong and the others laugh at her and hurt her feelings\\u23e4she will just want to die. Jose knows the answer but won't talk because he will get a passing grade for coming to school. How does this create excellence?\\nAnd the answer is\\u2026IT DOESN'T. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the goal is not excellence, the goal is division. The ruling class of Globalists doesn't want people to come together as Americans. They don't want the populace to think logically or to think factually. They don't want people to communicate because they might have an opposing view. They don't care about the truth because the ends justify the means. They want the populace to be trained to think about how they have designed the world to think emotionally. Emotional people are easier to control \\u2013 no opposition. They want the people to 'stay in their lane.'\\nCulturally\\u00a0Responsive\\u00a0Teaching is a pedagogy that recognizes the importance of including students' cultural references in all aspects of learning. CRT is a fancy term for multiculturalism (dividing people by ethnicity) which means stay in your tribe. No exploring America or American values of being the best you can be, you must be the same as everyone else in your tribe. Instead of students learning the 'new ' ways of American exceptionalism where they can make their own choices, they must choose from what the rulers have offered. Instead of people coming together as Americans, they stay apart based on ethnicity. CRT will constantly divide the population. Culturally Responsive Teaching | Teaching Diverse Learners \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inability to make clear decisions based on facts too often pushes the person into an emotional dilemma. I am stuck, they think. I can't make a decision. I am an emotional mess. Where are my pills? If I give the right answer, will my compatriots think I am a racist? I'll kill myself rather than be called a racist. There is a reason why the suicide rate is climbing.\\nBy eliminating facts, skills, and morality, the person never has a firm footing. Things change all the time. Not being on a secure footing destroys confidence and self-esteem.\\u00a0 This type of training is now filtered throughout all disciplines. ELA, MATH, SS, Science are all seen through an emotional racial lens called diversity, inclusion, reparations, equity, social justice and etc.\\nThey can't eat, sleep. Can't cope? Not to worry, there is a syndrome, psychiatrist, and drug for that. Must be something wrong with you\\u23e4need a sex change?\\nSocial-Emotional Learning (SEL) is the vehicle used to guide CRT into the conversation. By claiming everything in life is dictated by racism CRT, students are inhibited from speaking, expressing their true feelings. Maybe Suzie Black gets the answer wrong because she didn't do her homework, which is nothing to do with race. Johnny White is stuck because he will be called a racist exercising his white privilege if he gives the right answer. Everyone will think I am a racist. So rather than giving the right answer, the student is prompted to think\\u23e4is this answer going to offend someone else? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(OR) The teacher asks the question, who knows what two and two are? Johnny thinks, why bother answering\\u23e4they will just call me a racist. I'll just play with my blocks; besides, if I don't answer anything, I'll pass anyway, and that is safer.\\nRather than answer #4, learning the fact and moving to the next fact, children are now fearful of giving the wrong socially acceptable emotional response that someone they don't know decided they should have. They are inhibited and are learning to keep quiet even when they are right. So if they can't be right when they know they are, they will do something else to get attention \\u2013 drugs, sex, pink hair, body piercing, drinking, etc. Children will do anything to get the attention they lack from being right in school in front of their peers.\\nSEL and CRT are just fancy names for behavior modification. A psychological trick used to elicit the appropriate required response for an action. All the child does is learn the responses approved by the textbook company. If you follow procedure, you will get the correct OUTCOME.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0No innovation, no creation, no competition, no thinking outside the box. Now every child must think inside the box. There is no room for individuality which is its purpose. No wonder why the STEM attendance is so poor. No thought, just stimulus, response, stimulus, response, training for Pavlov's dogs, not people.\\nWe are not graduating individuals. We are graduating clones who, given the right stimulus, will give the right response. No reading, writing, or math is needed. Just respond the way you were taught. White people are bad and the cause of your problems. If you are a minority, you are the victim and can blame someone else for your problems.\\u00a0You can riot without consequences.\\nThere is a reason why Collier Co. Schools are failing and graduating students who are only 34% college-ready. Focusing on emotion, not facts, does not prepare an individual for worldwide competition. Focusing on emotion does not enable a child to learn to read, write and do math which is the purpose of education. Every text regardless of subject contains CRT. Please do not adopt these texts.\\u00a0 We need a real pause to find great texts and curricula for Florida's students.\\nBased on the four domains of the Social Justice Standards (Identity, Diversity, Justice and Action) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9 2021 Karen Schoen \\u2013 All Rights Reserved\\nE-Mail Karen Schoen: [email\\u00a0protected]\\nWebsite: http://www.karenschoen.com\\nThis content is courtesy of, and owned and copyrighted by, https://newswithviews.com and its author.

      "      \"summary\": \"The University of Otago has once again topped the key Government indicators that measure the educational performance of students at New Zealand's universities.Released today by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), the annual Educational Performance Indicators (EPIs) examine course and qualification completion rates, retention rates and progression to higher levels of study.Qualification completion measures the percentage of students who have gone on to complete a full qualification (e.g. a degree) within a specified number of years of commencing their study. Course completion is the pass rate for the component courses/papers that make up a qualification.According to these measures, Otago ranked a clear first for overall student qualification completion, first year retention, and progression. In the other measure, course completion, the university ranked third.Assessing performance over 2020, this being the most recent complete academic year, this excellent result follows Otago topping all four measures in 2019, topping three out of four measures in 2017 and 2018, and earning a clean sweep of all the key indicators in 2016.Otago also ranked first in this latest round for M\\u0101ori in three of the four measures and second in the other. It ranked first for Pacific students in one of four, second in two and third in one.Otago's acting Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic), Professor Pat Cragg, welcomed the strong showing of Otago in the latest indicators.'Supporting our students to achieve to their potential is an enduring point of focus here at Otago, as our ongoing EPI performance aptly demonstrates.'It has been most pleasing to achieve such a strong result for 2020, a year so obviously disrupted by the COVID\\u201119 pandemic. Our latest result is testament to the huge amount of effort and dedication both staff and students put in during a year that was exceptionally challenging.'Otago's showing in the latest TEC performance measures:Course completion rate (91.2 per cent)First-year retention rate (84.3 per cent)Qualification completion rate (73.3 per cent)Student progression rate to higher level study (95.2 per cent)Educational performance indicator reports (TEC website)\",\n",

On Legal Education as Training for Justice and the Rule of Law (Against the \\u2018Dark Sides of Legality') (Netherlands Journal of Legal Philosophy, Volume (50), Issue 1, 2021, pp. 3-12) on SSRN.\\u00a0 Here is the abstract: To quit or stay? To co-operate or to push back? Indeed, lawyers are sometimes faced with these thorny dilemmas. In this editorial essay the author draws on David Luban's recently published 'Complicity or Lesser Evils: A Tale of Two Lawyers' and the comments provided by Leora Bilsky and Natalie Davidson arguing that these difficult dilemmas not only occur in \\u2018illiberal regimes', but they also regularly occur in liberal legal orders. This claim is illustrated by a discussion of the Dutch Childcare Benefit Affair and the troublesome role of lawyers therein. What role do law schools have in developing a professional ethical compass on the part of future lawyers that allows them to deal responsibly with such dilemmas? Shouldn't we in response to large-scale injustice and in addition to the question 'where were the lawyers? not also seriously address the question: \\u2018where were the law schools'? In line with Bilsky and Davidson, the author argues that as part of a realistic legal education more attention should be paid to the \\u2018dark sides of legality'. Recommended!\",\n",

      "      \"excerpt\": \"I can't tell if the year was a triumph or a total flop. In some ways, we are completely burned out; in others, it's still Spring Break 2020.\",\n",
      "      \"summary\": \"As I sat down to write my annual self-evaluation for the past academic year, it dawned on me that my experience was a shared one: From kindergarten to graduate school, students and teachers all endured the same tragedy and triumph. Here's my take as I wish all of us a safe and successful start to the upcoming school year as we reboot education for 2021-22. Academic year '20-'21 will most likely be recorded as 'The Lost Year.' The COVID-19 pandemic effectively shut down traditional education for an entire academic cycle, an absolutely unprecedented event with consequences that will reverberate for years, possibly decades, across all levels. With in-person instruction impossible, nearly every educator was required to rapidly pivot to online instruction, deploying a dizzying combination of self-authored materials, pre-packaged lessons and the instantly\\u2013ubiquitous Zoom conferences. It was a difficult, heartbreaking and frustrating year for students and teachers. However, despite the tragedy, most of us still gained tremendous experience in teaching online and, perhaps most importantly, in compassionately guiding students who were enduring the same tragedy we were. My opinion remains hopelessly mixed. There were victories: I came to trust Zoom as a communication platform after a very rocky start. I wrote the equivalent of three textbooks worth of curriculum. Students praised the well-organized Blackboard lessons and lauded the fact that all late penalties were waived. I'm not alone in these accomplishments. Most educators work hard to help students succeed. But failures abounded as well. Working from home often proved nearly impossible. I don't have a home office space, so sitting for hours in a living room chair was harmful to me physically. I lost energy, gained weight, and gradually developed repetitive-motion injuries in both elbows. I struggled to put in anything like a full-time schedule. Real-world distractions constantly pulled me away from the less solid reality of online teaching. The 'virtual' versions of meetings and professional seminars that usually provided networking opportunities were tedious at best, unbearable at worst, and I began skipping them altogether. This created ongoing professional isolation. I haven't seen most of my colleagues in 18 months. Students were equally mixed in their successes and failures. Their adaptability amazed me. These kids had to rapidly learn new software and new communication modes while simultaneously coping with a nearly apocalyptic social catastrophe. Yet last year students produced some of the best work I've ever seen. Two of them actually got professionally published. These folks discovered and embraced the benefits of online education, enabling them to balance their busy, stressful lives and still achieve their education goals. For many, attending school online was wildly successful. Yet at the same time, deep sadness and anxiety pervaded. I saw front-line health care workers Zooming during their lunch breaks, masks on, eyes wide in exhaustion as they tried to discuss their writing topics while sick patients waited just outside the break room. Single mothers tried to homeschool while taking class, apologizing constantly for falling behind, incessantly thanking me for not punishing them for being overwhelmed. And I had first-timers, equally terrified of both the virtual world and the real one. Many of these just disappeared. They logged in once or twice, got swamped and sank. So I can't tell if the year was a triumph or a total flop. In some ways, we are completely burned out; in others, it's still Spring Break 2020. We have pressing questions to answer. What did this last year do to us all? Which changes should stay? The goal remains as clear as ever: serve students as well as we can. But how do we make education more compassionate, adaptable, and accessible without letting distractions, trauma, and inexperience wreak havoc? I'd like to think that all will be well as long as we stay focused on that goal. And yet, as August draws near, I sense a growing anxiety: Maybe the system is broken for good. Maybe I've forgotten how to do my job. Most likely, I'll have nightmares in late August. Most likely, I'll be fine by September. Here's hoping that you find your way as well.

      "      \"summary\": \"Islamabad : Islamabad police has signed an agreement with a renowned educational institution for quality education to the children of the employees on affordable fees.\\n\\nA ceremony to this effect was held at the Police Lines Headquarters here on Thursday in which AIG (General) Khalid Rasheed signed the agreement with the KIPS College. College principal Khawar Mahmood Khokhar represented the educational institutions' chain in the agreement. The police took the initiative on the directions of IGP Islamabad Qazi Jamil ur Rehman so as to ensure quality education to the children of policemen. Under the agreement, children of in-service, retired, and martyrs would be able to avail the offer.\\n\\nAs per the agreement, children of martyrs will be able to get an education without any fee while a total of Rs25,000 concession would be given to the children of serving and retired policemen on annual tuition fee. The principal of KIPS College Khawar Mehmood Khokhar while addressing the participants said that sacrifices of Islamabad police martyrs would be remembered forever and termed the incentive a humble gesture to support their families. Chief Guest Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG Headquarters) Islamabad Kamran Adil thanked the management of KIPS College for this agreement who, he said, was contributing a lot to quality education. He said that the welfare of Islamabad police is their top priority while equal education and health facilities would be provided to each policeman whether from officer or lower cadre. 'It is our responsibility to ensure the welfare of families of those policemen who sacrificed their lives for our better future,' the DIG remarked. He said the police was busy providing relief to its employees in whatever possible way which he believed will boost the morale of the force.\\n\\nThe department had earlier taken several initiatives for the welfare of the employees including signing agreements with educational institutions as Islamabad Science School and College, Nicon Group, Air Foundation School System, and The Smart School.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"By Yasmine Regester, Peacemaker Staff Writer / July 8, 2021 Share this article: The Guilford County Board of Education has received threatening emails over the last two weeks, filled with racial slurs and derogatory language.\\nThe messages were sent through the school district's 'Let's Talk' messaging program, which allows the public to send comments directly to district leadership. Some of the emails, which are now public, called the board members, 'single-cat ladies' and called for Guilford County Schools (GCS) Superintendent Dr. Sharon Contreras' termination.\\nOne of the messages was attributed to an email address that included a reference to the Proud Boys, the far-right group whose members have been associated with both the 2017 White supremacist torch-bearing rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack.\\nDr. Sharon ContrerasIt was followed by another email that suggested that Guilford County Schools create a \\u2018Thank You White People Day,' in order to 'celebrate their enormous generosity,' because, 'They allowed millions of poor non-White immigrants (expensive) from all over the world to immigrate to their country and enjoy a high standard of living even though they're going to become a minority in the United States.'\\nOn June 10, during a regular school board meeting, members of Take Back Our Schools-GCS staged a protest outside of the school district offices. Take Back Our Schools-GCS (TB) is a local conservative coalition of parents and community members who have advocated for an increase in school resource officers, protested an appeals process for suspensions and now oppose critical race theory.\\nThe group returned to the board's June 17 meeting where there were reports of yelling through a megaphone during the meeting that took place, as well as banging on the windows. School board members and school staff have expressed that they feel their safety is at risk with the amount of vitriol that has been aimed towards them recently.\\nIn person meetings have been closed to the public for more than a year now due to the pandemic, with all meetings being held virtually. The public is allowed to submit comments online. The meetings are scheduled to reopen to a limited number of the public at its next meeting on July 13, while still following state social distancing guidelines.\\nIn the emails, people also argue against Critical Race Theory (CRT) being taught in schools. However, GCS leadership maintains that CRT is not part of the approved curriculum and is not taught in schools. Guilford County Schools Board of Education chair, Deena Hayes-Greene noted that 'dog-whistle words' are being linked to CRT, such as 'race' or 'white.'\\n'It's unfortunate and troubling that we have local people here under the guise of caring about all children. The agenda around all of it has all been in opposition to everything the superintendent has done, all the way to calling for her termination. The group has engaged school board members to get her fired. It's elicited some very dangerous characters. I don't minimize what this could lead to,' she said adding, 'Our ultimate goal is safety.'\\nDeena Hayes-GreeneDistrict leadership has commented that the emails have been handed over to local law enforcement and the situation is now under investigation.\\nIn response to the emails and recent events, Take Back Our Schools-GCS said they are not behind the emails.\\n'There is a great divide in our country about CRT. The perspectives and definitions of CRT can be seen with two vastly different lenses. TB holds that endorsing or perpetuating racism of any kind is unacceptable. TB has never threatened anyone, ever. Whatever alleged threats that were made to anyone at GCS were not by anyone in this group to our knowledge. If anyone was a part of any kind of threatening, we would remove them from the group immediately as well as report them to authorities. There have been publications that have twisted and manufactured incorrect information about TB to form a narrative. TB is a platform for parents and community supporting strong learning environments and safe schools for all,' the group said in a statement to the Carolina Peacemaker.\\nCritical Race Theory or CRT is an academic concept developed in the 1970s by a group of legal scholars, intended to study how racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice, but also something embedded in legal systems and policies.\\nAcademic experts, such as Dorinda Carter Andrews, professor and chairperson, Department of Teacher Education at Michigan State University's College of Education, assert that critical race theory is not an ideology or a political orientation that assumes White people are bad; it assumes White supremacy is bad in all of its forms. It's a practice or approach that provides language and a lens for examining racism at institutional and structural levels. Underlying this is the premise that racism is endemic to American society and those White supremacist ideals and practices should be dismantled.\\nCritics of CRT assert that the theory leads to negative dynamics, such as a focus on group identity over universal, shared traits; divides people into 'oppressed' and 'oppressor' groups; and urges intolerance.\\nOutside of CRT, Hayes-Greene who is also cofounder and managing director of the Racial Equity Institute LLC, an organization that specializes in racial equity training, says she does not feel that students are learning enough about race in schools.\\n'Brown vs. Board of Education was not about reviewing and transforming our education system to reflect what we say our American values are: equal opportunity, life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. We have never been accurately historical about our history. We have not done a review of our curriculum or education standards so they (students) have never received an accurate history of the United States.'\\nShe also said that over the years, the school board has discussed enhancing the curriculum, but that it is a complex structural issue.\\n'We have tried to integrate reading material and information that is reflective of the diversity of our district and nation and that's been challenging,' said Hayes-Greene. 'And we can't ask teachers, on top of what they are already asked to do and teach in the classroom, to then take a crash course on facts and information that they haven't been exposed to. There needs to be a cross-systems effort that looks at the college level, educational testing services, textbook publishers, schools of education\\u2014so it's just not that simple. But it is long overdue to have that conversation,' said Hayes-Greene.\\nAlthough the emails have been worrisome, Hayes noted that the school board has also received support from the community that spans across racial and socioeconomic lines.\\nAccording to the N.C. Public Instruction, CRT is not taught in any North Carolina schools. But the discussion of CRT being taught in elementary schools has now become a national discussion.\\nOn Tuesday, July 6, Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the second largest teachers' union in the U.S., put her support behind teachers being able to teach 'accurate history' during opening remarks at the union's biennial TEACH professional development conference. She noted that CRT is not taught in public schools and the union has a legal defense fund ready to defend any teachers who are accused of teaching it.\\n'Let's be clear: critical race theory is not taught in elementary schools or high schools. It's a method of examination taught in law school and college that helps analyze whether systemic racism exists,' said Weingarten.\\nShe went on to add, 'Culture warriors are labeling any discussion of race, racism or discrimination as critical race theory, to try to make it toxic. They are bullying teachers and trying to stop us from teaching students accurate history. This harms students. These culture warriors want to deprive students of a robust understanding of our common history. This will put students at a disadvantage in life by knocking a big hole in their understanding of this country and the world.'\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday stressed on adapting higher and technical education to the changing environment and emerging challenges and asked centrally funded technical institutions to reinvent themselves and develop innovative models to meet future needs.Interacting with over 100 heads of institutions via video-conferencing, the PM called for building an ecosystem of technological education in Indian languages and translate global journals into regional languages. Modi described the education sector as a social investment, and asserted that 'access, affordability, equity and quality' should be driving higher education, with focus on the youth, women and those from deprived background.Union minister for education and skill development Dharmendra Pradhan, ministers of state Annpurna Devi, Rajkumar Ranjan Singh and Subhas Sarkar were also present during the interaction.Modi noted that \\u2018Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' will form the basis of dreams and aspirations of India in the coming 25 years when the country celebrates 100 years of Independence and technological and R&D institutions will play a major role in the upcoming decade which, he added, is also being called as 'India's Techade'.He lauded the research and development work done by these institutions towards meeting the challenges posed by Covid-19 and appreciated the efforts of young innovators towards providing quick technological solutions.In a post-interaction tweet, Modi said: 'Had an enriching interaction with directors of leading IITs and @iiscbangalore during which we exchanged thoughts on a wide range of subjects including making India a hub for R&D, innovation and popularising science among the youth.' Modi said the country's higher educational and technical institutions need to prepare the youth for continuous disruptions and changes, keeping in mind the fourth industrial revolution.He underlined the need to progress towards education models that are flexible, seamless, and are able to provide learning opportunities according to the requirements of the learners and appreciated the improvement in the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education in the past few years. Pradhan said India has got a New Education Policy after a period of 34 years and the Indian education system has taken a giant leap in fostering an environment for a futureready 21st century India. During the interaction, Professor Govindan Rangarajan of IISc Bangalore, professor Subhasis Chaudhuri of IIT Bombay , Professor Bhaskar Ramamurthi of IIT Madras and professor Abhay Karandikar of IIT Kanpur gave presentations to the PM and highlighted various ongoing projects, academic work, and new research being done in the country.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"In the fall of 1939, Perry Christianson became a faculty member at Coeur d'Alene Junior College, which was located on the third floor of the city hall. He taught math and chemistry, plus coached the basketball team. With the formation of North Idaho Junior College and a new campus, he continued to teach for the next 23 years. He also served as Dean of Men and Dean of the Faculty. After the death of President Kildow in 1962, Christianson became the fourth president of the college. During his administration, dormitory housing was offered for the first time, enrollment reached a record high of 892, the faculty nearly doubled, and a new library/classroom wing was constructed. Christianson was also very active in community affairs. He was president of the Junior-Senior P.T.A., the Coeur d'Alene Campfire Council, the Coeur d'Alene Wildfire Confederation, and the Coeur d'Alene Kiwanis Club. He also served two years on the Coeur d'Alene City Council followed by three terms as the mayor of Coeur d'Alene. In addition to his community activities, he served on the Higher Education Commission of the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools. The North Idaho College gymnasium complex was named in his honor.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Chandigarh: Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday said a plan should be made to reopen the educational institutions subject to the strict adherence of the COVID-19 protocols. \\\"Given the decline in the number of COVID-19 cases, a plan should be made to reopen the schools at the earliest,\\\" Mr Khattar said. At present, schools, colleges and universities in Haryana are closed due to the second wave of COVID-19. \\\"As of now, the COVID-19 curve is flattened. Therefore, while ensuring strict adherence of COVID-19, the educational institutions should be reopened at the earliest,\\\" said the chief minister in an official release here. The chief minister presided over a review meeting regarding the implementation of the National Education Policy(NEP) in Haryana here. Khattar said the state is already leading the way to ensure successful implementation of the NEP by 2025. \\\"Since the announcement of NEP, dedicated efforts have already been made by both the state and Central governments for spreading extensive awareness among the teachers, stakeholders, but making each child who is the real beneficiary of this policy aware is the need of the hour,\\\" Mr Khattar said. During the meeting, top officials of four departments -- Women and Child Development, School Education, Higher Education and Technical Education -- apprised the chief minister about the blueprint of the successful implementation of NEP by 2025 as announced by him during the Budget session 2021. The chief minister was apprised that the recommendations of NEP have already been placed in practice in Haryana and even the recommendations made by Haryana have also been included in NEP. He said possibilities of opening one school in each district offering foreign languages should be explored and the number of these schools should be increased according to the demand. He said these schools should be opened with residential facilities. A cluster plan should be made for these schools, the chief minister said. Khattar was apprised that out of the 4,000 play way smart schools, as announced by him, 1,000 are ready to start the admission process as soon as the educational institutions are reopened.

Photograph: ANI Photo. Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi's expansion of the Union council of ministers on Wednesday, July 7, was unlike other ministerial reshuffles he has undertaken since he came into office in May 2014.\\nIn inducting 43 new ministers in his government, Modi has empowered OBCs and SC/STs. 27 of the new ministers come from Other Backward Classes, 12 from the Scheduled Castes and eight are from the Scheduled Tribes.\\nTo find out the impact of Modi's ministerial caste churning, Syed Firdaus Ashraf/Rediff.com spoke to social scientist Badri Narayan whose books Republic of Hindutva -- How Sangh is reshaping Indian Democracy and Fascination Hindutva: Saffron Politics and Dalit Mobilisation are a must read to understand how the Sangh Parivar is reshaping India's caste super-structure.\\nAs a political scientist how do you see this jumbo expansion of the Modi ministry?\\nIf you read my book Republic of Hindutva you will understand exactly what happened in this expansion. This expansion will help the Bharatiya Janata Party expand its social roots. Now they are inclusive in their governance.\\nYou are talking of inclusion, but where are the stalwarts like Arun Jaitley or Sushma Swaraj in the Modi government?\\nWhat is democracy? Democracy is the politics of aspiration. And whichever government rules in a democracy is itself a reflection of democracy.\\nGovernments and ministries will have to reflect that. Till now it was not done because democracy did not progress that way in our country.\\nWe will have leaders from the lower strata in the future and you might not get a leader like Arun Jaitley in our Parliament.\\nWhat you are saying is that the English-speaking elite has made way to others?\\nIndia is a country of such people and only they must get representation. We have illiterate people in our masses and they will have to get representation.\\nBut then there are professors and learned people too in this Cabinet. I am only saying that in the 1960s there were many Congress leaders and ministers who could not even sign their name and they used to be in power.\\nIs this the first time that such a large caste base has been included in the Union council?\\nYes, I think so. This is the first time that such a huge community alliance has been formed and provided space in governance.\\nWhich is a good thing so long as government efficiency is not sacrificed at the altar of social re-engineering.\\nYes, it will be efficient because many times a simple village man is more efficient than people like us.\\nWhy do the English-speaking class feel they are the only ones who are efficient in work?\\nMy own mother was from a village and she was more efficient than me. She used to handle crises better than me.\\nWe will have to come out of our elite perception of governance.\\nDon't you feel Modi has expanded his government keeping only elections in mind and not governance?\\nWhat is democracy? Democracy is only elections and governance. They will run the government in a good way and also benefit in elections due to this Cabinet expansion. What is wrong in it?\\nThe exit of Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar was shocking, they were the face of the government.\\nIn inclusion of social communities or marginal communities, it does not matter who is in and who is out.\\nYou don't need good-looking ministers on television.\\nYou also don't need ministers who speak well on TV. You need ministers who can deliver on governance.\\nLet us wait and see how these newly appointed ministers perform.\\nAs far as Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar are concerned, the BJP must be having some plan for them. They do not do anything just for the sake of doing. The put a lot of thought behind every political move they put in. The BJP is a very well-planned party.\\nIs this exercise akin to Rabri Devi's induction as Bihar chief minister in the mid 1990s?\\nNo minister of the Modi government is like Rabri Devi and secondly, Rabri Devi was not a bad chief minister in terms of governance.\\nThere was lawlessness for sure, but it was more during Laloo Yadav's time vis-a-vis Rabri Devi's rule. Laloo was an BA and MA. In her (Rabri Devi's) time, crime didn't grow in Bihar.\\nHow do you take India to the future when we still go by religion and caste in matters of governance?\\nDid you see any religious person among these ministers? Every minister was looking modern in their outfits, and like family men or women. I didn't see anyone wearing a tilak, except maybe a Telangana minister.\\nThe BJP is like us. They are just like you and me. They wear and eat the same things as we do.\\nMoreover, it is not a guarantee that only educated people can run the government well.\\nGovernance needs a different kind of wisdom. In many democratic countries it was found that not so educated people have ruled very well.\\nAny example you can think of in India?\\nKarpoori Thakur (chief minister of Bihar in 1970-1971 and 1977-1979) was not very well read, but he did well. He was not someone like (Madhavrao) Scindia who studied abroad and came to India. He was a decently educated and ran the state very well, and so did Mulayam Singh Yadav who ran Uttar Pradesh well. He was hardly a BA, I think. He did well in governance.\\n\\nKarpoori Thakur and the power of street politics\\n\\nMulayam Singh did carry out the Yadavisation of UP politics.\\nI know where you are coming from because caste is different and governance is different.\\nIs it true that the Modi government, while not sharing the data on OBC population with their opponents, is using it to their advantage in politics to win elections?\\nIndian society is like that and politics will be played on those terms. We can talk hi-fi things, but on the ground level these things (make you win elections).\\nLike in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been seeking statistics on the OBC population from the Centre which the Modi government is not willing to share.\\nAgreed, this statistics everyone needs.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Tribune News Service New Delhi, July 8 Prime Minister Narendra Modi today interacted with directors of centrally funded technical institutions and stressed on the need to adapt higher and technical education to the changing environment and emerging challenges. Interacting with over 100 heads of institutions via video-conferencing, he advocated a robust and upgraded research and development culture, which will boost the country's campaign for self-reliance. 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan will form the basis of dreams and aspirations of India in the coming 25 years when it celebrates 100 years of Independence,' he said. 'Our technological and R&D institutions will play a major role in the upcoming decade \\u2014 \\u2018India's Techade'', the PM said. He said the desired paradigm change in the country's education matrix would need institutions to reinvent and reevaluate themselves and develop alternative and innovative models. The PM lauded the R&D work done by these institutions towards meeting the challenges posed by Covid. He appreciated the efforts of young innovators towards providing quick technological solutions. 'Our higher educational and technical institutions need to prepare our youth for continuous disruptions and changes, keeping in mind the fourth industrial revolution,' he said. He underlined the need to develop an ecosystem of technological education in Indian languages and translate global journals into regional languages. The Prime Minister noted the improvement in the gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education in the past few years and observed that digitisation of higher education could play a big role in increasing GER. Modi batted for focus on developing futuristic solutions in fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, defence and cyber technologies. He stressed on the imperative of good quality infrastructure in higher educational institutions to ensure that products associated with artificial intelligence, smart wearables, augmented reality systems and digital assistants reach the common man.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Wednesday said inclusion of UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 in Pakistan's national development agenda was reflective of its political commitment to ensure an across-the-board uplift of its people.Addressing the launch of 4G broadband services in Multan and Khanewal districts, the foreign minister said Pakistan in pursuance of SDGs had adopted certain areas on priority basis including hunger eradication, health and fitness, quality education and economic growth. The Universal Service Fund (USF) under the Ministry of Information Technology awarded a contract Rs154 million to Jazz for providing high-speed mobile broadband services in Multan and Khanewal districts of Southern Punjab. The minister said information communication technologies (ICT) and global connectivity were important to enhance human development, eliminate digital divide and build knowledge societies. Qureshi said promotion of ICT could prove helpful in poverty alleviation by making markets digitally accessible for farmers and improve food security. He said the efficient use of information communication technology was an effective measure to combat the COVID-19 situation by raising awareness campaigns through mobile networks, data collection and analysis, epidemic geo-fencing, and vaccination records. He recalled that during the coronavirus pandemic, the government gave away Rs203 billion to 15 million poor families through digital cash system under the Ehsaas Emergency Programme.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"Image: Marvel's Spider-Man (Insomniac)\\n\\n\\nLike many others have, I spent some time \\u2014 maybe too much \\u2014 playing Spider-Man.\\nWhile I thought I'd be taking a break from chemistry research, I found myself web-swinging through virtual research missions all over New York City. I collected samples of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Hell's Kitchen, studied vehicle emissions in Chinatown and determined the chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter in Midtown.\\nSpider-Man has many of these eco-friendly research missions. But what I found most encouraging is that the game also includes tools that can potentially teach advanced concepts in chemistry and physics. These tools include adjusting the wavelength and amplitude of radio waves, rewiring circuits to meet target voltages, and what will be examined here, using absorption spectroscopy to identify unknown chemicals.\\nBeleive it or not, the millions of people playing Spider-Man have been unwittingly introduced to principles of quantum mechanics. There is a lot of veiled science to this aspect of the video game. Perhaps more importantly \\u2013 as a chemistry researcher and university lecturer \\u2013 I believe the game represents an interesting opportunity to teach science in a fun and engaging way in higher education.\\nSpectroscopy and \\u2018Spider-Man'\\nTo better understand the scientific technique that players simulate in 'Spider-Man,' it helps to have a short primer on what absorption spectroscopy is. The interaction of light with matter is the most powerful means scientists have to understand what matter is made of. When matter does not interact with light, we are quite literally left in the dark. This problem is made obvious in the still unknown composition of dark matter that constitutes the vast majority of matter in the universe.\\nUsing light to study ordinary matter like atoms and molecules is a broad field of science known as spectroscopy. It is an important part of university courses in chemistry and physics. There are currently many different types of spectroscopy. However, the underlying concepts are almost entirely the same as the original version that began in the 17th century when Isaac Newton first dispersed sunlight with a prism.\\nAs famously illustrated on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon\\u00a0album cover, dispersing the white light of the sun with a prism reveals its continuous colour spectrum extending from violet (higher energy, shorter wavelength) to red (lower energy, longer wavelength). However, if this is done carefully, you would find that this continuous spectrum is patterned with intermittent dark bands.\\nWhile the origin of these dark bands was not fully understood until the 20th century, scientists now know that they are due to absorption of specific wavelengths of light by atoms and molecules present in the sun. In fact, this kind of spectroscopy led to the discovery of helium in the solar spectrum before it was identified on Earth. This is why it derives its name from the Greek 'helios' meaning sun. So what causes this phenomenon? Atoms and molecules have a set of energy levels that depend on how their electrons are arranged. The absorption of light \\u2013 which remember is energy \\u2013 can cause the electrons to rearrange into these different levels. The catch is that the energy \\u2013 or wavelength \\u2013 of light must exactly match the energy difference between two electron arrangements in an atom or molecule for absorption to occur. This set of energies is unique for each chemical and leads to a distinct absorption spectrum much like a fingerprint from which it can be identified.\\nIn Spider-Man, the player identifies unknown substances using simplified versions of these spectra.\\nThe goal is to match the pattern in the spectrum using the fragment inventory provided to give the absorption spectrum of the unknown substance. Unfortunately for chemists everywhere, determining the chemical structure of an unknown molecule is much more complicated.\\nStill, there is a significant amount of science conveyed in the video game version of what a spectroscopist would call assigning this spectrum. Only slight modifications and additional explanation could make these parts of the game an excellent way to teach these concepts to undergraduate science students. But are video games ever used in higher education?\\nVideo games in higher education Video games for teaching more elementary skills like arithmetic or spelling are common. Similarly, universities are increasingly infusing video games into their coursework.\\nIn a recent publication in the journal Nature Chemistry, researchers presented a modified version of Minecraft\\u00a0called 'PolyCraft World.' In this game, the player learns polymer chemistry by crafting materials in the game. Preliminary results showed that students learned real chemistry through the game even though they weren't doing it for grades or getting regular classroom instruction.\\nIn the popular game Kerbal Space Program, the player builds their own space program by successfully launching rockets into orbit. The game was not originally intended for educational purposes but implements rigorous orbital mechanics in its physics calculations. It is so accurate that NASA joined the game's developers to create new missions, and it now has a teaching-ready standalone game that could be used directly in university physics courses.\\nA unique approach has been taken with the biochemistry-based game FoldIt. This game serves as both an educational as well as a citizen science platform. In the game, players manipulate the structures of real proteins to search for the 'best' or lowest energy structures. Results published in the journal Nature showed that the player's search methods can be successfully combined with computer-based algorithms to solve actual scientific problems.\\nThe use of video games in higher education is a real possibility and could even have a promising future in higher education given the advantages of delivering educational content through a video game format. These advantages include things such as remote access, personalized student progress and immediate feedback. However, creating an engaging video game from scratch is challenging, costly and time-consuming. As indicated by the creators of PolyCraft World, finding existing games to modify for educational purposes \\u2013 like the research missions in Spider-Man \\u2013 could be the best way forward.\\nAaron W.

      "      \"summary\": \"Children (and adults, too) need to learn the principles of ecology (how life works in community), and they need to see the connections between human beings and the rest of Nature. The urgent timeframe of global climate change means that any learning that doesn't contribute to these understandings could be considered part of the problem.\\nIndeed, the environmental crisis can be attributed in part to the inability of human beings to come up with sustainable ways of living together.\\nHere are some ways to 'ecologicalize' teaching which is being practiced by the Cordillera Ecological Center in the Philippines:\\n1. Education programs sometimes include icebreakers, warm-up activities, initiative tasks, cooperative games, or physical adventure elements. Helping people work together better will always be a good thing, and creating a sense of community is essential for being eco-friendly. But how can we integrate environmental learning into these activities without drastically changing program elements and while still contributing to group dynamics and character building? It's not easy, but it's simple: We just need to stretch what we do to include mention of and learning about the rest of our natural 'place' and community.\\n2. Ecologicalizing education means looking for principles of ecology and connections with the rest of Nature in as many of our learning activities as possible.\\n3. Follow up to any learning task that demands group work or cooperation can lead to discussion of the behaviour of fish in schools or birds in flocks. How did participants communicate to each other? Why? How do the strategies they came up with to meet their challenge compare with fish or birds dealing with a challenge such as a predator?\\n4. A group activity that demands cooperation can lead to participants discussing the similarities between humans and other social animals. For example, you can help your students learn how wolf behaviour can act as a metaphor for effective group functioning, character development and leadership. That so many roles need filling to keep a classroom working well exemplifies the connectedness of the living web \\u2014 what happens to the 'web' within the physical and emotional space of the classroom if one participant falls down on the job? And how does this compare with losing one species or degrading one aspect of an ecosystem? Let's talk about these things with students.\\n5. If your education programming already includes lots of hands-on Nature connecting, you can highlight and reinforce ecological understandings by pointing out or asking for evidence of Nature's gifts or ecosystem services in action. This could be an ambulatory activity (one you do while walking between classes or travelling to different venues), or an ongoing project throughout the year.\\n6. Nature abides by rules. Games work well and reflect Nature if they combine rules with cooperation and some 'friendly competition' (in the sense that every individual is doing his or her best). Beware of overstressing competition \\u2014 the goal, it seems, of our culture. Ecology relies on mutualism (living things relying on each other), and life is all about synergistic symbiosis. In Nature, 'the fittest' is the one who fits into its ecosystem best. This is a lesson our students desperately need to learn.\",\n",

      "      \"summary\": \"MUSKEGON, Mich. \\u2014 Scott Yonkers has been catching turtles since he was a kid, growing up on a lake in a small town. Now he's using what he's learned about turtles over the years to help them thrive. \\\"I'm very passionate about it. It's something I enjoy doing and I love giving back,\\\" he said. Yonkers learned a few things about wildlife rehabilitation when he was working as a veterinary technician and eventually he became a licensed turtle rehabilitator in Michigan. He brought a few of the turtles he's nursed back from injuries to a presentation in Muskegon Thursday night. The presentation covered identifying the 10 species of turtles in Michigan, their habitat, and some of the rehab work he does for injured turtles. Yonkers also talked about conservation efforts. \\\"Michigan does have four species of protected turtles. Those are protected largely because their populations are declining with habitat being destroyed or developed for houses or other things. Their environments are limited and some of these turtles might have to be 20 years old before they're at breeding age so that definitely hurts their environment quite a bit,\\\" he said. Yonkers says one of the best things people can do to help turtles is to know what to do if you see a turtle crossing the road. \\\"Move it in the same direction it's heading. Don't take it home. Don't take it to an environment you think is better for it. Just help it cross the road. The less interaction the better,\\\" he said. Since 2004, Michigan has been home to a Herp Atlas Project. It's a citizen science program create to document the state's amphibians and reptiles and help measure trends in their populations. The Michigan Herp Atlas relies on observations of amphibians and reptiles being submitted to the project's website. \\u25baMake it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.

      "      \"summary\": \"A Source\\u00a0Of Passion\\u00a0\\nJoshua Olatunji AYENI\\nA Nigerian student in China\\nAlthough there may be some drawbacks of taking part in extracurricular activities such as conflict of interest, time management and extra costs, the joy and fulfillment that students derive from pursuing their passions through these activities far outweigh the concerns surrounding the notion that extracurricular activities bring extra stress to the students mentally and the parents financially. This thought is nothing but phantasmagoric; as long as the activities are not forced on students, and they choose them based on their interests and capabilities.\\nIn my adolescent age, I was not deeply involved in extracurricular activities, not because of lack of interest but due to misinformation on how such undertakings could filch my time and significantly affect my studies. As time went by, I discovered that this reasoning was faulty and indirectly created some behavioral gaps and aversion in me. As I began to see the opportunities that have eluded me, I deeply regretted not participating earlier in such activities.\\nThanks to fate, I later joined some activities related to academics, volunteering and religion. Although these activities could be easily combined, my energy was focused on academics and religion. Besides peer tutoring, I was engaged in various competitions and club societies, and the experiences were thrilling and rewarding. Beyond equipping me for any form of academic challenges, extracurricular activities have helped me come in contact with dignified personalities.\\nExtracurricular activities have numerous positive impacts on the people that participate in them. They can change an overly ingenuous, introverted and reclusive person to an outright socializing individual. Since passion drives determination and commitment, extracurricular activities can bring about creativity, self-confidence, social inclusiveness, team spirit, leadership management and organizational skills.\\nThey also help students find their innate strengths, what their passions genuinely are and link them to like-minded persons.\\n\\u00a0\\nA Supplement to School Teaching\\u00a0\\nLi Shuhui\\nA civil servant in\\u00a0Jiangxi Province\\u00a0\\nThe value of extracurricular activities is recognized in China, because they provide experiences not available at school. But when it comes to extracurricular classes, especially those targeted at improving students' academic performance, opinions vary.\\nPersonally, I have benefited from these classes. When I was little, I took extracurricular piano and dancing classes at weekends. It was relaxing after a long week of study. Though I later stopped attending these classes and failed to become master of either art, I still enjoy playing piano after work sometimes.\\nThe reason I gave up was that I turned to extra mathematics and geography classes for additional tutoring in these subjects in high school, when I found it hard to keep up with the pace of school teaching. These classes did help raise my test scores.\\nSo, based on my experience, extracurricular classes are necessary and helpful when they cater to the interests and specific needs of students. But if these classes have added burdens to students, they may play a negative role to children's growth. The Ministry of Education recently set up a new department to regulate the development of the industry.\\nI think the main reason is that instead of serving as a supplement to school education, they have been trying to compete with schools by providing services that are similar to schools, but are ahead of school schedule or beyond the stipulated scope of teaching. The active promotion of their programs has made Chinese parents, who are known for caring about their children's academic performance, anxious. Those who don't want to see their children lag behind would spend a lot of money and time on these classes. I hope with government guidance, the industry can have healthy development.\\nSchools also have a part to play. I hope that in the future, schools in China can better respond to individualized needs and provide more diverse courses for students to choose from, so that students don't have to attend extracurricular classes.\",\n",
